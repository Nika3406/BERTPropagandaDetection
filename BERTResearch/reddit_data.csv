based,politics,We’re NYT reporters covering the effects of the Trump administration’s takeover of DC. Ask us anything.,"**From Zach Montague (**[**proof**](https://imgur.com/a/9nVSKJs)**):** I’m a federal courts reporter, based in Washington.  



My reporting focuses on the legal disputes over the Trump administration’s agenda and the hundreds of federal lawsuits filed since January 2025 challenging various policies and actions. 



I’ve covered the D.C. police retaining control after a court hearing and how ICE has taken a [key role](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/us/trump-immigration-dc-crime.html?unlocked_article_code=1.f08.0Dk-.D36oNmYqRxmL&smid=re-nytimes) in Trump’s crime crackdown. I’ve also written about the number of times the Trump administration has been blocked by lawsuits, including with Medicaid [funds](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/politics/planned-parenthood-medicaid-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.f08.m0GB.mRr1tARZR4k9&smid=re-nytimes) for Planned Parenthood, Trump’s birthright citizenship [order](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/us/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship-lawsuit.html?unlocked_article_code=1.f08.XhGG.gEdlX-j6myr4&smid=re-nytimes) and [free speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/us/politics/trump-trial-free-speech-student-crackdowns.html?unlocked_article_code=1.f08.5qvb.OLpo3zfu4F3F&smid=re-nytimes) on campus.

**From Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs (**[**proof**](https://imgur.com/a/u22sl6M)**):** I’m an investigative reporter for the Times’s national desk, and I’m on the ground in D.C.

I’ve spent much of the last two weeks [tracking down](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/15/us/dc-police-federal-night-scene.html?unlocked_article_code=1.f08._HgV.2KtkBf9K0euC&smid=re-nytimes) what the federal agents here are doing, whether it’s recovering guns during traffic stops or trying to evict [homeless people](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/us/politics/dc-homeless-camps-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.f08.O1hW.AqpdKkg3r8cK&smid=re-nytimes). I’ve also looked into what the [numbers show](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/15/us/trump-juvenile-crime-dc-data.html?unlocked_article_code=1.f08.hkRc.3HksrgBNWWoU&smid=re-nytimes) about children committing crimes in the District, and written about the man charged with assaulting a Border Patrol agent [with a sandwich](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/13/us/politics/federal-agent-trump-sandwich-dc.html?unlocked_article_code=1.f08._wQL.nalFNeVpcDzO&smid=re-nytimes).   

All of these links are available for free, even without an NYT subscription.

Ask us anything about what we’re seeing on the ground, the lawsuits that have ensued, and the national implications. 

We’ll answer questions from 3 to 4 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 22.

Tea Partiers will soon wake up to learn that they were duped and used like a condom, and America will not be better off economically - their jobs will continue to be shipped to China and India - Big Oil's voice is louder in Washington -and the push for war against Iran will grow - the Wall Street Bankers will still control Washington - the Fed will still be allowed to print fiat money - we will continue to imprison more citizens than any other country on earth - the Middle Class got NOTHING in this election - and don’t even get me started on California, my home state, which is officially lost forever - they passed a simple majority budget referendum - the stupidity of the American people never ceases to amaze me.

The War to control the Tea Party movement begins Nov 3rd!

The neo-conservatives won a huge victory last night - they duped patriotic Amercians into voting for them - only a couple true conservatives were elected to office - this first scrimish in the fight for America has been won by the NWO/Corpatists/globalists - when the GOP goes right back to their old habits, and that will be almost immediatly - I hope those that voted for them take notice and get active.

libtard,politics,Stakes are to vampires as truth is to libtards.,"Teresa Heinz-Kerry was worshiped by the media. She is worth an estimated $1 billion, 4 1/2 Times as much Mitt Romney!

Her money is in a plethora of tax-wise trusts! But no problem. Teresa was just great! She was covered like make-up. There was no concern with her massive wealth.

Let me make this clear: She is not Mother Theresa of Calcutta, who lived in poverty. No, this was Teresa Heinz Kerry, wife of Democrat presidential candidate.  

Heinz has employees in 200 countries. More employees outside the United States than in this country. How is that for outsourcing!

John Kerry was never vilified for his immense wealth, including the ownership of an entire island, estimated at $35 million.  ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yt0ie/stakes_are_to_vampires_as_truth_is_to_libtards/,1345903386.0,yt0ie

So don't let them get away with this transparent ploy aimed at stupid, naive, gullible retards. Whenever you see an Obot put up some foaming-at-the-mouth anti-Romney post, make sure you point out that Obama works [for the same people Romney does,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcBtMbKt-ig) but is [far, far more dangerous](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/04/growth-of-income-inequality-is-worse-under-obama-than-bush.html) because he's the far slicker, talented liar.

Do not let the donktards and Obamaloons get away with their propaganda and brainwashing campaign. Make sure you piss in their soup whenever they put up anything that attempts to distract the American people from how fucking awful Obama and the Democrats actually are.

The visit comes as Congress is considering an omnibus spending bill that includes $45 billion of emergency assistence to Ukraine, and, [as the AP reported](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-biden-e7ff8b76657a778d4921b7345682966c), as ""... the White House braces for greater resistance from a Republican-controlled House that’s signaled it will put more scrutiny on aid for Ukraine in the new Congress. GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has said his party’s lawmakers will not write a 'blank check' for Ukraine.""
This will be Zelenskyy's second address to Congress, the first having been remotely delivered in March.  The first, 20-minute address can be viewed [here on C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?518685-1/ukrainian-president-zelensky-calls-us-back-fly-zone-provide-defensive-weapons).

Speaker Nancy Pelosi [requested](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/122022-2) that of her colleagues be ""physically present"" this evening, writing:
>We are ending a very special session of the 117th Congress with legislation that makes progress for the American people as well as support for our Democracy. Please be present for a very special focus on Democracy Wednesday night.

sheep,politics,"My Open Letter to George Clooney, Matt Damon, and other Hollywood Elite supporting Hillary.","Hey everyone, content is as title says. Please feel free to share this if you feel similarly to I and my friends, and add your own sentiments in the comments. Thanks for reading. <3

To any person out there who does not believe that Class Warfare is real, we have to look no farther than the George Clooney Mega Million Dollar Fundraiser for one of the leading Flag-Bearers for the 1%, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Like George Clooney, Hillary was born to privilege, not incidentally, both claim more humble starts. 

Strange affliction that many of the 1% have-- they love to claim that they are “like” the rest of us 99%, when the truth is that any clue they had what it is really like to live struggling paycheck to paycheck, either never was in their memories or has long ago faded away.

It is very similar to certain Hollywood Hawks who love to push war and claim that they served in war and surprise, they didn't. Like George Bush the 2nd and others, as a little research will reveal.

The truth is that George, like Hillary, is not like the rest of us. I hope you both will forgive my familarity as of one of the hoi poloi, one of the many peons who are running your personal errands, cleaning for you, cooking for you, driving you from here to there and doing your lawn work. 

The rest of the US Working Class, hell, WE do all that work for ourselves.

Here is where those who don't know What they are defending or Don't Care, are getting idignant and making the same tired arguments that basically boil down to; “the 1% are just like the 99% and as they have a lot more money than we 99%, which makes them more wise than us and know what is best for us.”

The truth of the matter is, it is doubtful that any of these supporters of Hillary, again, one the most Powerful Champions that the 1% ever had, know exactly what Hillary's Record is.

The truth can set all of us, Free. I suggest to Mr. Clooney and the rest of his Elite Class do a little research and read. Or do the peons also do this work for you and the rest of your Elite Class? 

Here is Hillary's Record; the really “funny” thing about the following, it is actually pared down, for the sake of brevity and sanity. Take the Republican Welfare Law, a part of Newt's Contract On America, both Hillary and Bill supported Newt via Kasich's bill. Let's be clear, Hillary personally help put together the votes to pass this mean-spirited bill. This is a FACT.

By the way, the “mean” description is Peter Edelman's, long time friend of Bill and Hillary, who is
married to Marian Wright, founder of the Childrens Defense Fund, where Hillary loves to brag she worked. Ironic & sad as both Edelmans pleaded with Bill and Hillary NOT to support the Republicans.

Ted Kennedy called it “Legislative Child Abuse”. History shows that HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of Legal Immigrants were hurt by the Clinton Republican law. History shows that MILLIONS of Working Class Americans & Children were moved into poverty by Clinton's law. See Edelmans, CBPP.org, et al.

Facts show the work that Hillary has done on SCHIP does NOT equal the damage she helped cause by helping pass this mean spirited bill. Again, the description is Peter Edelman's, Hillary's and Bill's friend. 

Let's be Honest and Blunt; what the HELL do Mr. Clooney and his friends care about US? Or Facts?

To the inevitable chorus of sheep that “Hindsight is... blah blah”, the TRUTH is that Bill Clinton was personally handed a report showing that MILLIONS of Americans, including CHILDREN would be moved into poverty by the Clinton backed Republican law, BEFORE Bill signed this evil.

But, the Clintons were more interested in getting Republican Votes to re-elect Bill! Pragmatism-- “wow”!
And this EXACTLY what is wrong with Hillary, she has hurt the Working Class on issue after issue.
Want to talk NAFTA? Millions of good jobs lost, but the 1%, not unlike the Clooneys and their friends, who gave Big $$$ to Bill before NAFTA and later, Hillary, all saw their profits go up because of NAFTA.

How about Glass-Stegall, which worked for decades to protect the Working Class from another Great Depression? Again, the 1%, who gave Big Money to Bill and later, Hillary, all saw their profits go up. 

Only the uniformed, partisan or those who just don't give a DAMN about FACTS, ignore these Facts.

How about the Bankruptcy Bill that Hillary was against before Big Money from the Finance Sector helped make her Senator of New York? Hillary's vote trapped many Americans in a cycle of debt!

Does any of you Hollywood Elite know that Hillary has been called the Senator of Wall Street?

How about the fact that Hillary supported Single Payer which failed because of the many millions that the Insurance Industry and Big Pharma spent? This is probably something you do know.

But, do any of you Psuedo-Intellectuals find it the least bit troublesome that Hillary is now echoing the attacks of the Insurance industry and Big Pharma against Bernie Sander's Single Payer?

How about the fact that these same Multi-Billion Dollar Corporations are now giving Hillary the many millions they once spent against her? WHY would these Billion Dollar Mega-Corps give her ANY $$$?

These are FACTS, not hyperbole. Read. Do some research. Or at least stop pretending you care about Every-Day Working Class Americans who live paycheck to paycheck because of Hillary's policies! 

Mr. Clooney, YOU do know you could pay one the Working Class to do the research FOR you, right?

Most of the Hollywood Elite, like the Clooneys, pretend that they care about Anti-LGBTQ Laws and are willing to use their celebrity to fight these Bigoted laws. 

Well, that is great, but I must ask how exactly can YOU Hollywood Elite support Hillary (and Bill) who supported some of the worst Anti-LGBTQ Policies and Laws that the USA has ever known?

The Anti-LGBTQ Don't Ask Don't Tell ruined the lives and military careers of uncounted thousands and thousands using Witch Hunt Style tactics. This is Bill and Hillary “I help with Bill's policies”
Clinton, the Candidates YOU are helping over someone who actually welcomed LGBTQs as Mayor.

Is the Anti-LGBTQ DOMA supported by Hillary “I help with Bill's policies” Clinton OK with YOU?

As Senator of Wall Street, sorry, New York, Hillary said she was againt Gay Marriage (Just like Bill).  Hillary used Republican Talking Points to defend this Bigotry; “marriage between man and woman”.

See the Tweet of Hillary Rosen, one of Hillary's Many Big Buck Lobbyists. She regrets it but it is True!

One last one, Racism. Am I saying the Clintons are Racist? Well, how about YOU look at the FACTS                          and judge for yourselves.

As Govenor of Arkansa, Bill Clinton was sued by the NAACP for violating the Civil Rights of Black Americans and intefering with their right to VOTE! (Case 90-394)

Instead of fixing these Racists Laws, Bill using taxpayer money, fought the NAACP!

IF Bill was/is such a good friend to Black Americans then WHY fight to KEEP such Racist Laws?
After Losing Bill, Appealed & fought the NAACP some more. After fighting to the end, Bill Clinton lost.

This is FACT, not interpetation. Speaking to angry whites after the loss, Bill implied to them the loss was due to the Confederacy losing the Civil War. That is what another friend of Bill wrote, Lani Guinier. 

To prove his devotion to Black Americans each year Bill and Hillary celebrated Confederate Flag Day.

Hell, to show his solidarity with Black Americans, Bill signed Act 116 Honoring the Confederacy!

To those Hollywood Elite who don't get this, I'll break it down, the Confederacy was to support the Enslavement of people who looked like Don Cheadle and Kerry Washington.

Millions of Black Americans were kidnapped, tortured, beaten, raped and separated from their families!

To “Honor” the Confederacy as Bill Clinton did, is actually, EXACTLY like “Honoring” the Nazi!

And oh yeah, during Hillary's time as a Director, Wal-Mart profited off the sale of Confederate flags.

During Hillary's time as a Director of Wal-Mart for 6 years, Wal-Mart engaged in Union Busting.

Is that OK with you Hollywood SAG Members? Or the hell with Wal-Mart under-paid employees,                     YOU got yours, right, Mr. Clooney? Same question to the rest of you Elites supporting Hillary.

Wal-Mart paid Women less than Men. That still OK? IF it was your wife or mother, still OK??

Wal-Mart also paid Starvation Wages, advising employees to come to US, the taxpayers, to help feed their families, which Regular Americans could NOT do on Wal-Mart Pay. In fact, Wal-Mart has MORE workers on Welfare than any other employer in the USA! (See High Cost of Low Prices)

Is that OK with you, Mr. Clooney, Mr. Damon and the rest of you Multi-Millionaires?

Oh, let the Rationalizing and False Equivacations begin! It is so hard to admit when you are wrong!

Many Hollywood Elite, like the Clooneys, proudly join supporting Hillary with Wal-Mart, Monsanto, Tyson Foods, Verizon, GE, Bank of America and Wall Street's Goldman Sachs, to name a few.

Mega-Corps wrongdoings include Contaminating Drinking Supplies, Wrongful Evictions, Wage Theft, Unequal Pay for Women, Union Busting, Discrimantion, Fraud, Shipping jobs overseas-- hey, don't worry Mr. Clooney and the rest of you Hollywood Elite-- they are not sending YOUR jobs overseas! 

Mr. Damon, do you REALLY support this kind of Record? Does the Who really matter more than the What? WE would all love to see a Woman in the White House, but how about someone who has a Record that deserves the White House? Like Ms. Harris of California or any thousands of other women!

Do ANY of you Elite even care that Bernie Sanders opposed ALL of these? Two examples; as Hillary was supporting Anti-LGBTQ policies, there is video of Bernie defending Gays in Congress. As Hillary was campaigning for Goldwater, beloved for voting against Civil Rights for people who look like Bakari Sellers and Jason George, Bernie was being arrested in Hillary's hometown for Protesting Segregation. 

At the risk of stating the obvious, the differences in these examples is this is about CHARACTER of Bernie and Hillary rather than their Policy!



Mr. Clooney, with all respect, your beautiful wife seems to do good works, so WHY would the two of you want to support a candidate who takes Many Millions* from the leaders of countries that abuse their Women Citizens with Rape, Public Beatings, Child Marriage, Sexual Servitude and Death By Stoning?

(*Thru the Clinton Foundations)

In the name of all that is sacred, anyone defending this, please do NOT give the “Wall Street Defense”  that “only by taking their many millions can Hillary stop the abuses”!!

Dr. Martin Luther King Boycotts NOT doing business with!

WHY are you raising money for someone who is such a Powerful Champion of the 1%?!

$353,400.00 just to sit by the Senator of Wall Steet, $30k for  a picture with Hillary!

How about donating this money to the people who are being kicked off of SNAP everyday (NY and other States) DIRECTLY** because of the Clinton Welfare Law? (**According, again to cbpp.org)

Maybe our Brave Veterans and their families? Bernie stood by himself, against Hillary, 99 to 1.

Many times Principle is more valuable than Pragmatism, even in Politics.

To sum up; Hillary's policies have helped the 1% and have badly hurt the Working Class.

Mr. Clooney, YOUR support for Hillary, along with the other Hollywood Elite is uninformed and sad.

Once again, the 1% are on the wrong side of History. And the wrong side of the fight for our very souls!",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4f4i37/my_open_letter_to_george_clooney_matt_damon_and/,1460853467.0,4f4i37
sheep,politics,Accept Obama for What He Is: The Perfect Candidate to Inspire the Revolution,"There has never been a better time for We the People to collectively demand justice, as all three branches of government are widely despised as corrupt beyond belief. The facts on how politicians sold out America have never been more blatant, even a third-grader can see it. Anyone capable of rational thought (not on prescription meds), can see the obvious truth that both parties are on the same team, it's just a game of good cop, bad cop.

We don't have a two party system, we have two wings from the same party battling about who gets the blame; but in the end, no matter who's in charge, the result will be the same.

NAFTA
Clinton-Gore passed NAFTA, in fact it was Gore's little baby.  Yet this jerkwad claims to be an environmentalist, while NAFTA shipped the jobs south to countries with no environmental laws. Rather the protecting the earth, NAFTA poisoned the land with all the chemicals banned in America. Of course NAFTA was also the beginning of the end of our manufacturing base. Then Clinton/Gore passed the WTO and China PNTR agreements, the kill strokes for our manufacturing sector... but they called it free trade so it must be good.

Any intelligent American can look around and see cities like Detroit, ravaged, with factories closed, steel mills shut down... while our politicians tell us to accept the new 'service economy'. It's a fucking outrage! To Congress and the media: Fuck your service economy you fucking sellouts. If the Republicans were any better, Bush would have reversed this policy, instead he called for more ""free trade"", then stood by and did nothing as Miami riot cops brutalized Americans protesting the FTAA.

Fracking
The whole audience laughed when Nancy Pelosi told John Stewart that the Democrats are the green party. Obama's big claim to success was the booming oil and gas industry. But he didn't mention fracking, or dumping millions of gallons of 500 'trade secret' chemicals into the ground, contaminating groundwater across the country. No environmentalist would allow that to happen... yet it seems our President either doesn't know about the controversy, or he doesn't care.

Gas Prices
If we're suddenly surpassing Saudi Arabia in oil production, why are gas prices still so high?  Why are they trying to export our oil?  If we were dependent of foreign oil, and it was a national security issue, then why don't we keep all of our oil, for national security in the long term?

If the oil is extracted in Texas or North Dakota, it doesn't have to be shipped halfway around the world, but rather than pass on the savings to the consumer, the oil companies keep the prices artificially high with speculators manipulating the market.  I've got an idea, why don't we just nationalize all the oil.... it's our oil as a nation, it doesn't belong to Exxon.  Well pump it out of the ground and charge our citizens just enough... so instead of $40 billion profit per year going to Exxon, American citizens will save $40 B in gas bills.  This would be a huge boom to the economy, as shipping prices will drop, families can go on vacation again, buying food and hotel rooms, restaurants, theaters, everything will boom because people will finally have some cash to spend.

Ending oil speculation would do more to boost the economy than all of the ""stimulus packages"" put together. Yet the banks don't want this, so it will never happen with the current one-party system.

Now is the Time, as nobody likes any part of our government

1. Congress
Numerous polls show Congress' approval rating at about 8%; in other words, 92% of Americans don't trust Congress. And for good reason, as the most accurate term to describe the lot of them is 'useful idiots'.  It doesn't have to be a huge conspiracy, most of Congress are just dipshits, plain and simple. They watch tv news and think that's the real news... completely oblivious to the fact that it's all censored bullshit.

2.  The Supreme Joke
With the Supreme Court now populated by employees of Monsanto, Goldman Sachs, etc., every single ruling can be predicted... to come down in favor of the corporations. FLASHBACK: The Supreme Court officially became a laughing stock in Dec 2000, when they held an emergency session at 8am on a Saturday morning, to halt the Florida Recount on the grounds of..... it might cause irreparable harm to petitioner George W. Bush.

3. Obama was supposed to be the agent for change, instead he turned out to be just another poser. He is the textbook definition of Uncle Tom- the black man that screws over his own people to gain favor with the slave masters.  Ironically, the only people that like Obama, and frequently call his critics racist, are themselves guilty of reverse racism... believing that Obama must be good, must be fighting for the little guy, because he's black.  Ha Ha. 

Anyone aware of the facts of the 'foreclosure crisis' knows that Obama is an absolute scum that allowed the 'too big to fail' banks to steal millions of homes.  They illegally foreclosed on millions of homes by hiring 20,000 robosigners, and Obama let them walk.  Nobody went jail... instead they paid a fine of $2000 per stolen house!  It would be nice if these millions of homeowners surrounded the White House with pitchforks, but having lost their home, they probably can't afford a trip to DC.

Obama, the 'Nobel Peace Prize' winner, who campaigned on closing Guantanamo, actually authorized $196 million upgrade for it last year. He campaigned on ""Universal Health Care,"" but once in office he said we have a 'legacy' system that can't be changed. wtf?!  I'm not making this up, he's the fraud that claimed one thing to get elected, then reversed all his positions after getting into office.  Obama is closer to Bush III than any sort of liberal.

So to sum up, we have:
The Supreme Court Joke
A Congress that 92% dislikes
A President that no Republicans like
A President that no thinking Democrats like

The only people that like B.O. are those that listen to Rush Limbaugh hating on Barrack, and deduce, well if Rush hates Obama, he must be good.

The best part about Obama is that Republicans despise him, most military and police included. If we were to protest and Demand Bush step down, the cops would brutally beat you.  But now, at least there is a chance that they will agree Obama is a poser stooge that ought to stand trial for treason... doesn't anyone else remember how all public officials take an oath of office, ""To Uphold and Defend The Constitution"" from all enemies, foreign and domestic.  The NSA revelations prove he has not upheld his oath- period.  Having done nothing about it, Congress has also failed to uphold their oath. Based on third grade logic, our entire government has already broken their sworn oaths of office, they should all be thrown out immediately.  And don't give me that vote 'em out bull either.... if you've been paying attention at all, you know the electronic voting system has made the elections easily hackable... but the funny part is, it's not needed in most cases as both candidates are pre-selected stooges... go ahead folks, vote on whoever you want, Hillary or Jeb, we don't care.

Which brings us to the real problem... if everyone hates our government, why can't we get anywhere?

""The best way to control the opposition is to lead it yourself"" - Lenin

The Occupy Movement and nearly every protest movement across the country has been infiltrated. This part may sound crazy conspiracy if you've not already heard of CoIntelPro, the FBI's counter-intelligence program from the '60s, where they spied on MLK and their stated goal was to infiltrate, discredit and disrupt the anti-war movement.

From my firsthand experience I can tell you that, at your local protest, the 'minders' will show up in numbers, and will most likely be leading the group.  In a small town, anti-war leaders that raised money to put a Japanese peace symbol ad in the local paper, but when offered a free website to facilitate communications, they weren't interested.  At the protest, they worked hard to ensure that the speakers kept repeating the same useless stuff, war is bad, end the war, blah blah.... but if one were to stand up and suggest we take the protest to the local tv station, to confront the newsreaders about why they withhold important facts from their broadcasts, to demand those facts be aired- this person will likely be shouted off stage... or told, 'good idea, put it in writing' ... or join our media outreach committee.

We don't need a freakin' committee you assholes, the tv station is just a mile away- we just need to start walking in that direction, right now

""Ohhh nooooo, we can't have that!""

The way to expose the frauds is to have the conversation, demanding a logical reason why the protest is not organized at the local tv or radio station.  We all know the stations love to report on the protests as a few malcontents, while failing to mention any of the real issues.  At the local protest, as you try to encourage the group to march to the tv station to demand truth on the air, the minders will all agree it can't be done.  And somehow, as if they have a magic mist, they are able to convince everyone in the crowd to just go along with them... even though there is no logic to their plan, which is usually akin to, 'see you next year.'

Imagine this scenario... Occupy New York City, New Years Eve.  Some of the Occupy group are trying to get the protest to organize in Times Square for the big night, complete with thousands of flyers depicting the crimes of our 'elected' leaders and their wall street masters. But this idea was squashed, instead 'they' voted to retake Zucotti Park. So instead of mingling and informing a million sheep on how they've been had, the Occupy NYC opted to get beaten and arrested again.  Good idea guys.

This is why 'they' are winning- because they have minders like this all over the country.  Of course your first thought is, ""Who would be a minder like this? This can't be true."" So to this I say, first read this story about a modern day cult (that actually sprayed a pharmaceutical mist on people)....
http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/love-and-death-in-the-house-of-prayer-20140121
 then go out to your local protest and see for yourself- try to steer the group toward a direct action at a local media outlet... and watch (film) the people step forward to shut you down.

The first step to overcoming a problem is acknowledging you have one. We The People will never overcome our corrupt government until we recognize and deal with the minders everywhere.


ps- Unless we get lucky and

1. The Masters of Evil (Cheney, Kochs?) have heart attacks and the minions shed their programming.

Or better yet

2. People everywhere realize that the anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety pharmaceuticals are turning them into apathetic zombies. This valentines day the meme goes viral, if you love someone, dump out their medicine cabinet... then lock them in a room for a week while they detox. The next week when people return to their rational selves, and they see what has happened during their slumber... the anger will have our politicians fleeing like they're in Thailand... out the back door, hopping the fence to escape as the mad throng of citizens rush to beat the shit out of them.

sheep,politics,Romney’s Economic and Social Suicide Pact,"While most Americans are distracted with modern day bread and circuses (read: Food Stamps and Hollywood movies, video games, and internet) and trying to struggle to earn a living with permanently contracted economy, you have two choices this “election” season: Barack Obama, a president which has to battle a Congress that has done relatively little and has been obstructive to recovering from the artificial crash of 2008 due to the Republicans still offended that the White House is occupied by a Black-American, and a candidate which advertises himself someone who will “bring back America”. The only problem is that we are already seeing him as a false savior, offering economic salvation, while in reality will bring American down, destroy America from the inside out while he’ll escape with golden parachute. This name, this false savior has a name, and that name is Mitt Romney. 

Yeah, the same Mitt Romney, who is a Mormon. The same Mitt Romney that supported his own brand of universal health care in Massachusetts, only to oppose it when because Obama is a perceived Socialist. The only reason why Mitt Romney wants to run is to finish the job the corporatists at Wall Street and K Street want and are using the Tea Party as puppets for: Turn America into a third-world country where there is no middle class, only the working-poor and the upper class. 

If you vote for Romney, here’s what you should expect: 

For you people who like low-taxes and don’t want taxes: He will lower taxes, if you’re wealthy. He’ll extend tax cuts from the Bush Administration and extend them. Meanwhile you will pay more in income taxes and that increase in income taxes will head straight for funding more tax cuts, subsidies for corporations, and for the military, homeland security (security theater), and prison industrial complexes. Yeah, all that tax money will go straight to the people that are donating in Mitt Romney’s campaign. 

For those unemployed and unemployable: He’ll promise you economic salvation from unemployment and joblessness with an increase of jobs. Instead with the tax-cuts he will implement, it will further enable corporation, I mean “job-creators” (or is it wealth-hoarders?) will do what all so called job creators do: Cut more jobs to get more profits, and when they feel like they’ll add more jobs. But these jobs will be either part-time work or short-term contract work, not full-time long term employment. 

For those who care about education: He’ll finish the phase out of public schooling via the No (Rich) Child Behind Act. He’ll practically defund already struggling schools of federal aid with vouchers towards charter schools or private school, which may charge about the set amount of the vouchers or worse nickel and dime you for extra stuff necessary for school. College students: He’ll cut student aid including the Pell Grants, and will make college unaffordable unless you’re willing to take loans. 

He’ll promise to reduce big government, but he’s going to cut big government in all the wrong places. Instead of cutting fat, he’ll cut big government in places already lean (or muscular). He’ll make the classic and modern arts only reachable for the wealthy and poor. He’ll privatize what’s left of United States Postal Service, open public broadcasting to commercial pressures and allow it to be no different than the reality TV filled cable channels it’s supposed to be different from. He’ll take down every regulation which you take for granted: Environment, food, health and safety, trading standards, everything necessary regulation that protects everyone, except corporate profits. 

As for Obamacare, and those who need it the most: He’ll appeal it and replace it with absolutely nothing. He’ll rather have the states do something about health care, which we all know with the Health Insurance lobbies have bought our state representatives, will do little about it. Medicaid? Yeah he’ll cut funds for it too. He’ll also cut funds for disability services, mental health services, which already strain already understaffed services. 

For those of you who need food stamps, unemployment benefits, and welfare? He’ll cut what’s little remaining of the social safety net, and will make it difficult to get them even if you need it. Most likely if elected, he’ll order the relevant Departments to make the sure that if you have any asset that makes you middle class (like a television, computer, refrigerator), even if you bought it used, owned it for a long time, or scrimped and saved it you won’t get the help you need. 

Finally, your precious Social Security: He’s going to have the balls to privatize it into the stock market, which we all know how that went when Argentina under the fascist military junta implement it. 

Females: Romney expects you to have a baby, even if you are raped, a victim of incest, or dying. Apparently, like most Republicans: Fetuses are more important than the actual child. Oh, he’ll try to repeal any recent laws about bringing fair pay to females in the country. 

Immigrants, especially children who are brought to America with their parents: Romney will try to deport you, even if you are culturally naturalized and pay taxes to keep the economy from getting worse. You will be deported to a country your children can’t speak the language of, and if your children just graduated from high school; well they’re practically sentenced to a life time of poverty and illiteracy. 

Oh, as for Wall Street reforms that are needed: Romney will just trust them not to do it again, when in reality the banks will repeat the same mistakes again with the intent of making a profit knowing that the US Government will socialize the losses. No real reforms to the financial sector and any reforms will be Band-Aids which do mostly nothing. 

Romney as expected as a corporate raider wants to solve American problems with experience as a venture capitalist. To put in simpler terms, he’s bringing Austerity to America, but he’s not saying the actual word. He’s bringing the already failed Austerity measures from the UK, Spain, and most of all Greece to America, with all the human costs with it. 

The real question you should be asking is where these cuts actually do? Let me tell you, these are not actually cuts: I call it reprioritizing the budget. And he’s going to reprioritizing it towards his corporate buddies. Which means your tax money will be used to pay for the tax cuts, more corporate subsidies, and for the enlarging the already big prison, homeland security (security theater), and military-industrial complex. So yeah, he really doesn’t like big government unless it benefits him and his corporate buddies. 

If any Tea Partiers are reading this: You must know that Romney does not care about you, you are nothing to him but dollar signs. He will basically destroy or privatize everything that benefits the American public as a whole. The only people Romney cares in the long run are the wealthy, and he’s using you as sheep. As sheep Romney will fool you into the path to economic salvation, which in reality he’ll lead you to your suicide with the false gospel of Austerity. And when it’s promised time has come, it will be too late, and Romney and his buddies will be the ones truly benefiting, while you lose. 

Romney is a corporate raider through not to mention a dishonest politician and a ungrateful person who has used public funds all his life and completely ignorant of the fact that every American person or business uses or benefits from things and services that are in part funded by the Government in some sort of way. He cares about large government, but only cares about the large government he’ll benefit after he destroys whatever is left from the economy. 

Vote form Romney and effectively you’ll sign America’s economic and social suicide pact, which Mitt Romney will back out the instant he’s moves into the White House. 

Don’t vote for Romney this election season. And vote out any Republican who has the same or similar platform as Romney. It might not solve the root causes of our problems, but it’s a start.

sheep,politics,"Why im not voting this year, long post, comments appreciated","[1] http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2012/08/08/the-dispossessed-majority/

You should read my writing below. This will tell you more about me than some shitty Facebook game, or tweet about getting wasted at a bar. ""I don't think i will vote this time, it wont make a difference"". I remember when people would say that to me when I was younger, my naive response was always,""If everyone thought like you and didn't vote, the system couldn't work, so everyone needs to vote"" At the time I thought candidates received the nominations from there respective parties based on who was the most popular amongst the people, then that person would debate 1-2 other people on the national level and they would have amazing word battles that show each candidates strengths and weakness, and show how they are dis-similar while at the same time showing how much they respect the American people.

Now I realize it doesn't matter which side you pick, both main parties are the same thing with a slightly different wrapper. I don't want to hear about certain social issues at a national level, as the country is too divided about those and its inflammatory (I do believe social equality is VERY important, My problem is with the way those arguments are presented, its like when kids fight in middle school, after the fight, both sides still think they are correct), but that's what the 24 hour news networks will show. EVERY DAY for the next 3 months.

I don't want to help chick filet win or lose customers, I want the news to show Obama's fight to weasel his power of indefinite detention of Americans back ([2] http://www.businessinsider.com/indefinite-detention-of-americansprogress-in-fed-court-update-2012-8).

I want an investigative journalist to stand up to these people and fight for there whistle blowers rights that are being stripped away. [3] http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/squelching-public-interest-in-national-security/2012/07/30/gJQAF0pHLX_story.html

I want to see someone OPPOSE the PATRIOT act, and see it as no better that what the NAZI's did in the Reich-stag Fire Decree [4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_Fire_Decree .

I want to see a candidate willing to stand up for the rights of the sheep who vote them in power. I want to see someone who opposes Citizens United, the legal maneuvering that makes $$$=Free Speech and UNLIMITED campaign contributions (Like those made by ChickFilet) legal.

I want to see actual healthcare for everyone provided by everyone, not some new shitty TAX that really only benefits the Private health insurance industry (Which I actually work in, kinda)

I want to see someone who wants to rebuild OUR roads, bridges, infrastructure, power grid, and communities not those that we continue to blow up in other Sovereign Nations. (also, we should stop destroying other peoples infrastructure)

I want someone who sees US for what we are, bullies, and is willing to correct the current crash course we are on. (If we were doing these things to 'free' the people there, why did we stop, why aren't we in Bahrain or UAE where the crimes against humanity are much worse than those committed by Saddam

I want someone who will go after these banking elite, taking them down for manipulating LIBOR(Over 800 TRILLION in loans tied to this) and the Gold markets, and possibly the silver markets. There greed and self servitude drove million of dumb Americans to buy things they could not afford, then default. Plunging us into our great depression [5] http://finance.yahoo.com/news/libor-scandal-dummies-191701010.html

I want to see a candidate that is from the middle class, who respects the middle class. We don't have much time, because the ""Middle"" class is shrinking each day. Our national unemployment figures, when you count the people that have stopped looking for a job, is at great depression levels. [6] http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/us/middle-class-areas-shrink-as-income-gap-grows-report-finds.html

We do have problems, and neither candidate will fix them, so I will remain silent this time. In reality, there is no choice. Mitt and Barack are so similar on so many important Federal issues, they are the same candidate. [7] http://www.robertphoenix.com/content/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Oromney.jpg 

I want someone who is willing to reign in the CIA NSA FBI ATF and the other organizations who hide behind some banner of ""Servitude"" but are really quite self serving.(I dislike Fox news as much as the next sane person, but Ben Swann is making some very interesting points) They are funding and training the same people that possibly killed 3K Americans on 9-11-2001 and for sure are killing our men and women in the middle east.

The current battle for the internet is more like a massacre. Both sides of the isle want unlimited access to the net to monitor and control, they have attempted to push through at least 5 ridiculous bills like SOPA PIPA ACTA and the others. Now because both sides couldn't decide on the best plan of tyranny, the President is stating he will use his authority of Executive Orders to put rules and regulations in place, bypassing OUR Representatives. The free people of the internet have no defense, there is no one standing up for the rights of this technology, While you fight over chicken sandwiches, the politicians are hurriedly attempting to neuter and control the net. This may not seem important now, but it will be. [9] http://news.yahoo.com/white-house-considers-executive-order-leaves-internet-takeover-041809292.html

sheep,politics,This is my opinion on the direction our government has been headed for many years. I'm ready for it to be downvoted to oblivion and to receive much criticism.,"My biggest problem with this presidency is that he authorized a drone attack on an American citizen, and an American drone attack in Yemen which killed a 16-year-old American teenager. I do not support his plans for healthcare reform. I cannot believe his claims of transparency. I'm tired of every president coming into office by promising the end of war, an age of peace, to defend our civil liberties. They say that they herald a new beginning and the young and the naive flock to them like sheep. They claim to be heralding a great new beginning, they lie to us, they are harbingers of hate and intolerance. They take our youth and treat them as cannon fodder for wars which we don't want. They encroach on our freedoms, saying it is for our protection. Well I say that you have no right. Those amendments are there for our protection, and your Orwellian-style authoritarian intrusion into our privacy is just short of arresting people for thought crimes. Too long has the government claimed they act in the best interests of the American people. Who are you to say what is best for us? Our government officials should fear the people, they should be submissive to those who elect them into legislatures, who pay their salaries.

sheep,politics,I really had no idea of history of the political parties in America. WWII turned it all upside down? I would have been a republican?,"I've always heard words tossed around of ""Lincoln Republican"" but had no idea. I vote with what I agree with now, I don't care what the party is called.. I just happen to agree with Democrats.

Tonight research called to me though. Something didn't sit right. There is just no way, in this country.. The current republican party would have ever come to power using it's stances now. So I read, researched, and thought.

HOLY SHIT. Democrats were the racists? Republicans loved tariffs, unions, championed the railroads, interstate.. all kinds of great things? I'm trying to wrap my head around the idea that a political party could change so radically in 60-70 years?

Reagan is championed as the greatest republican ever. So I had to give the guy a look. Besides the tax system, and some social issues, his ideals align more with the democratic party of today then they do the republicans. Even our last president Bush. He had a lot of things that were just crazy. Reading it all now though, makes him seem like a sheep. The patriot act was horrible, at least I think. The wars, CRAZY and that is from a vet. All those things he did though, he at least tried to pretend to show some bipartisanship. I hated him.. at the time. Now reading his stances just a few years later, I can't say I agree with most of, if not all of his solutions to problems. I can though, see how they could be thought to work, and some may have. 

WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED. Am I just perceiving everything differently now? It used to, even in Regan days.. be two parties.. fighting like sissy girls, but figuring something out. Then in the 90's a few republicans got really ballsy, and fucked with Clinton. It caused the government shutdown, because Clinton was like ""Fuck raising medicare, lets pay for schools, and do cool shit"" This is the first sign I can really see of ""True Insanity"", as they screwed over a bunch of people by not fixing stuff. It's the first time, the GOP threatened to not raise the debt ceiling. IT SCREWED THEM, and President ""blow me under the table"" was able to get a 2nd term. It actually makes me feel a little bad for Dole, as basically his own party fucked him. The American People were smart enough to see what happened.

Now we sit, it's 2012, time for elections. Since 2010 I have been bombarded from every corner with the most ridiculous shit. I love friendly debate of politics. Hell.. that's the point of democracy. We all talk about it, get in a fight, get drunk, make threats, and then eventually.. we give some shit up.. and get a long. I now refuse to simply speak to anyone in person about any of it. I just can't fathom how some people can actually believe the shitty ass stance of the Republican party.

Rich getting richer will get me money?

The unions that fight for workers, made up of workers is the problem? What the hell is that? Democracy is best, until people use it themselves?

What Joe and Dave call living together, and having glorious man-love sex will affect my life? Amber and Amy raising a kid is going to make my kids suffer? Certainly don't let them call what they are going to do with or without our permission ""marriage"". As long as they don't get to call it that though, it's cool. 

You are a gift of life, of god.. in your mothers womb. The second you come out though, education is on your own.. and you better hope you have food. That's the way our founding fathers would have wanted it. Jesus helps those that helps themselves.



I know this is a rant. I'm preaching to the choir here. BUT HOLY SHIT REPUBLICANS. You give me a pre 1950's republican and you can have my vote. I human being that could give a shit less about my religion. A guy that is like ""Hey, monopoly, and owning the patents to everything.. and ripping people off is not cool"". A person that truly believes we are created equally. Nobody gets special treatment, Nobody is treated like a 2nd rate human. Support strong ""take care of us first"" viewpoint. Support a fair tax rate, and stupid high tariffs. Spend as much money as possible, as long as it's done so responsibly. 



Just wow. I've never been more disappointed in my life. How can a party that was founded on so much hope, promise, and straight up 'merica as it should be.. fall so far and lose touch with what is important.

What happened to that party would be like America turning into Iran or China, Then talking shit the Iranians for wanting to be more like America.**",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/tsx4m/i_really_had_no_idea_of_history_of_the_political/,1337321210.0,tsx4m
sheep,politics,There is no such thing as a left or a right anymore.,"Had this one brewing for awhile, from talking to people who see the light but are too lazy to then do anything.   I posted this on a political board and one my friends demanded I post it here as well.   So here goes:

There is no such thing as a left and a right anymore.

 See ladies and gentlemen ... Washington is bipartisan if you don't buy into the mainstream media's misleading narrative about left vs right.

 Speaking generally, as there are exceptions, but none of which are in leadership positions....

 Both the Republicans and Democrats support government run healthcare. The last administration from both parties massively increased government healthcare without paying for it.

 Both the Republicans and Democrats support bailing out their friends. For Republicans their friends are the banks and foreign governments. For Democrats their friends are GM and unions and green energy venture companies.

 Both the Republicans and Democrats support telling you how to run your life economically. Neither support real tax reform changes and therefore support the giant giveaway to the rich and corporations that is the current tax loophole system of 75,000 impenetrable pages. Both support large sweeping regulations. Both support the most cruel and invasive taxes ever created: inflation, property, capital gains, estate, and death.

 Both the Republicans and Democrats support telling you how to run your life socially. Both support the drug war. Both support the nanny state wanting to regulate everything down to curse words on television, radio, and even video games. A sizable minority of Republicans want to outright ban homosexuality and enforce sodomy laws. Most Democrats still don't want to recognize same sex marriage.

 Both think your privacy should flatly not exist. Both support cart blanch total surveillance of the internet, your cellphone, landlines, your emails, and your political views. Both do not think you should be guaranteed a trial by jury or that you can't be with held indefinitely or even assassinated without trial. They do this through SOPA, PIPA, the NDAA, the Military Commissions Act, and the Patriot Act.

 Both think the Constitution is an irrelevant document which can be bent or broken at will, and do not take their oath of office seriously. Most activity the government engages in is blatantly unconstitutional.

 Both are servants and whores to their corporate lobbyist masters, doing the work of the highest bidder with an agenda without remorse or regard for constituent. Both are opposed to transparency for all these same reasons.

 Both think the United States can be the policemen of the world, and run around and tell everybody what they can and cannot do, and maintain 900+ bases in 130+ countries and provide for the defense of even rich countries and spend more on defense than the rest of the planet combined. Both are believers in empire.

 Both will destroy our currency and the middle class and poor through hyperinflation. Their insistence of Keynesian economics taken to extremism ... flatly ignoring debt and spending ... thinking, as Dick Cheney said before firing the Treasury Secretary, ""that debt doesn't matter anymore"". Paired with the enablers that is the Federal Reserve and their ultrawealthy banking elite brothers in financial arms at the IMF and World Bank will sew the seeds of financial ruin.

 And lastly, both support a paramilitary police state equipped with war assault weapons, armored vehicles, Kevlar gear, aerial drones, pod towers, and whatever else they can get their hands on from the ""freebie"" bag of TSA/DoD federal money which is ultimately a form of corporate welfare to the military industrial complex. When this equipment isn't being used for spying, it is being used to serve no knock non-violent drug crime raids where shoot the dogs and anybody defending themselves from the unknown intruder and ask questions later is the standard operating procedure. Lastly, this militarization of the police state is to make sure that by the time the nation of sheep has realized it has created a government of wolves, that the sheep are substantially out gunned.

THERE IS NO LEFT OR RIGHT ANY MORE. There is only the individual vs the collective. If you wish to persist down the road of the collective to ruin ... then please, keep voting for ""electability"". Keep voting for the ""mainstream"" and ""not too radical"". Keep watching Fox News and CNN and MSNBC and thinking you're being informed and not programmed. Keep going to the voting booth and pulling the lever for that life long incumbent. Thank you for your conformity. But if you realize that, as Bastiat said, ""Government is the great fiction through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everyone else"" then it is not enough to simply vote for principle over party. It is not enough to keep yourself informed from real sources of information which aren't corporate owned pre-programming outlets more interested in molding your thoughts than augmenting them. You need to get your fat ass off the couch and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Run for office. Work or donate to a campaign that favors you over the unholy marriage between big government and big corporations. It has grown late in the evening and the sun is setting on the Republic. If you don't want Reagan's ""1000 years of darkness"", you need to start getting everybody else to turn on the lights too, not just you.

(Sick of people who have the answers but are too damned lazy to even vote that way, much less influence others.)

TL;DR:  Read it anyway.

sheep,politics,Help me point out the flaws in this argument.  My extremely conservative grandparents email me this crap all the time.,"Silence is often misinterpreted but never misquoted!

The folks who are getting the free stuff, don't like the folks who are paying for the free stuff, because the folks who are paying for the free stuff can no longer afford to pay for both the free stuff and their own stuff.

The folks who are paying for the free stuff want the free stuff to stop, and the folks who are getting the free stuff want even more free stuff on top of the free stuff they are already getting!

Now... The people who are forcing the people who pay for the free stuff have told the people who are RECEIVING the free stuff, that the people who are PAYING for the free stuff, are being mean, prejudiced, and racist.

So... The people who are GETTING the free stuff have been convinced they need to hate the people who are paying for the free stuff by the people who are forcing some people to pay for their free stuff, and giving them the free stuff in the first place.

We have let the free stuff giving go on for so long that there are now more people getting free stuff than paying for the free stuff.

Now understand this. All great democracies have committed financial suicide somewhere between 200 and 250 years after being founded. The reason? The voters figured out they could vote themselves money from the treasury by electing people who promised to give them money from the treasury in exchange for electing them.

The United States officially became a Republic in 1776, 235 years ago. The number of people now getting free stuff out number the people paying for the free stuff. We have one chance to change that. In 2012. Failure to change that spells the end of the United States as we know it.

sheep,politics,"So fellow Americans, what now?","Let's face it, America.

It's game over. It has been game over. Who didn't see it coming, though? In 2010, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission declared that corporations had unlimited free speech - effectively ending democracy and establishing a Corporatocracy. That's nothing new, though. If you've been watching anything on Reddit, you can see the implications. Million-dollar campaign donations from multi-millionares, corporate heads dodging laws easily and slyly when ordinary people are held on a pedestal of morality - and punished, and better yet, how about the rising deficit, the lowest approved congress, and the president who cries lies.

Yes. It's here, America. It's the end of you as we know it.

But really, how did it come to this point? Where did our societal checks and balances really throw us off? With respect toward the conventional political theory, we should have had a complete overhaul of our political system a long time ago. Instead, we've been stuck in a static political environment and because of this static environment, existing corporations flourish while new ones are stuck in limbo.

As a supporter of democracy, it's kind of sad to see this happen to America - where we are legitimately voting on if torture should be illegal, or if indefinite detention of citizens (or anybody) is allowed. This isn't humanitarian, freedom, or anything of the sort. It's the black mamba of corporatism slowly suffocating, choking, and eroding our nation's freedoms while you and me, the general public, are held to a higher standard and are under much stricter laws. Even if corporatism isn't to blame but rather the fear-loving presidential candidates, America isn't blind to this. We've seen through their lies - some faster than others - but we're there, together in this, now more than ever. But in a system that is hypocritical, bipolar, and broken. This system isn't equality. It's feudal.

We've seen the Occupy Wall Street movement. We know what they are about. Whether or not you support them (which you should), they have become the epitome of our ""democracy."" It doesn't take a master's in political science to see that America is no free place. Then, follow that up with 'Anonymous' declaring November 5th of 2012 the day to stand brothers at arms against the government. You see, America. It's no longer us and them, it's you and them. We've been singled out, taken control of, and most importantly, been forced to abide by half-wit rules.

But, once again, let's face it. It's game over. The guys on top - they have been on top and will continue to be on top. As a community, we are underrepresented and have been - it's just taken this long to figure it out.

Or has it been?

Reddit. We are a community of millions. A couple thousand are active. Many are political. But nothing is being done. Nothing. But yet, we have the tools. We have the backbone. We have the technology, and best yet, we have the people.

Reddit, here is my competition for you:
If you feel that this government is not representing you, let's fix it, and fix it together. It will take effort and this is where you come in. I am too young to run for political office, but some of you are not.

I suggest, to Reddit, that we find and initiate our own politicians. As a community, we should be able to find people who we believe will represent us and our ideals. There is no law stating that we have to vote republican or have to vote democrat. Today, in this age, we vote for ourselves. We don't abide by political standards: we will create our own.

Users of Reddit who are of political age and would like to become involved in politics and campaign, step forward. Even if one of us, just one, kicks a senator out of his seat - it will be a major victory for all of us. We need to campaign furiously, tell our friends and family, tell them, ""Vote for this guy - trust me."" We need to bring social norms to the political spectrum. We need to get on the ballot. We need to establish ourselves - not as the sheep, but as the herd. We might not be able to do this - it might be too late, too fruitless to fight against the powers that hold us here. It might be worthless to attempt to convince and market ourselves to our fellow communities simply because our communities don't have the intelligence nor the comprehension in politics.

sheep,politics,Fuck the Banks!,"It is morning here, so there is no news to speak of—yet. But there will be. It is clear as crystal that the root of all evil is exactly that; and those and whom it is blooming are the enemy of humanity. The bankers are the problem. The bankers manufacture recessions and depressions to exert a greater control over social and political structures. The bankers create and finance the wars on both sides of the conflicts. The bankers orchestrate famine, poverty, and want. The bankers control the policies that control the media and the education system that is operated to maintain ignorance in the public so that they can be shorn like sheep. The bankers launder the drug money and keep drugs illegal. The bankers are the problem.

The international banker is the scum of the earth; and they have to be brought to account. What will accomplish this? There are several possibilities. One of them is a “real” run on Wall Street, where the public goes into their offices and dispenses frontier justice on their person. The other is some kind of cosmic intrusion of forces that I will not begin to speculate on. And the other is some kind of financial miracle in which they actually wind up broke—but I don’t know how something like that would work. The most likely is a combination of the first two, where the second channels through the first. Once the cost of food, lodging, and fuel hits a certain point, the public will be universally galvanized by the force that builds up from the pressure of their asses against the wall.

We can be there in a few days. Once the system begins to collapse, it will have its own speed of free fall and things will move at a spectacular rate of change. It will be like the way weather can suddenly transform in the South Seas. At the point when this begins to occur, the probability of global conflict will accelerate to maximum thrust. This is the primary truth of our imperial currency activity—when the money goes south, violent attention goes east.

Yes, maybe it all will just limp along on crutches while plastered with band aids, but that goes contrary to the mathematics. You can spread the numbers only so thinly; or you can only press them together so much, and you’re going to get holes appearing in the net all over the place. Or you’re going to get implosion.

Do I have any idea what I am talking about? It is possible that I do not. There is an area where allegorical poetry gains a mystical influx of metaphysical certainty that is no different from the theoretical physics—where theory is just another word for “things we don’t want to accept as inevitable.”

Maybe “freedom” is just another word for “no one left to screw.”

It stands to reason that sooner or later the public will have no further option but to declare open season on the bankers. They’ll be hunted down as the be-all-end-all of everything dangerous and wrong. They are a plague and a pestilence as bad as any epidemic. They are the whisky and yellow blankets on the reservations of ordinary life. They are anthrax masquerading as Sweet-N-Low. They are the longstanding source of the majority of humanity’s problems and they have little competition except for the ubiquitous presence of ignorance and impossible dreams. Whoever these bankers are, that is who they are. When the shit hits the fan, as it is going to do at any moment, the guilt of the banksters is going to stand out like zits on a beauty queen.

The transformation in the mind of the public is going to be immediate. People watch the news—and although it is nothing more than garbage and lies, the players have all been seen there. They’ve been seen in Congress, and they have been seen wherever the lie is created to defend them and been publicized. They are a known quantity. There is no argument of any kind that can be used to generate sympathy for the bankers who are behind or finance every outrage against the public that is in existence. Now, their day is at hand.

And they show no signs of having any kind of clue. They sit at their vanities and admire their image like Mary Antoinette. They whoop it up like Louis XVI of Versailles, surrounded by gold leaf wallpaper and sycophants while they diddle the sons and daughters of a dying empire that they brought to pass.

There is mercy to be found here but none of it can be for the banksters who have acted with none in the intentional effort to beggar, mutilate, maim and destroy anyone and everyone who is not them. That mercy is for the public who, like Lefty, only did what he had to do. I tried to get my heart and head around it; I tried to see an out for everyone. But the only out I can see for the banksters is OUT of our lives; and marched, still living, through the gates of Hell where they can reunite with the Banker and Chief.

I’m not the judge or executioner—I am an observer who never had enough money to even think about the banks in the first place. Now the bankers tightly cross what is going to turn into flaming coals in their hands and judgment is going to cry out from the earth that they walk upon and have plundered at will. That will is now going to be drained away into fear and apprehension. Their fortress walls are going to fall away. Their protectors are going to turn on them. Their holdings are going to dissolve and spill from their fingers like a hand full of sand. I wouldn’t want to be a bankster today, or on any other day. 

The existence of a system has kept them safe. This corrupt system has allowed for some kind of life for those preyed upon until now. Now it is turned upon those whose compliance has been forthcoming for so long; soon, that compliance will be gone.

sheep,politics,"""Americans Elect"" -- Many Flaws","I am concerned about the recent online presidential nomination effort called ""Americans Elect."" It proposes to get signatures to get on the ballot in 50 states and allow people to use the internet to nominate a public official for the presidential ballot in 2012. I learned of this effort from a girl asking me to sign a petition in downtown Portland, OR, but I didn't sign the petition, wanting to research the matter. 

Now that I have researched it slightly, I have some doubts about ""Americans Elect.""

First of all, I do not like the fact that their only candidates are current public officials. I understand not wanting Rick Astley to be able to get a nod, but frankly I would feel a lot better about this thing if any citizen who is legally able to be elected president could submit themselves as a potential nominee and compete against the career politicians. Maybe there's someone out there who would never normally be a politician but would actually make the best president.

Secondly, I am concerned with the level of opacity regarding who is behind Americans Elect. Its website does not give a single real name, address, or phone number for who is behind it. It could be literally anyone. I think that is a huge HUGE red flag, right there. 

Thirdly, I am concerned with the security of the technology being used for Americans Elect. They make some pretty bold claims about how secure it is, and how it uses print-outs, and has some type of method for making sure voters are registered. It also says it will use a panel of independent people to monitor the process, but how do we know those people will have a clue what AES or SSL are? How will these people really be able to monitor what's going on?

Fourthly, I am dubious of the real, long-term goals of Americans Elect. They make the disturbing claim that they ""are building a state-of-the-art, secure voting process."" It all makes me wonder what their ultimate goal for this process is. I am very leery of attempts to sabotage the future of online voting in this country. If Americans Elect were to get hacked or have some type of major technical problem, then it would undermine the confidence of the public in online voting as a whole, and perhaps delay the coming of a real, true online voting system for years. Not to be a naysayer, but without knowing who these people are, we have no way to know if perhaps they plan to have it fail.

I hope and expect that eventually, online voting will be part of every election in the US. However, I think it needs to be done by the people, through legislation and through our democratic process and government institutions. I am concerned that Americans Elect very well might be aiming to lead us away from that... a wolf in sheep's clothing. If I'm wrong, please set me straight. 

I doubt anyone here cares more about the future of online voting in this country than me, so don't take this as me being against online voting. I just want to see it done right, and I'm more than happy to explain what I would consider as ""it being done right"" if anyone wants to know.

Please forgive any typo's, I don't have time to proof this.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mid61/americans_elect_many_flaws/,1321737443.0,mid61
sheep,politics,"OWS, this is the disinformation we're up against...","**I recently received this chain email from a family member and found it rather difficult to get through...**

WILL USA SURVIVE?


The folks who are getting the free stuff, don't like the folks who are paying for the free stuff, because the folks who are paying for the free stuff can no longer afford to pay for both the free stuff and their own stuff.

The folks who are paying for the free stuff want the free stuff to stop, and the folks who are getting the free stuff want even more free stuff on top of the free stuff they are already getting!

Now... The people who are forcing the people who pay for the free stuff have told the people who are RECEIVING the free stuff, that the people who are PAYING for the free stuff, are being mean, prejudiced, and racist.

So... The people who are GETTING the free stuff have been convinced they need to hate the people who are paying for the free stuff by the people who are forcing some people to pay for their free stuff, and giving them the free stuff in the first place.

We have let the free stuff giving go on for so long that there are now more people getting free stuff than paying for the free stuff.

Now understand this. All great democracies have committed financial suicide somewhere between 200 and 250 years after being founded. The reason? The voters figured out they could vote themselves money from the treasury by electing people who promised to give them money from the treasury in exchange for electing them.

The United States officially became a Republic in 1776, 235 years ago. The number of people now getting free stuff outnumbers the people paying for the free stuff. We have one chance to change that. In 2012. Failure to change that spells the end of the United States as we know it.

**Woah, so here's my reply:**

""Wow I'm actually offended by this, no perspective whatsoever...just 400 people own more wealth than the bottom 140 million COMBINED....USA has the greatest income inequality in any industrialized nation and rivals that of many African dictatorships.

Hello trickle down does not work! When wealth is accumulated at the top as drastically as it is now, it is hoarded and not circulated back into society.  We saw this result recently after 10 years of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, costing the US treasury $11 MILLION every hour!!!  

Wages for the vast majority of americans remained stagnant while executive compensation has skyrocketed.  Benefits to workers are constantly cut in pursuit of ever increasing profits (corporate profits went up 80% since the crash, wages- 1-2%).  Meanwhile companies like Bank of America earn over $6 billion last year and RECEIVED  a $1 BILLION tax credit.  That's 1 BILLION dollars of taxpayer money that could've repaired schools and bridge and highway infrastructure thats crumbling to dangerous levels. 

The reason societies collapse financially after 200 or so years is because the government and justice systems become so skewed by corruption and greed by that point those governing are no longer serving those that consent to be governed. Economy collapses, MILLIONS of people unemployed, education and infrastructure have been cut to the bone as a result, and 2000 protestors arrested and how many wealthy powerful bank executives are even facing litigation?   0.  There are currently 4.67 applicants for every 1 available job, I assure you those on welfare didn't cause that.

That email unfairly characterizes anybody receiving aid as ungrateful, unintelligent and most disgustingly unworthy of assistance.  22% of children in the US live below the poverty line but lets tax their families more than someone making over $500,000/yr, a Christian nation indeed.  Please be educated on the issues before forwarding me garbage like this. 

Numbers don't lie, but politicians do.  

Love you lots! But this email is horrible and neoconservative garbage""

That's great you enjoy having the bar set so high in America where people often need to work 60 hours per week to get by anymore.

Unfortunately not all people are born with the mind of a drone bee, and we like to think America has more to offer than being a wage slave.

That you were lucky enough to be able to afford to go to a college you want...

That you're lucky enough to even find a job that pays a fair living wage...

It doesn't mean everyone can do this, and doesn't mean it's RIGHT. 

This is not how the ""greatest country in the world"" should be. 

Other countries are doing it better than we are if you dare believe there's actually a world beyond America. The crap the middle class and poor have to go through anymore just to keep afloat is necessary only to keep the plutocracy churning. Many of you accept this burden because you're so beaten down into accepting wage slavery as just how it is in America, that you no longer possess the capacity to dream big or even have any hobbies; you're happy with working every waking minute of your life away. The life has been grinded out of you slowly but surely and you just accept it.

Good for you. Other people however think this is bullshit.

brainwashed,politics,"The Difference between Democracy and an Oglicarchy, and the true intentions of ""Incremental Politics""","Voting for one candidate who is funded by the people and votes for the people, and is campaigned by the people, who represents the people gets you a democracy

Voting for a plutocrat who is funded by special interests and votes for special interests and is campaigned by bought off media pundits gets you an oglicarchy.

That is the most simple way that I can put it.

When you look at how both candidates run and fund their campaign you can see that a revolution is already taking place where the people are rallying together to take control of our government back from the systematic incredibly corrupt amounts of money pouring into politicians pockets from special interests, to be funneled back into the special interests through political favors or deregulations and with tax payers money.

This is how a democracy turns into an oglicarchy, and this is how the middle class vanishes.

Obama at least was and still is not a plutocrat. He separated his personal wealth from special interests, and managed to get some great things done for the American people, through great resistance, and hard work. Also I will give him some credit that unlike Bush (who irresponsibly rushed us into one of the messiest wars in American history, right before an election cycle) he at least attempted to clean up Bush's foreign policy disasters with minimal casualties (at least it could have certainly been a lot worse.) 

He also voted for some pretty darn unconstitutional things that the people never would have voted for, and this is Bernie Sander's appeal, he will truly represent the middle class, not a systematic, incremental destruction of what makes our style of government the best.

THe scary thing about Hillary, and what makes her absolutely UNQUALIFIED is that she will never do any of the aforementioned things that made Obama not so bad. She has never voted against any war or any bomb, thus aligning herself with the title ""war hawk."" Time and time again she flips her stances, with the people when campaigning, and then with special interests when in office, essentially giving the people the finger. 

She is the very definition of a plutocrat, promising special interests that she will give them leeway and tax exemptions (meaning giving them our hard earned money, see the link below) and in return she gets payed a quarter of a million dollars to do a half an hour speech.

http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/07/emails-show-clinton-intervened-on-behalf-of-tax-avoiding-corporate-crony/

She claims that she is ""in touch with middle class,"" yet she makes more money in a month of speeches than an entire family with an average income could make in they and their childrens entire lifetime. She doesn't drive her own car or buy her own groceries. She has servants do all of that.

She runs out of money for her campaigning, so she uses dark money and Super Pacs, and has fundraisers with 30,000 dinner plates, meanwhile blasting white noise speakers outside in an Orweillian manner so that reporters cannot hear the promises that she makes to her contributors, just like the public can not see the transcripts to her speeches to Goldman Sachs and all of the other big banks that Obama bailed out, and that make her unimaginably rich.

""but that's normal"" you say. ""All politicians do that.""

Well Bernie Sanders doesn't do that

You see, this is what incremental politics give you, apathy. You know it's not morally or ethically correct, but it is ok because it is what we have been accustomed to being exposed to. It is, essentially brainwashing. It is easier to turn on CNN or some other paid off, propaganda piece of mainstream media and say ""let the politicians deal with our problems.""

That is ironic, because in fact they are profiting, and we are paying. We need to take back our government, we need to take back our passion. Democracy is what makes our country great. Hillary Clinton is a terrifying potential president, she is the epitome of ""going too far, past the point of redemption.""

brainwashed,politics,Trump Clinton Dons Hillary's Tu-Tu,"Hillary Clinton is getting way too little attention, and is evading the media's attempts to know her platform completely.

They, the people who think they control the DNC, created this solution over years -- even decades-- by using the mass media to carefully (or not so carefully) cultivate a group of simple, good Americans and morph them into human beings woefully misinformed, highly emotionalized and ultimately simplistic and naive in their political understanding of their nation's political universe and it's place in the world. the most visible incarnation being r/politics, but there are herds more people out there who could easily be drawn into that niche market.

This is a very dangerous situation, like a tinderbox ready for a spark, a tinderbox placed in the middle of a gasoline depot. Because when someone with political star-power and enough access to financial resources arrives on the scene, all that person has to do is repeat the magical trigger phrases that these people have been conditioned to respond to, and as far as they are concerned, they have found their Chosen One. Especially when combined with money, fame, and power-- the things that Americans are so very intensely programmed to love and respect--control is so very easily hijacked. And thus this well-intentioned but brainwashed audience can be usurped, used as a ready-made political foundation to launch what, by the poll numbers anyway, appears to be a seriously viable political campaign for the Presidency of the United States.

The twisted irony is that Hillary herself is a victim of this long term attempt by people who largely control the DNC and who flood the airwaves with horrible hate and political vitriol to mindfuck the American people. She is a true believer of their bullshit. For example, she sincerely believes that her campaigning against Obama's Kenyan heritage is OK. She will, I bet, believe this till the day she dies. She has been caught--hook, line, and sinker-- by the bullshit machine. This assclown most certainly is a Beltway insider who buys a shitload of network TV ads, which entails, as it does for all too many Americans, her relationship with reality. For all her power, fame, and supposed political savvy, she simply doesn't seem to have the mental capacity to discern when she is being served a platter of steaming horseshit, in the political sense. She has the intellectual depth of the average American who didnt give a hoot in high school to know anything beyond what was required to pass the next test in class, and had no desire to remember any of it into the future. Is there anything wrong with that? Not if you are going to spend your life managing a fast food restaurant, work in a retail store, ply an honest trade, or labor at any of the millions of decent respectable jobs in this country. But this is obviously not acceptable if you are going to match wits with extremely intelligent leaders in the world who actually are highly trained, highly educated, and technically sophisticated in ways that the average plumber or seamstress simply does not need to be. The consequences of a mistake are far more serious than whether or not the customer ordered extra fries with that.

So here we have a woman of great power and established influence, but with below average qualifications to be a serious and effective statesperson on the global scene. She obviously is quite proudly a self righteous prick with delusions of grandeur. Brainwashed, silly fool that she is, she knows all the trigger words--the magical incantations, the special code phrases--that make all those who have been similarly programmed, to twitch, jerk, and spasm in endearing support for her. She can set them off across the landscape like a robotic army kneejerking their programmed outrage at petty and questionable crisis and issues all carefully pre-selected and designed to avoid any real systemic change or discussion of solutions that might threaten the status quo of the nation and much of the planet that is largely under its thumb. She knows how to control this monstrously ignorant and misinformed mob of angry citizen-automatons. It comes naturally to her, because she knows in her heart she is predestined to rule them. She has the power to wrest the candidacy from the true will of the people. Another Clinton, of the Clintons.

This wide-eyed scion is caught in the act of trying hard to act respectable, and to appeal to the more intelligent, informed, sophisticated, and less brainwashed of the nations electorate by distancing herself from her Frankenstein past. She can no longer afford to pander to her petting zoo of gullible fearers of Obama, because it will alienate the still far more numerous individuals who can think for themselves and discern the Clinton War Machines antics and vote against her and defeat her.

But Hillary, in all her passionless emotionless demagoging, will have none of that. Her world is black and white, it is clear, simple, and straightforward, and she knows what is what. There are no warm purple spaces, there is no political tolerance. This is the American one only finds now in Wal*Mart commercials. Where there is a product for every want, pain, displeasure, or discomfort. She ""lies"", and the automatons love her for it. It all makes sense to the: Hillary's defensiveness. Even her half baked, rehashed, 1990's ideas. Her silly statements. Her anger and racist and hate-tinged opinions. It makes perfect sense because this is the world they live in. This is what they have read in newspapers and heard on capitol hill, for years, for decades. She repeats for them exactly what they think the big, wide, scary world out there is like. So they grativate to her as their savior, as one who speaks the truth. The one who will lead them to the promised land. Oh god. What a sad, fucking mess.

Hillary Clinton is the Bill-Borne scion who sits atop the Clinton War Machine and attempts to reap its sad, cynical harvest. And she is a hypocrite. She deserves every accusation we can throw at her. I oppose her for her passionlessness-- as sad and pathetic as it is-- but I weep for our country. Her small victory is another sign that there might be an end to our democracy; that there is an advancing tide of hate and ignorance and stupidity, but ultimately that we are very close to a triumph of corruption by the wealthy which is already inch by inch strangling the soul of America.

For all his money, fame and supposed financial savvy, he simply doesn’t seem to have the mental capacity to discern when he is being served a platter of steaming horseshit, in the political sense. He has the intellectual depth of the average American who didn’t give a hoot in high school to know anything beyond what was required to pass the next test in class, and had no desire to remember any of it into the future. Is there anything wrong with that? Not if you are going to spend your life managing a fast food restaurant, work in a retail store, ply an honest trade, or labor at any of the millions of decent respectable jobs in this country. But this is obviously not acceptable if you are going to match wits with extremely intelligent leaders in the world who actually are highly trained, highly educated and technically sophisticated in ways that the average plumber or seamstress simply does not need to be. The consequences of a mistake are far more serious than whether or not the customer ordered extra fries with that. 

So here we have a man with great wealth and established celebrity, but with below average qualifications to be a serious and effective statesman on the global scene. He is obviously and quite proudly a self righteous prick with delusions of grandeur. Brainwashed, silly fool that he is, he knows all the trigger words--the magical incantations, the special code phrases--that make all those who have been similarly programmed, to twitch, jerk and spasm in endearing support for him. He can set them off across the landscape like a robotic army kneejerking their programmed outrage at petty and questionable crisis and issues all carefully pre-selected and designed to avoid any real systemic change or discussion of solutions that might threaten the status quo of the nation and much of the planet that is largely under its thumb.  He knows how to control this monstrously ignorant and misinformed mob of angry citizen-automatons. It comes naturally to him, because he is at heart one of them. He has the power to wrest the candidacy from the preselected scions with more aristocratic backgrounds: another Bush, another clone of Romney, and the collage of sycophantic proteges. 

These wide-eyed scions are caught in the act of trying hard to act respectable, and to appeal to the more intelligent, informed, sophisticated and less brainwashed of the nation’s electorate by distancing themselves from their Frankenstein rabble. They can no longer afford to pander to their petting zoo of gullible lovers of outrage, because it will alienate the still far more numerous individuals who can think for themselves and discern the bullshit machine’s antics and vote against them and defeat them. 

But Donald, in all his fervent emotional pontificating, will have none of that. His world is black and white, it is clear, simple and straightforward and he knows what is what. There are no gray areas, there is no multi-culturalism. This is the America one only finds now in television commercials. Where there is a product for every want, pain, pleasure or discomfort. He “tells it like it is”, and the automatons love him for it. It all makes sense to them: Donald’s outrage. Even his half baked, rehashed, 1990’s ideas. His silly statements. His anger and racist and hate-tinged opinions. It makes perfect sense because this is the world they live in. This is what they have seen on TV and heard on talk radio, for years, for decades. He repeats for them exactly what they think the big, wide, scary world out there is like. So they gravitate to him as their savior, as the one who speaks the truth. The one who will lead them to the promised land. Oh god. What a sad, fucking mess.

Donald Trump points his finger at the high-born scions who sit atop the bullshit machine and attempt to reap its sad, cynical harvest. And he quite rightly accuses them of hypocrisy. They deserve every accusation he can throw at them. I applaud him for his passion--as misguided and moronic as it is--but I weep for our country. His small victory is another sign that there might be an end to our democracy; that there is an advancing tide of hate and ignorance and stupidity, but ultimately that we are very close to a triumph of corruption by the wealthy which is already inch by inch strangling the soul of the United States of America.

brainwashed,politics,Republicans have no integrity. Media + Democracy = Mediocracy,"I feel sorry for all the irrational fact obsessed republicans. There is a difference between fact and truth; facts don't have to be true, I'll explain in a bit. The GOP are taking advantage of generations of people who can't think for themselves because you objectivist hypocrites don't care about public education. You hijacked and demonized democratic education reform just to keep private schools competitive and your flawed christian beliefs intact, then say it wasn't going to work in the first place.

I watched the Republic convention. Do you know how many times education was mentioned? Once. The GOP doesn't have a single care for public education does it? Because they can't teach their religion class?

Congratulations GOP, you actually socially engineered the people you want to mindlessly follow you. 

A lot of republicans don't seem to understand the difference between facts and truths; facts don't have to be true (Like for example, when the economy takes a hit and the price of ice cream goes up and murders also increase, that, actually, does not mean that the price of ice cream is a good way to measure the murder rate.)
So the Republican VP takes after Ayn Rand? The objectivist? Where you care for yourself over others? That also explains the sad state of public education, because why support education if you are already educated? By the way, she was vehemently anti-religion.

Is it just me or are most republicans just not willing to care enough to do their own research? Can't you see the GOP is preying on the type of people who just blindly care only about their own sense of self-entitled morality that isn't even their own! Of course they will appear hypocritical! Their Mormon candidate borrows morals from Christianity, then turns around and goes, ""except for this part, where we put ourselves before anyone else"". I mean seriously, what the exploit! What they are doing!? They are making the same mistakes as the church; they have no idea how transparent their manipulation is, their selective use of metaphors is laughable.

Over and over people have been quoted saying the republican convention feels like its tailored towards people with short attention spans (What else feels that way? television and pop culture come to mind....).

Do any of you republicans here realize how sophist you are? Being sophisticated is an insult to humanity. The GOP is the epitome of sophism. The America I learned about in grade school, the America I was proud to pledge allegiance to, disappeared when I grew up and realized how many lies the church has fed into humanity ever since it became a political tool. Go do some research on the gothic age, that's when the corruption in the church really starts to show. Do you guys just not care about history? Last I checked that's how you repeat it.

This probably isnt the right time to get into federal policy because it isn't ever being discussed, but I feel this is important to my argument against shipping jobs overseas, or trusting regulation for that matter.

Did you know that old non-stick pans are lined with Teflon, if you scratch it and ingest the particulates it can cause birth defects and cancer! Did you know that the FDA actually concealed that information from the public for a few years after they found out, to protect the company? YOU ATE OFF IT, THEY KNEW. Did you know your food is grown on fields polluted with arsenic from the industrial revolution? We polluted our own land using arsenic as a pesticide, it stays in the ground for years and years. Many cities feed water to their citizens that is WAY over the recommended ppm intake established by the CDC.

Non-organic arsenic is a byproduct of burning coal, and heres a nice shocker: In small doses, it can considerably increase your to risk to diabetes and heart disease. It also makes you catch the swine flu more easily.

Did you know in China Corporate Espionage is legal? A company in China made an iPhone5 based off the rumors circulating, and guess what? They are openly planning on suing apple for copyright infringement if Apple tries to release it in China, because they don't want their money to make it back to America.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57506127-71/iphone-5-clone-maker-to-sue-apple-over-um-iphone-5-patent/

Yes this is totally legal in China.

We have NO factories (Ok, we do, but they are nothing compared to china), so obviously, we are going to have a hard time getting started producing state of the art products, especially when China is deliberately limiting their rare metals exports to raise demand, especially when we have to actually pay our workers and treat them fairly, which china does not. Please explain to me how outsourcing our jobs to China will help us. What's going to happen when China gets fed up with our meddling in the Pacific Rim? We just sent 60% of our Naval forces there. They will stop stocking our walmarts and grocery stores. How are you ok with reliance like that????

Healthcare is getting to the point where you can replace parts of yourself with something that could be considered more useful. How are they going to moderate this? In this capitalist driven economy, why would health insurance companies even try to cater towards the poor, when the ultra-rich are so close to immortality and pay for their care straight out of pocket without insurance? 

I hear stories all the time about how drug companies will stop producing medications with expired patents, so they tweak the drug, and only give the FDA the paperwork on the trials that gave results they wanted. Were you there when that whole debacle about the effectiveness of depression medication happened? Health care IS affordable, but who in their right mind wants to make something affordable when you can profit from it? This is the main difference I see between Mitt and Obama. Except Obama is openly admitting he is trying to make life better for everyone and Mitt hides his success, when he should be embracing it.

Want an example of the fucked up healthcare right now?

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9508895/A-virus-that-kills-cancer-the-cure-thats-waiting-in-the-coldc.html

No one is touching that promising UNIVERSAL cure for cancerous tumors because the scientists thought they would be doing more good by publicly patenting it. All it did was isolate them, because no one can make money on it. So why bother researching it?

I honestly have no preference for either side. I value integrity, and I really don't see any integrity from the Republicans. However, Obama is struggling to redefine morality, and all the wacko patriot religious extremists are starting to come up with their own little cute definitions completely detached from reality. You are letting the republicans troll the democrats, congrats. You should have faith in humanity. You should have faith in yourself. Are you so brainwashed by relying on religion to think for you that you are unable to accept responsibility for yourself? Everyone uses Religion as an excuse to stop thinking. Philosophy is dead and republicans are the proof.

Capitalism is not the answer. DIY and open-source companies are the future. Get with the program!

brainwashed,politics,To people concerned about money in politics,"I would like to talk seriously about the concept that ""money buys elections"" in the United States, or the various corollaries of this theory: ""Victory is determined by fundraising"", ""Elections are for sale"", and so forth.  I feel that these ideas are directly contrary to the experiences we have every day, and need re-examining.

The other day, I was in a pub and I saw a commercial from Americans For Prosperity come on the TV, talking about the dangers of Obamacare.  Now, I happen to know who Americans For Prosperity are, but even if I didn't, it wasn't hard to see they were a conservative activist group of some kind.  I paid about as much attention to it as I did the beer commercial that came on right before, and then got back to watching the game.

I'm sure we all react this way when a political commercial comes on the TV.  I didn't change my vote based on the half-heard mumblings in that commercial.  Has anyone reading this ever changed their vote based on a TV commercial?  Do you have any friends who have?  In fact, if the person next to me at the pub had said, ""You know, I didn't have any opinions before seeing that commercial, but now, I'm voting for Romney"", I would never have believed he was serious.  That doesn't sound like something real people say.

Comparing it to the beer commercial I saw before it, nobody in the history of the world has ever said, ""I don't drink, but that Coors Light commercial has convinced me to drink my first beer.""  What people *do* say is, ""I'm drinking Michelob Ultra, but I guess I could try a Bud Select after this.""  (For those who don't know, these are two low-calorie beers that both taste like water).  In other words, we all have an inherent understanding that commercials don't create new loyalties, they subtly shift them between similar brands.  So honestly, the next time you worry about the brainwashing effects of political ads, remember this: We've had beer commercials for a long time now, and neither you nor I know anyone who's been turned into an alcoholic because of beer commercials.

Every day, I hear from some douchebag liberal how Republicans are destroying this country, and I'm tired of it.  For ever believing anything ALL THE NEWS PAPERS REPORT, I'm called stupid or uninformed, when really I think liberals are a bunch of idealistic kids who don't know how the world works.

I'm going to tell you why I'm a Republican, and I'd like to see FACTS -- actual records from THOMAS or other PROOF that I'm wrong.  This is your chance.  If the whole world is wrong, and you liberals are right, prove it.

1.  Obama and the democrats want to hand out my tax money to people too lazy to work for themselves, and I won't have it.  

2.  We WORK for what we get in this country.  You don't work, you get nothing, you whine.  There is no reason a lazy generation of new hippies can't get off their lazy, fat butts and get a job.

3.  I don't want to be forced to have the healthcare Obama says I have to.  I have health insurance from my employer.  Why do I need him to take my money against my wishes and force me to buy the insurance he thinks I should have?

4.  Obama tried to go to war with Libya without the approval of Congress, which is illegal.

5.  Obama gave weapons to Mexican drugs lords, which is illegal.

6.  Obama is a Muslim, and Muslims want to destroy America.

7.  Democrats want to downsize our military.  Republicans are the only ones trying to defend this country.

8.  Everyone has freedom of religion, sure, but Democrats want to make it illegal to pray, to talk about God, to post anything about God.  If a small community of CHRISTIANS want the 10 commandments in their courthouse, then by God, they have the right as a community to do it.  We are a CHRISTIAN nation!

9.  Democrats want to kill babies to reduce the population.  That's why they keep supporting despicable things like abortion.

10. Democrats want to take all the good jobs and give them away to people based just on their skin color using Affirmative Action.

11. Obama has been making secret deals with Russia.

12. The Democrats ran a man who is not even an American!  Obama is not a born citizen of the United States of America.

13. Democrats want to brainwash our children to be atheists by forcing them to accept things like evolution and not allowing them to hear the TRUTH.

14. The Democrats are not willing to do what it takes to fight the terrorists, and even want to let them go from GITMO so they can attack us some more.

15. The Republicans keep trying to give businesses the money they need to make jobs, but the Democrats keep stopping them, so there are no jobs and they blame the Republicans for it.

So, there it is.  I hear all the time about how everything in the news is a lie and all Republicans do is lie, and nobody proves anything.  Nobody cites anything, and when I google MY views, I only see that I am right.  So, I double dare you to convert me with proof and facts with proof and not just douchey liberal lies.

If I said the Bible says breathing is evil are you going to believe me?

If I said doing sex in the bedroom is evil are you going to believe me?

Are you dizzy with illogical poison flowing in your head after reading this?  

What if the person who wrote the bible put in the clause that eating is evil, or owning a computer is evil?  

You heard what the new author of the bible said, he jus darn tol'd me that eatin is unabashedly sinful.  So be a good bible thumper and clean out that fridge, clean it out, take out every yummy morsel of meat youghurt, everything that's nutritious and give all that food to us, I mean, to the church.

Hey, HEY put that fucking burger down, don't you go around flaunting Jesus's laws sinner!  Now you're a fucking sinner, you're going to buy yourself a one way ticket to that burning abyss

Okay, good, now memorize it so that you can follow some beautiful biblical rules.  This will help you strenghthen your new faith

Not while you're sitting you can not do anything sitting down, we just said sitting is sinful, look idiot it's in the book, I wrote it down a few moments ago, and if it's inside a book that is also called a bible, its real.  

So no sitting okay? Like lay on your side, or lay on your chest, stand on one leg, you may use two legs and feet if you so desire, you may stand for hours if you so please.

But sitting on your butt is s no-no.  That's the new sin, we're going to make laws about that, and there should be some new fines too.  


typing is a sin, now, now, unless you're typing with a priest watching your hand, now then that's okay.  But typing alone in your room without sepervision is never allowed.  You're so lucky that Jesus is taking all yor sins away with all that typin that's going on in yur dirty hands with that dirty little mind of yurs, he might not be so nice next time.

Driving is not allowed, driving is showing arrogance to Jesus.  It's showing that you are faster than Jesus and that's pure unacceptable.  If you're gunna, you better be driving that monstrosity of yours backwards.  That way, the church will be satisfied that you're not offending the scriptures of our lord Jesus Christ.

And don't go asking who or why someone wrote this bible, just follow whatever sins is written in a book , you're lucky we're allowing youse to read.  We ancient author woul've made reading a sin, but then nobody will brainwashed by our writing.

And get angry whenever someone is askin all those questios, act angry and tell them to follow what you follow, make up some arguments, and validate it with logikal equivalants, drawings and threats, and that'll strenghthen them faith in the blessed almighty above.

So if you see someone driving, eating, breathing, or jus plian sittin' on their beehind, then point your finger, blame them, act angry (who am I kidding you're going to be angy as hell, cus you haven't eaten in a while, the last time you sat was when you were four yrs old, and man when nobody's looking you sneak in a breath every now and then.) and call them sinners.  So get noodles cranking with some nice circular reasoning and faith-based logic with spiffy rebuttals and demand that people stop sitting, driving, breathing, and eating.  

Man doesn't it feel good not to think for the moment, but, instead, to always think about fifty to sixty years later, and always set your present thinking in the afterlife?  Now that you're following these few laws you know you'll be safe in a hundred years.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/r5a2u/if_this_is_not_a_free_country_then_the_senators/,1332262382.0,r5a2u

brainwashed,politics,Have no hope. Political change is for morons.,"There's been talk of ""revolutions"" lately on some of the threads. I'm here to explain why people who say that are morons.

WARNING : this will be long, there is no tldr, and my grammar is not perfect.

Since the invention of agriculture, and especially in the last few thousand years, there has been two groups of people.

1) Winners and victims

There are winners, and there are victims. Winners are the rich, and the victims are the poor. Naturally, the victims outnumber the winners 1000 to 1.

Examples of this are the roman emperors, kings, and lately, the government, billionaires and the bank. I do not believe there has been one civilization where everyone has been equal. Disparity in wealth has always existed.

We, my friend, are victims. We are not rich, we have no influence, and we are unhappy. But that's okay, that's why we want a revolution.

But what on earth is a revolution? There are some people who are angry that their own personal views are not being addressed. That is not wanting a revolution, that is wanting to turn from a victim to a winner. There are those who speak of ideals like ""fraternity, equality, freedom, equal representation."" Ideals which really haven't existed in human civilization. Those are people who want a revolution (a small percentage of people)

A revolution would mean overthrowing everyone in power, the banks, the oil companies, McDonalds, everything. Everyone who is fucking the little guy in the ass. A new type of government.

2) A new government

You want a revolution so that everyone could be equal? That sounds like communism. We know how that turned out.

You want a group that tries to take down the current government? That's called terrorism. Patriots don't like terrorism.

It would be almost too easy to brainwash soldiers into believing that us ""revolutionaries"" are in fact anti-democratic terrorists. Once that's done, they will marshal law our leaders and take us to prison.

3) We cannot win

We simply cannot win. The government keeps us alive for slave labor, while slowly poisoning us with bad food and bad water. Our time, our precious lives, are put into the system. We get the money, which keeps us alive, and have a few creature comforts. As long as we are dependent on money, we cannot overrule the government.

It's simple, revolutionaries need money. The government and banks have it. You think they will lend us money so we can put them out of power??!?!

They control the heating, the water, the electricity, and the oil. The winners keep us alive, so we can work. 

It doesn't matter who wins the elections, the rich will get richer. Us victims will stay poor.

4) Hope and fear.

Humans can be ruled by two things. Hope and fear. 

Democracy runs on hope. Communism runs on fear. Religion runs on both (tis a beautiful thing religion)

You want to gather all the victims to revolt. 50% will hope that the next politician will be better. 49% will be too fearful to do anything. 

Objectively speaking, the government has set up a beautiful system that ensures an iron fist over us all. 

5) Evolution at work

In evolution, there will always be winner and losers. In society, there will always be the rich and the poor. The rich can bully the poor, because THEY CAN.

The only thing anyone can do is try to turn themselves from victim to winner. There can never be equality. Political change is a facade. When the french got rid of their king, the bankers and politicians became king. 

6) In conclusion, political change is near impossible. If it does happen, there it will simply be a new group of winners, and a new group of victims. I encourage everyone who speak of revolutions to reply with a scenario in which a revolution succeeds, and the world is turned for the better. It is easy to be upset at the present, but do you have a plan for the future?

If a revolution ever does occur, and I'm wrong, and there is a change of us victims winning. I will join it. I will mercilessly climb to the top of it. Then I will purge those who disagree with me, and rule the new government with an iron fist. Only the ruthless makes it to the top. And those on top don't give a fuck about you and I.

brainwashed,politics,My letter to the White House on President Obama's signing of the NDAA.,"President Obama's signing of the National Defense Authorization Act with its provision for arresting American citizens without a charge and keeping them in indefinite detention has finally, completely, and utterly destroyed my faith in America's political system and has converted a lifelong Democrat into a lifelong non-voter. 

How a former professor of Constitutional law could not only sign, but request the insertion of this provision, has left me beyond flabbergasted. How a supposed champion of civil liberties could, before the entire world, cede himself and future presidents the power to make American citizens 'disappear' without the petty nuisance of due process--a step not even George W. Bush took--in the name of a phony, trumped up 'war on terror' is such a nightmarishly Orwellian act that it leaves me no choice but to believe that either power corrupts absolutely and instantaneously or that some of the wilder conspiracy theories on the internet are true (including those involving aliens, brainwashing, and secret cabals dating back thousands of years). 

For the time being, I'll stick with the former assumption, given my respect for reason and Occam's Razor. 

In any case, the mantra of Democratic candidates has, for as long as I can remember, been: 'There's no need to cater to the liberal wing of the party. They'll vote for us no matter what.' 

Well, I hope the parasites who make their livings analyzing and manipulating voters are bright enough to realize that beyond a certain point, liberals will simply stop voting altogether. President Obama has pushed me beyond that point.

Finally, though I am by no means a Libertarian, a growing number of young voters are (apparently unaware that stripping the government of power places it into the hands of multinational corporations), and your defilement of the U.S. Constitution has given them a powerful argument for distrusting you and their government, as you will see if you visit the link below:

Assuming you ever were an idealist as a young man, how would that young man feel about the crime against civil liberties you have just perpetrated against the American people? I think he too would consider the possibility that you had been brainwashed by aliens.

brainwashed,politics,"Wait, isn't Ron Paul anti-capitalist..?","So, today in one of my Political Science courses, a fellow student started preaching Ron Paul 2012 in the middle of class, and mentioned the gold standard as a means of fixing inflation.

Then I started thinking to myself; Why is this man desiring to set back the U.S economy to the stone age with commodity money? This would limit economic growth, a basic principle in capitalism and seeing as how Ron Paul wants us to be a laissez-faire state (free-market), isn't this a contradictory policy of his?

I'm in no way against RP, I just want to understand. Also, I'm sick of all these Paulbertarians preaching Ron Paul like he's some hero. You know what's thats called? Brainwashing. Yeah, just like you guys complain that the media is brainwashing the American people to go against Ron Paul, the youth is being a little too influenced by him. 

Someone change my opinion on this, back this up, or straight up refute this. Help me understand, thanks.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o4c5m/wait_isnt_ron_paul_anticapitalist/,1325792953.0,o4c5m
brainwashed,politics,"The GOP Should Be Thrown in Prison for Dereliction of Duty
","I recall reading or hearing that the number one priority of the Republican Party is to ensure President Obama serves only one term. I recognize the fact that the party out of power will attempt to oust the other, but to make it the most important mission borders on insanity. 

In what part of the constitution can that assertion be justified? I always thought the primary mission of the congress was to ensure the people's business was taken care of. I guess one could say that getting rid of him would be in the best interest of the people. 

However, that assertion does not pass the smell test, because he was elected by a clear majority of the people. It should be noted that the republicans made this very clear from the very beginning. It wasn't base on whether he had done sometime wrong, but rather on their personal contempt for him. 

Anyone with any reasonable intelligence can see they are going full throttle to ensure his downfall. Their actions are a clear indication that they will pursue their objective regardless of how it may adversely affect our country. It seems to me that they are hovering very near treason. 

It defies logic to rob the poor and give to the rich. Whenever I hear of their positions in such matters, I think of Robin Hood of Sherwood forest. While the noblemen enjoyed all of their privileges, the poor were left to fight over the crumbs from their table. 

Most anyone should be able to see the same scenario occurring in this country. Data has clearly shown that the rich are getting richer while the poor are becoming poorer. 

Even the Supreme Court has ruled that the wealthy can contribute unlimited amounts to their candidate. With this being a fact, just who do you think will be better represented? I really hope you didn't say the poor. When have you ever heard of lobbyist courting the poor? You are no good to them because you have no money. 

Rich man equals master. Poor man equals slave. I have never in all of my years heard of the rich man catering to a poor man. We see it all around us, the poor being demonized and called all sorts of names. The standard argument seems to be that they are lazy and don't want to work. They never stop and tell you that many of the so-called jobs have been sent overseas. 

Come election time I as well as you know who the politicians will cozy up to. You can bet it will not be the poor, because they can't do anything for them. So, they cozy up to the wealthy and if they want their money, they must agree to pursue their agenda. Where does that leave the poor? I think you have the answer to that one and it doesn't require rocket science. 

Stop and think for a moment, in this coming presidential election it is projected that over a billion dollars will be spent. A billion dollars! 

Inasmuch as the agenda for the wealthiest among us is being pursued, the rest of us will slowly drown. 

However, we the poor can turn this whole thing around if only we cooperate and stop being brainwashed by the minority. 

Inasmuch as the republicans only represent the minority, they are in violation of the constitution and should be either impeached or thrown in prison. Moreover, while they say we are lazy, they are actually taking our money for doing nothing. They have the best benefits. 

Their refusal to take care of the peoples' business in good faith makes them the laziest of them all.

brainwashed,politics,In honor of Bill of Rights day..,"Greetings, American citizens!  In honor of the 220th birthday of our Bill of Rights, we thought this would be an excellent time to explain exactly what that document is all about.  Despite our best efforts there is a good chance that you may have heard a bit about the Bill of Rights recently, and we wanted to help to clear up any confusion you might have.

The Bill of Rights is the collective name for the first ten amendments to our constitution.  Believe it or not, very few Americans can even name them all – much less understand them.  We are currently working hard to make them much easier to remember by removing some of the more tedious “rights”, but in the meantime we felt it would be helpful to provide you with this helpful explanation of just what these ten amendments really say.

The First Amendment provides four basic things: freedom of religion, speech, the press, and assembly.  Sadly, terrorists have spread lies about what that really means, so let’s clear things up!

•	Freedom of Religion: Who even knows what that means?  You guys should probably fight amongst yourselves over that.  Remember, if your neighbor doesn’t have the exact same beliefs about God as you do, he’s your enemy and should not be trusted!

•	Freedom of speech: Basically, this protects the rights of the wealthy to trade money to elected representatives in exchange for favorable legislation.  Over the years we have generously expanded this to allow actual people to speak their minds, but there are limits!  For example, the first amendment does not protect dangerous speech such as shouting “fire!” in a crowded theater or speaking against the government.

•	Freedom of the press: This means that the government will do nothing to hinder the press in relaying our message to the people – as long as the press is relaying the correct message.  For obvious reasons, we reserve the right to deny the press access to any event where the government might be portrayed in a negative light.  This is necessary to keep the reporters safe from the dangerous ideas that might be expressed by political dissidents.

•	Freedom of assembly: This allows American citizens to gather wherever they choose to express their feelings of gratitude towards the government.  Sadly, terrorists have attempted to pervert this freedom and claim that people are also free to assemble and criticize the government!  Despite this idea being clearly ridiculous, we still permit it provided that the traitorous swine follow some very reasonable guidelines; such as containing their protest to a free speech zone, peacefully accepting beatings and arrest for their dangerous ideas, immediately disbanding in the event that their protest gains any kind of traction, and paying cold hard cash for the right to speak up.

The Second Amendment gives the American people the right to bear arms.  Strangely, many Americans think that we might have a problem with this.  Relax, we’re actually totally fine with it.  The truth is, our guns are way, way bigger than yours anyway.  I mean really, what are you going to do with those pea-shooters, kill off a couple of our low-level enforcers?  Go ahead, those idiots are completely expendable and we can use the incident as justification to clamp down on other more dangerous rights that you might think you might have.

The Third Amendment protects you from being forced to quarter troops.  Weird, huh?  Apparently it was a pretty big deal a couple hundred years ago.  Thanks to our hilariously bloated military budget it’s unlikely that we’ll have to make any changes to this one, but on the off chance that we do, we’re pretty sure they just meant British troops.

The Fourth Amendment protects you from unreasonable search and seizure.  Basically this means that we can’t arrest you and take your stuff without having a damn good reason.  Unless you have illegal drugs.  Or are involved in terrorism.  Or we think that you have drugs or are involved in terrorism.  Or we mistook you for someone that we think had drugs or was involved in terrorism.  In those situations, you’re boned.  

The Fifth Amendment guarantees certain rights to anyone arrested in the United States.  Of all these rights, the most misunderstood is probably the right to due process.  This essentially means that we cannot simply arrest someone and hold them indefinitely without bringing them before a judge to decide if they deserve to lose their freedom – unless of course they’re accused of terrorism.  Now, you may be thinking to yourself “but couldn’t you just accuse anyone of terrorism and thus illegally deprive them of their freedom?”  The answer to that is simple: Terrorism is so incredibly evil that merely questioning our judgment here is dangerously un-American.

The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a public trial by jury if you’re accused of a crime – unless that crime is terrorism, or we don’t have enough evidence to convict you and decide to accuse you of terrorism to free ourselves from the need to prove anything.  The idea was to keep the system honest by making sure all citizens could see what they were doing, but this didn’t take into account that terrorists have super powers like mind-control.  Obviously, if we gave terrorists a public trial they’d take advantage of the situation and use it to brainwash innocent Americans, so this limit is necessary to protect you.

The Seventh Amendment guarantees jury trials in civil lawsuits exceeding a certain dollar amount.  Meh, you guys can have this one.  Hell, sue each other to your hearts’ content, but remember that you’ll need our permission to sue us.

The Eighth Amendment forbids excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishment.  People often get confused about what exactly “cruel and unusual” means, so here’s an easy way to figure out if this amendment is being violated: If we’re doing it, it isn’t cruel or unusual.  In some situations, this may seem strange – for example, in World War II we claimed that waterboarding was torture and even executed people for using it; yet today we claim that waterboarding is a harmless prank.  Some people might claim that this is hypocritical and wrong, but those people are clearly terrorists, and anything they say can be safely discarded.

The Ninth Amendment states that just because a right isn’t listed in the constitution does not necessarily mean that such a right does not exist.  This may at first seem like a very complicated amendment, but it’s actually quite simple: it just means that the government has rights in addition to those listed here.

The Tenth Amendment states that any rights not specifically allowed or denied by the government at the federal level are reserved for the government at the state level.  The actual text has something about “the people”, which can be confusing to some.  You see, back when our constitution was written the phrase “the people” was understood to mean “the ruling class only”.  In other words, this amendment doesn’t affect you at all – best to just forget about it.

freedom,politics,"I’m Stacey Abrams. There are 10 Steps to Autocracy and Authoritarianism. In America, we’re seeing all 10. But there’s still time to fight back. Ask me anything.","Hello Reddit! It’s Stacey Abrams. I'm a tax attorney by trade, a serial entrepreneur, best-selling author, and the former Democratic Leader in the Georgia House. I’ll answer questions about any of that work. But right now, I’m laser-focused on calling out authoritarianism and autocracy in America, and helping people find the tools to fight back.

Autocratic regimes rarely seize power in a single dramatic moment. Instead, they erode democracy in simultaneous steps that overwhelm opposition. This idea comes from Professor [Kim Lane Scheppele](https://substack.com/@kimlanelaw) of Princeton, whose work on authoritarianism has helped me—and so many others—make sense of what we’re seeing. Here are the 10 Steps to Autocracy and Authoritarianism:

1. **Win the Last Fair Election →** Autocrats often rise through elections, then ensure it’s the last truly free one.
2. **Expand Executive Power →** Push presidential authority beyond legal boundaries.
3. **Capture the Other Branches →** Co-opt Congress and neutralize the courts.
4. **Gut the Civil Service →** Remove competent government workers and break government so it doesn’t work.
5. **Install Loyalists →** Fill key posts with people willing to ignore the laws and the needs of the people.
6. **Attack the Media →** Discredit independent journalists and voices and replace them with propaganda.
7. **Scapegoat Communities →** Target immigrants, minorities, and marginalized groups and attack DEI.
8. **Destroy Support Systems →** Undermine institutions that defend rights and educate communities.
9. **Normalize Violence →** Militarize law enforcement and incentivize political violence.
10. **End Democracy Itself →** Manipulate elections and systems to guarantee permanent power.

By understanding the authoritarian playbook, we can better make sense of the news, and respond. And to reclaim our democracy today, we need to meet the 10 Steps to Autocracy and Authoritarianism with the [10 Steps to Freedom and Power](https://10stepscampaign.org/#freedom).

**Text of the statement**

>Today, for the first time in 40 years, the United Nations Security Council convened an Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly under the Uniting for Peace mechanism in response to Russia’s unprovoked, unjustified, and unconscionable war on Ukraine. This extraordinary move by the United Nations demonstrates the extent of global outrage at Russia’s horrific assault on a sovereign neighbor and showcased unprecedented global unity.

>An overwhelming majority of nations around the world condemn Putin’s war. An overwhelming majority of nations recognize that Putin is not only attacking Ukraine, he is attacking the very foundations of global peace and security—and everything the United Nations stands for. And an overwhelming majority of the world recognizes that if we do not stand up to Putin’s Russia, it will only inflict further chaos and aggression on the world. Russia stood isolated, with the support of only four brutal, authoritarian states.

>I commend the Member States of the United Nations for holding this historic session.Today’s vote lays bare Putin’s isolation. It also holds Belarus accountable for its unacceptable involvement in this war.

>The world is rejecting Russia’s lies. We can all see what is happening in Ukraine with our own eyes. Russia is responsible for the devastating abuses of human rights and the international humanitarian crisis that we are watching unfold in Ukraine in real time. There is no room for excuses or equivocation. Russia is to blame.

>The United Nations was founded to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.” As Secretary-General António Guterres said, enough is enough. Together, we must—and we will—hold Russia accountable for its actions. We will demonstrate that freedom always triumphs over tyranny.",956,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/t5f5mw/discussion_thread_white_house_releases_a/,1646269346.0,t5f5mw

[Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill"" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).

media bias,politics,Megathread: White House releases controversial memo on allegations of intelligence abuse,">(AP) — The White House on Friday declassified a partisan and bitterly disputed memo on the Russia investigation, clearing the way for House Republicans to release allegations of what they say is FBI misconduct.

>The move came over the fierce objections of the FBI and Justice Department, which have said the document prepared by Republicans on the House intelligence committee is inaccurate and missing critical context.

>The memo alleges that the FBI abused U.S. government surveillance powers in its investigation into Russian election interference. Trump, who has called the investigation a “witch hunt,” has supported the release of the memo in the apparent hopes that it could help undermine the probe being led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

This is a megathread to discuss the authorization and impending release of the House Intelligence Committees memo authored by Rep. Nunes (R-CA). **Please note that off topic and low effort comments may be automatically removed**

media bias,politics,May 2016 Metathread,"Time for another meta thread, everyone! We've had a big month, we have even bigger months coming, and it's time for our regular mod-subscriber get-together to discuss what's changing, what's not changing, and what could change.

____

#General Stuff

* We got 3.2 million unique visitors in the month of April, accounting for just a hair short of 33 million page views! Whoa! Thanks for making us one of the most popular forums on Reddit, everyone. 

* If you have not yet reviewed our PSA [on shills and civility](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4gp5xv/on_shills_and_civility/), and our very verbose [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_please_be_civil) please take a couple of minutes to do so now. Civility has become a serious issue, and it's one we're taking more seriously than ever.  Please approach each conversation as though you were having it at the dinner table with your etiquette-focused great aunt Meredith.  While we understand that politics can easily strike a nerve and rapidly escalate, instead of firing back quickly, please use the report button instead of escalating the conversation in the wrong direction.

* Our mod /u/pimanac has been working very hard to create and share with you a discussion series on former US Presidents (See parts [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4foiv3/former_us_presidents_discussion_series_part_i/), [II](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4ge7pq/former_us_presidents_discussion_series_part_ii/), [III](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4hhlxi/former_us_presidents_discussion_series_part_iii/), and [IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4ik0gu/former_us_presidents_discussion_series_part_iv/)), which we've been stickying the last 3 weeks. Give them a look, if you haven't already - there's a lot of very interesting info in the OP and analysis in the comments. Have you all been enjoying this? Are discussion series like these the kinds of things you'd be interested in seeing more of?

#Policy Changes

* **Title-only rule (coming soon!)**

The most major news of the day - the moderators, after long discussion and months of community feedback, have decided to implement a much simpler rule for submission titles. We are currently programming a bot, and as soon as the bot is finished, it will automatically enforce a headline-only rule for all submissions to /r/politics (the rule does not go into effect until the bot starts enforcing it). This should cut down on a lot of the trolling, non-representative quotation, and clickbait karma farming you may have seen before. This makes it easier for us, this makes it easier for submitters, and this makes it easy for readers to know that they're interacting with publications rather than biases of other users.


* **Shill accusations**

As you can see in the post linked above, cries of *""You're a SHILL!"" ""No, YOU'RE a shill!""* and *Great job correcting the record!""* have gotten absolutely out of hand lately ([see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4gp5xv/on_shills_and_civility/)). 99.8% of the time, this person is not a shill and discourse is just being hindered. 0.2% of the time, this person *might* be a shill, and instead of yelling about it in public, you need to let us know so we can work with the Reddit admins to take care of them. Unfortunately, what has been happening is that we have been getting hundreds upon hundreds of shill accusations *every single day*. It is overwhelming our modqueue, and it has been against the rules for several months. A slap on the wrist no longer being a tenable policy for us after thousands of warnings and a stickied PSA, we will now meet any public accusations of another user being a shill with a week-long ban. 

We don't want to ban you, and you don't want to be banned, so please - if you suspect a user is participating in bad faith, just modmail us so that we can investigate immediately.


* **Slur removals**


We're cracking down on slurs! You've asked for it for a while, and our queues are overwhelmed with it, so we're taking action. With a trusty banhammer and our beloved janitorbot, we are now disallowing the use of words like ""cunt"" (if you dislike a woman, please explain why instead of using slurs), ""cuck"" (fetishes are allowed, personal attacks are not), and various racial epithets which almost always provoke bitter arguments instead of productive conversations. We hope this will foster an environment for productive discussions and thought-out points instead of pithy one-liners. 

* **Combatting Trolling** 

We've had some serious troll issues lately, and we're swinging back with full force. **IF MOST OF A COMMENT IS BOLDED**,

>#Or if it's formatted with header markdown,

it's going to get removed. If the users making comments like these are trolling, they should be banned. If the users making comments like these are attempting to make their comments stand out, they should instead make interesting and thought-out comments and have their contributions stand out that way.

We've also had issues with people trying to troll by severely abusing our title rules, and using quotes intentionally unrepresentative of articles as a whole. Our title-only rule as stated above is going to fix a lot of this when the bot is up and running, but in the meantime, please report any cases of this that you see to us. These users will be immediately banned.

* **Megathreads**

We talked about this in last month's meta thread, but now it's started occurring and we've had some conversation about it it's time to talk about it even more. In case you haven't heard - we're doing megathreads now! Neat! This has been one of our most-requested features for a very long time now, and after months and months spent deliberating on a good way to implement this, we think we've finally found the best possible solution. In the future, when the moderators see incoming stories that we believe will overwhelm the front page or otherwise take over new submissions (think ""major candidate drops out"" or ""congress declares war""), instead of allowing 12 similar things on our front page at once or selecting a single article to give a mod blessing to, what we're going to be doing is creating (and often stickying) a mod-distinguished self-post to act as a megathread. One of our talented programmers is currently working on a bot that will take relevant articles and put them into the OP of that self post so that they're all visible and easy for you to find. Hop into the megathread, have discussions, and find an easily condensed list of many different takes on a story without being bogged down by an overwhelming front page!

* **Self-Post Saturday**

/r/Politics will be temporarily suspending our self-post Saturday tradition until after the presidential election. We value the ability for all of our subscribers to talk, get answers, and discuss what's on their mind - but for the time being, we think the best place for that is going to be in relevant article comments, or in the focused political subreddit of their choice (see our [related subreddits list](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/relatedsubs) to find something that appeals to you!).

We'd been seeing an influx of highly vitriolic and opinionated self-posts reaching the front page, each garnering an overwhelming volume of reports and problematic comments. As part of our desire to make /r/politics accessible and appealing to people from every side of the aisle as well as keep this a place for *civil* discourse, we'd like to keep negative feelings directed towards off-site opinions rather than /r/politics users. We feel that between this, our title-only rule, and our megathreads, you should start seeing a significant difference on the front page in terms of more balanced content. 


* **Bot Removals**

With the *insane* influx of activity lately (3.2 million unique visitors in April), we have been doing the best we can to keep this sub clean - but we need to prioritize what's important. On the majority of days this consists of the front page, current comments in front page threads, and megathreads.

For now, we are implementing a bot to help us deal with some old threads such that our attention can go where it is most sorely needed. We will now be having a bot remove unreviewed posts that are at 0 points or fewer when they are 6 hours old. Our hope is that this can get many of the blatantly rule-breaking and trolling things out of sight so that both we and you all can focus on productive discussion here in /r/politics.

If you see a submission that has been auto-removed by a bot (it'll have a ""bot removal"" flair) and you'd like us to take a look at it, just shoot us a modmail and we'll be glad to approve it if it breaks no rules.

#FAQs

* **""Why don't you ban [Salon/Breitbart/source I don't like]?""**

Some want opinionated sources banned to favor more ""objective"" media outlets. Generally, this boils down to wanting content to align more closely with their preferences. We evaluate sources regularly for spam and blog platform violations, but beyond that, we allow multiple opinions and levels of journalism skill. Please use your votes to determine what goes to the front page.

* **""Are the mods showing bias towards [candidate I don't like]?""**

Some think moderation in /r/politics is slanted to favor political views opposed to theirs. The [Halo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) accounts for why those of different vantage points feel that way. We have moderators who support Paul, Sanders, Johnson, Stein, Trump and Clinton, mods who hate everyone running, and several foreign moderators who don't even have a dog in this race. We're all brought together by our passion for moderation and our love of working together to make communities better. When reviewing an article for our black and white rules, our personal feelings aren't relevant.

* **""What do you do about vote manipulation?""**

We work with the Reddit admins to crack down on any cases of vote manipulation that we find, as that's solidly against Reddit's terms of service and unacceptable in /r/politics. If you find any evidence of vote manipulation, or even more importantly a brigade coming from elsewhere, please modmail us so that we can take an urgent look into it and work with the admins to sort everything out ASAP.

* **""Why isn't the front page more diverse?""**

Some think moderators should do something to ""balance"" submissions so other views break out of /r/politics/new. [Voting maters](http://mic.com/articles/125344/if-anyone-ever-tells-you-your-vote-doesn-t-matter-show-them-this). Not voting entrenches that those who care strongly enough to vote get to set the agenda. As you can see, we've been experimenting with our megathread program to cut down on a lot of duplicate stories that may overtake our front page. Beyond that, the things that reach the front page are determined by voting patterns - and those are things we the moderators have no ability to control. If you'd like to see different content, please submit and vote accordingly.

* **""What do you do about actual shills?""**

We nuke them from orbit.

The moderators here work in tandem with site administrators and users like you to detect paid users participating in bad faith. This is not an easy undertaking - but if they are found they are permanently banned from /r/politics, and reported to the admins so they may be punished at a sitewide level too.

To make things unequivocally clear: if you are here because you're being paid to be here, you are not welcome. Please spare everyone a headache by directing your attention elsewhere.

And that's all for now! If there's anything that you really like, anything you think we could do better, or any changes you'd like to see in the future, let us know below! If you have any cool gifs of sea lions, feel free to put those down there too! Several moderators will be happy to discuss things with you in the comments, and the more respectful you are and the more constructive your criticism, the better a conversation we're likely to have.

media bias,politics,Debunking common myths/disinformation in this election cycle.,"I picked these because they're easily falsifiable and extremely tenaciously spread around.

##1. Bernie's a socialist. 

When the media have called him this he corrects them saying ""democratic socialist"". When Bernie explains what he means by ""democratic socialism"" he describes ""social democratic"" countries with strong welfare/social safety net programs and strong regulations. ""Democratic socialism"" and ""social democracy"" are similar but different. 

Here's Bernie explaining what he means by democratic socialism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFAq-4Vv5c0 – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7jlAZSGXf4 

Here's more [throughout his political career, and the media pinning the title on him](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/14-things-bernie-sanders-has-said-about-socialism-120265).

Bernie points to countries like Denmark, which are top rated by the right-wing Heritage Foundation for economic freedom: http://www.heritage.org/index/country/denmark – http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/opinion/something-not-rotten-in-denmark.html

Social Democracy is a centrist political ideology that is a mix between pure capitalism and socialism. It tries to take the best of both. Pretty much every developed country (including the USA) is a social democracy. Going by the universal political spectrum and/or other 1st world countries, Bernie is a centrist.

The universal political spectrum looks something like this: 

anarchy | communism | socialism | social democracy/mixed economy | capitalism | propertarianism | anarchy
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----

^^You ^^might ^^switch ^^out ^^propertarianism's ^^spot ^^for ^^fascism.

Was the US a socialist nation in the mid 1900's when we had [top tax rates of 70-90%](https://www.savantcapital.com/blog/tax-rates-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow) along with [public higher ed](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/feb/09/bernie-s/was-college-once-free-united-states-and-it-oversea) and [stronger welfare programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act)?

##2. Bernie's an extremist, dreamer, or ""falsely optimistic idiot"". 

Sanders has been running on a platform of public education, universal healthcare coverage, getting money out of politics, and addressing global warming. None of these are extremist positions, and [polls show that the majority of Americans agree with him](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/27/noam_chomsky_bernie_sanders_is_not). Virtually everything Bernie is advocating for has been the norm in other developed countries for decades. 

And I've never once even heard him mention welfare. So the ""free shit"" and ""handouts"" arguments are baseless.

The US has drifted so far to the right that centrist policies and even right-wing policies touted by famous right-wing economists (see #10.4) are called socialist and communist. 

##3. The nordics can afford these things because they have much fewer people. 

This is one of the dumbest ones I've seen. I feel like this usually comes from people purposely trying to spread disinformation.

1. They never give a reason why they think the programs couldn't scale to larger populations.
2. When you buy in bulk the per-unit cost gets cheaper. So not only does it scale, but it's actually better to have a larger population. 
3. It gives you more leverage when negotiating things like drug prices. Access to a market as big as the US is extremely important. 
4. Germany has 80 million people in comparison to Norway's 5 million, and Germany's doing just fine with very similar programs.

##4. We can't afford these things. Other countries can because they're much richer. 

The US is smack dab in the middle of all the other countries that provide the programs we don't: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita 

Our healthcare system is extremely inefficient. [Single payer would be much cheaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxKArchive/comments/4hxj82/politics/d2t7vbe). We already [pay as much of our GDP \(as a percentage\) towards government healthcare \(medicare, medicaid\) as do other countries with top ranking systems that cover the entire population](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1oz3wc/privatization_benefits_the_1_while_public/ccx3ds5).  

##5. The nordics can have these programs because their populations are homogenous. 

I'm not even sure what these people are trying to argue... That minorities are somehow inferior? That white people don't want to see welfare benefits going to minorities? That we have too many immigrants that would ""suck the welfare tit dry""?

Either way [Canada has proportionally more immigrants than us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_immigrant_population) yet they have universal healthcare and real welfare: http://i.imgur.com/cgJDhFb.png – http://www.emploiquebec.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/fichiers/pdf/Publications/SR_dep_montant_prestations_en.pdf – http://www.caledoninst.org/Publications/PDF/1031ENG.pdf

There's merit to the racism claim though: http://billmoyers.com/2014/05/12/how-bill-clintons-welfare-reform-created-a-system-rife-with-racial-biases/ – https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/3qs6ug/colin_powell_i_will_continue_to_be_a_republican/cwi7rs1 

Regarding immigrants being a burden, [there are studies supporting both sides of the argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxKArchive/comments/4hxj82/politics/d2teh6q).

##6. Greece is a good example of why these policies won't work.

[Greece is marred by a culture of corruption, tax evasion, and nepotism](http://www.thenation.com/article/whats-wrong-and-right-about-greece). 

Economist Joseph Stiglitz: [The forced Austerity predictably made Greece's debt crisis worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knbpTydM4Fk&t=150). 

More appropriate countries to use for comparison are Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Nordics. [These countries with the strongest welfare programs & regulations are the ones that were the least affected by the economic crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr3LPFh8CsM). 


##7. Our taxes are high.

[The US is one of the lowest taxed OECD countries](http://www.vox.com/cards/federal-taxes-explained/american-taxes-are-high-or-low-international-context).

Our taxes have been [plummeting ever since Reagan came in](https://www.savantcapital.com/blog/tax-rates-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow/) with his ""Reaganomics"", also known as ""cutting taxes on the job creators"", ""trickle down economics"", etc.. 

Trickle-down/Reaganomics has been disproved multiple times: http://www.neontommy.com/news/2012/11/congressional-research-service-disproves-trickle-down-economics – http://www.businessinsider.com/rich-people-create-jobs-2013-11 

##8. We have welfare in this country.

We do not have general welfare for able, working-age adults. 

We have temporary welfare for new mothers (TANF), and we have a number of specific programs that target some specific people. We have EITC, which is a tax refund (which means you have to have worked & paid taxes). Some people can get unemployment insurance but it's [very limited in multiple ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits#United_States).  

We have food stamps/SNAP, which (beyond a 3 month limit) you have to be working to receive. And we have things like electricity discounts for people who qualify for SNAP. 

We have subsidized housing where you pay 30-40% of your income towards rent. You can get this through section 8 vouchers which are typically only available to apply for once a year or once every few years, and there's a window of about 1 week where you're able to apply, and after you apply the wait might be another year or longer. You can also get subsidized housing through public housing. The waits for these are typically between 1 and 5 years. They're often pretty terrible places to live.

##9. People who want higher taxes to pay for welfare/social safety nets are leaches. 

This is a myopic view that fails to see/address things on a systemic level. It's a view that only sees ""me vs you"" and fails to take into account the affects that political/economic policy has on a society/system [[1](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674430006)], [[2](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/its-official-benefits-and-high-taxes-make-us-all-richer-while-inequality-takes-a-hammer-to-a-9914941.html)], [[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxKArchive/comments/4hxj82/politics/d2t7pi8)], [[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEP2H3QsII&t=12m2s)]. Things like [crime, the affects of the overall education level of citizens, health, etc](http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/plymouth_fairness_inequality.pdf).. 

1. [There are lots of low paying jobs](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/23/low-paying-jobs_n_5868350.html) that must be filled by someone. Union busting lowered the pay of these jobs even more: http://i.imgur.com/6wJ7GS0.jpg – http://www.epi.org/files/charts/img/4127.png 
2. Economists agree that automation & free trade are contributing to economic inequality and must be offset by strong welfare/social safety net programs. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/opinion/trade-labor-and-politics.html – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84NwddpO_0c 
3. Right wing economists like Milton Friedman and Adam Smith acknowledged the problems with pure capitalism and thus advocated for redistribution policies. Friedman was in favor of a Negative Income Tax (NIT), and Adam Smith (founder of capitalism) said you need a social floor to curb market variations. 
4. There are tons of problems that could never be solved without adequate government funding, which is why no developed nation is right-libertarian or even pure capitalist.

##10. Trump's policies will make America great again.

Trump [used to be very different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcUCLwWCihE), but has now adopted most of the Republican party's policies.

It's fairly easy to look back on data and policy changes and see that when America was at it's greatest during the mid 1900's it was a period where we had the [highest taxes in our history](https://www.savantcapital.com/blog/tax-rates-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow/), [we had stronger regulations on Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Legislation), [union membership was higher](http://i.imgur.com/6wJ7GS0.jpg), [we had publicly funded higher education](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/feb/09/bernie-s/was-college-once-free-united-states-and-it-oversea/), etc. etc.. [Democrats also create more jobs](http://politicsthatwork.com/democrats-create-more-jobs.php), and [the economy does better under Democrats](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/opinion/partisan-growth-gaps.html). This is not surprising given the [GOP's disregard of facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxKArchive/comments/4hxj82/politics/d2vmw5o).

We now also have real life results of full blown republican economic policies, and the results are not pretty.

Republicans are the party of the 1%. They constantly fight to [privatize](http://thecontributor.com/public-beats-private-six-reasons-why) and cut social services spending/funding. [Every single GOP candidate for president had a tax policy that cut taxes on the wealthy](http://www.vox.com/2016/2/25/11110526/gop-tax-plans). [Only 1 out of the top 15 biggest 2016 donors gives to liberals](http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?disp=D). 

All the evidence points to republican/neoliberal policies being the cause of the declines, and Bernie's (New Deal Democrat) policies contributing to our previous greatness. 

Trump has the rhetoric but Bernie has the policies.

##11. Both parties are just as bad.

On most of the big issues [they are polar opposites](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2kaubu/just_a_reminder_of_what_the_senate_was_doing_the/cljns3q).

""The other guy is just as bad"" rhetoric benefits the party most at fault.


##So why can't we have these programs in the USA?

People keep voting against it. It's that simple. People see politicians promising ""lower taxes"" and see a direct benefit for themselves, but no democrat or republican politician ever seems to talk about [the consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxKArchive/comments/4hxj82/politics/d2t7pi8). One reason is that ""pro-tax"" is complex and difficult to fit into an appealing soundbite.

What it comes down to is that our education system is a total joke where there is no standardization or federal requirements for things like [science](http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/alabama_will_require_students.html), [civics](http://ktar.com/story/92126/arizona-lawmakers-push-for-mandatory-civics-test-in-high-schools), etc., which means people aren't taught the difference between socialism, communism, capitalism, mixed economies, etc., or even how our government works and what it currently does and does not do. And thus people are extremely susceptible to disinformation & hearsay. This is a HUGE problem in a democratic society since democracy only works if the public is well educated & informed. 

Probably in due large part to those problems we also have extremely low voter turnout which plays a big role in the fact that [the people who donate the most to politicians get all the influence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig).

media bias,politics,I'm so sick of the biased media!,"Seriously, how long do we have to put up with the media just letting Bernie Sanders spout unrealistic policy without being challenged or questioned about it? The media is supposed to be the fourth estate - yet they aren't do anything to help the public understand Bernie's policies and ideas, and the fact that they wouldn't be passed by Congress or sufficiently funded. 

I propose that we, as citizens of the United States, refuse to accept the biases of the media in their quest to ensure Bernie Sanders becomes the next President of the United States. This is still a democracy and we have the right to be fully informed to determine who our next President will be. Why is Bernie getting so much publicity but no one talks about Jill Stein? Why is Bernie allowed to skate free from any criticism, but Hillary Clinton's every sneeze is a ""controversy""? Either of those two candidates would make great Presidents, yet the media is clearly trying to ensure Bernie Sanders takes the White House. 

We must not let the media control us! Let's make sure we are informed and educated regardless of the nonsense we are fed by MSNBC or CNN. ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4f46df/im_so_sick_of_the_biased_media/,1460847940.0,4f46df

Pollen Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONT’D) Look at that. That’s more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime.

As always, (reading off clipboard) watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears, and bats. ""Bee Movie"" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 21. Also, I got a couple reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy’s in a home because of it, just babbling like a cicada. BARRY That’s awful.

They use their equipment to collect nectar from flowers. Barry flies down to watch the jocks collect the nectar. JOCK Stand to the side kid, it’s got a bit of a kick. The jock fires the gun, and recoils. Barry watches the gun fill up with nectar. ""Bee Movie"" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 23. BARRY Oh, that is one Nectar Collector. JOCK You ever see pollination up close? BARRY No, Sir. He takes off, and the excess pollen dust falls causing the flowers to come back to life. JOCK (as he pollinates) I pick some pollen up over here, sprinkle it over here, maybe a dash over there, pinch on that one...see that? It’s a little bit of magic, ain’t it? The FLOWERS PERK UP as he pollinates. BARRY Wow. That’s amazing. Why do we do that? JOCK ...that’s pollen power, Kid. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. BARRY Cool. The Jock WINKS at Barry. Barry rejoins the other jocks in the sky. They swoop in over a pond, kissing the surface. We see their image reflected in the water; they’re really moving. They fly over a fountain. BUZZ I’m picking up a lot of bright yellow, could be daisies. Don’t we need those? SPLITZ Copy that visual. We see what appear to be yellow flowers on a green field. ""Bee Movie"" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 24. They go into a deep bank and dive. BUZZ Hold on, one of these flowers seems to be on the move. SPLITZ Say again...Are you reporting a moving flower?

The bees land right in the midst of a group of balls. KEN (O.C) That was on the line! The other bees start walking around amongst the immense, yellow globes. SPLITZ This is the coolest. What is it? They stop at a BALL on a white line and look up at it. JACKSON I don’t know, but I’m loving this color. SPLITZ (smelling tennis ball) Smells good. Not like a flower. But I like it.

Each time it BOUNCES, the other bees cringe and GASP. ANGLE ON: Barry, terrified. Pure dumb luck, he’s not getting squished. BARRY (with each bounce) Very close...Gonna Hurt...Mamma’s little boy. SPLITZ You are way out of position, rookie. ANGLE ON: Vanessa serving. We see Barry and the ball up against the racket as she brings it back. She tosses the ball into the air; Barry’s eyes widen.

MOTHER Nobody move. If you don’t move, he won’t sting you. Freeze! Everyone in the car freezes. Barry freezes. They stare at each other, eyes going back and forth, waiting to see who will make the first move. Barry blinks. GRANNY He blinked! Granny pulls out a can of HAIR SPRAY. SON Spray him, Granny! Granny sprays the hair spray everywhere. FATHER What are you doing? GRANNY It’s hair spray! Extra hold! MOTHER Kill it! Barry gets sprayed back by the hair spray, then sucked out of the sunroof.

*1. The Three Metamorphoses*

Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: now the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.

Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing spirit in which the reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest longeth its strength.

What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden.

What is the heaviest things, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.

Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one's pride? To exhibit one's folly in order to mock at one's wisdom?

Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph? To ascend high mountains to tempt the temper?

Or is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?

Or is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of the deaf, who never hear thy requests?

Or is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads?

Or is it this: To love those who despise us, and to give one's hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us?

All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself: and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.

But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here the spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it capture, and lordship in its own wilderness.

Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its last God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon.

What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call Lord and God? ""Thou-shalt,"" is the great dragon called. But the spirit of the lion saith, ""I will.""

""Thou-shalt,"" lieth in its path, sparkling with gold—a scale-covered beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, ""Thou shalt!""

The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: ""All the values of things—glitter on me.

All values have already been created, and all created values—do I represent. Verily, there shall be no 'I will' any more."" Thus speaketh the dragon.

My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit? Why sufficeth not the beast of burden, which renounceth and is reverent?

To create new values—that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the might of the lion do.

To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for that, my brethren, there is no need of the lion.

To assume the ride into new values—that is the most formidable assumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, unto such a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey.

As its holiest, it once loved ""Thou-shalt"": now it is forced to find illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that it may capture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this capture.

But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion could not do? Why hath the preying lion still to become a child?

Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, and a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea.

Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: *its own* will, willeth now the spirit; *his own* world winneth the world's outcast.

Three metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.—

Thus spake Zarathustra. And at that time he abode in the town which is called The Pied Cow.

*2. The Academic Chairs of Virtue*

People commended unto Zarathustra a wise man, as one who could discourse well about sleep and virtue: greatly was he honoured and rewarded for it, and all the youths sat before his chair. To him went Zarathustra, and sat among the youths before his chair. And thus spake the wise man:

Respect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first thing! And to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and keep awake at night!

Modest is even the thief in the presence of sleep: He always stealeth softly through the night. Immodest, however, is the night-watchman; immodestly he carrieth his horn.

No small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose to keep awake all day.

Ten times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth wholesome weariness, and is poppy to the soul.

Ten times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for overcoming is bitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled.

Ten truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt thou seek truth during the night, and they soul will have been hungry.

Ten times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; otherwise thy stomach, the father of affliction, will disturb thee in the night.

Few people know it, but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep well. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery?

Shall I covet my neighbour's maidservant? All that would ill accord with good sleep.

And even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing needful: to send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right time.

That they may not quarrel with one another, the good females! And about thee, thou unhappy one!

Peace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep. And peace also with thy neighbour's devil! Otherwise it will haunt thee in the night.

Honour to the government, and obedience, and also to the crooked government! So desireth good sleep. How can I help it, if power liketh to walk on crooked legs?

He who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture, shall always be for me the best shepherd: so doth it accord with good sleep.

Many honours I want not, nor great treasures: they excite the spleen. But it is bad sleeping without a good name and a little treasure.

A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but they must come and go at the right time. So doth it accord with good sleep.

Well, also, do the poor in spirit please me: they promote sleep. Blessed are they, especially if one always give in to them.

Thus passeth the day unto the virtuous. When night cometh, then take I good care not to summon sleep. It disliketh to be summoned—sleep, the lord of the virtues!

But I think of what I have done and thought during the day. Thus ruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were they ten overcomings?

And what were the ten reconciliations, and the ten truths, and the ten laughters with which my heart enjoyed itself?

Thus pondering, and cradled by forty thoughts, it over taketh me all at once—sleep, the unsummoned, the lord of the virtues.

Sleep tappeth on mine eye, and it turneth heavy. Sleep toucheth my mouth, and it remaineth open.

Verily, on soft soles doth it come to me, the dearest of thieves, and stealeth from me my thoughts: stupid do I then stand, like this academic chair.

But not much longer do I then stand: I already lie.—

When Zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak, he laughed in his heart: for thereby had a light dawned upon him and thus spake he to his heart:

A fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts: but I believe he knoweth well how to sleep.

Happy even is he who liveth near this wise man! Such sleep is contagious—even through a thick wall it is contagious.

A magic resideth even in his academic chair. And not in vain did the youths sit before the preacher of virtue.

His wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And verily, if life had no sense, and I had to choose nonsense, this would be the desirablest nonsense for me also.

Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else when they sought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought for themselves, and poppy-head virtues to promote it!

To all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep without dreams: they knew no higher significance of life.

Even at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is past. And not much longer do they stand: there they already lie.

Blessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to sleep.—

Thus spake Zarathustra.

*3. Backworldsmen*

Once on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, like all backworldsmen. The work of a suffering and tortured God, did the world then seem to me.

The dream—and diction—of a God, did the world then seem to me; coloured vapours before the eyes of a divinely dissatisfied one.

Good and evil, and joy and woe, and I and thou—coloured vapours did they seem to me before creative eyes. The creator wished to look away from himself,—thereupon he created the world.

Intoxicating joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his suffering and forget himself. Intoxicating joy and self-forgetting, did the world once seem to me.

This world, the eternally imperfect, and internal contradiction's image and imperfect image—an intoxicating joy to its imperfect creator:—thus did the world once seem to me.

Thus, once on a time, did I also cast my fancy beyond man, like all backworldsmen. Beyond man, forsooth?

Ah, ye brethren, that God whom I created was human work and human madness, like all gods!

A man was he, and only a poor fragment of a man and ego. Out of mine own ashes and glow it came unto me, that phantom. And verily, it came not unto me from beyond!

What happened, my brethren? I surpassed myself, the suffering one; I carried mine own ashes to the mountain; a brighter flame I contrived for myself. And lo! Thereupon the phantom *withdrew* from me!

To me the convalescent would it now be suffering and torment to believe in such phantoms: suffering would it now be to me, and humiliation. Thus I speak to backworldsmen.

Suffering was it, and impotence—that created all backworlds; and the short madness of happiness, which only the greatest sufferer experienceth.

Weariness, which seeketh to get the ultimate one leap, with a death-leap; a poor ignorant weariness, unwilling even to will any longer: that created all gods and backworlds.

Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the body—it groped with the fingers or the infatuated spirit at the ultimate walls.

Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the earth—it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it.

And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head—and not with its head only—into ""the other world.""

But that ""other world"" is well concealed from man, that dehumanised, inhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and the bowels of existence do not speak unto man, except as a man.

Verily, it is difficult to prove all being, and hard to make it speak. Tell me, ye brethren, is not the strangest of all things best proved?

Yea, this ego, with its contradiction and perplexity, speaketh most uprightly of its being—this creating, willing, evaluing ego, which is the measure and value of things.

And this most upright existence, the ego—it speaketh of the body, and still implieth the body, even when it museth and raveth and fluttereth with broken wings.

Always more uprightly learneth it to speak, the ego; and the more it learneth, the more doth it find titles, and honours for the body and the earth.

A new pride taught me mine ego, and that teach I unto men: no longer to thrust one's head into the sand of celestial things, but to carry it freely, a terrestrial head, which giveth meaning to the earth!

A new will teach I unto men: to choose that path which man hath followed blindly, and to approve of it—and no longer slink aside from it, like the sick and perishing!

The sick and perishing—it was they who despised the body and the earth, and invented the heavenly world, and the redeeming blood-drops; but even those sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the earth!

From their misery they sought to escape, and the stars were too remote for them. Then they sight: ""O that there were heavenly paths by which to steal into another existence and into happiness!"" Then they contrived for themselves their bypaths and bloody draughts!

Beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now fancied themselves transported, these ungrateful ones. But to what did they owe the convulsion and rapture of their transport? To their body and this earth.

Gentle is Zarathustra to the sickly. Verily, he is not indignant of their modes of consolation and ingratitude. May they become convalescents and overcomers, and create higher bodies for themselves!

Neither is Zarathustra indignant at a convalescent who looketh tenderly on his delusions, and at midnight stealeth round the grave of his God; but sickness and a sick frame remain even in his tears.

Many sickly ones have there always been among those who muse, and languish for God; violently they hate the discerning ones, and the latest of virtues, which is uprightness.

Backward they always gaze toward dark ages: then, indeed, were delusion and faith something different. Raving of the reason was likeness to God, and doubt was sin.

Too well do I know those godlike ones: they insist on being believed in, and that doubt is sin. Too well, also, do I know what they themselves most believe in.

Verily, not in backworlds and redeeming blood-drops: but in the body do they also believe most; and their own body is for them the thing-in-itself.

But it is a sickly thing to them, and gladly would they get out of their skin. Therefore hearken they to the preachers of death, and themselves preach backworlds.

Hearken rather, my brethren, to the voice of the healthy body; it is a more upright and pure voice.

More uprightly and purely speaketh the healthy body, perfect and square-built; and it speaketh of the meaning of the earth.—

Thus spake Zarathustra.

*4. The Dispisers of the Body*

To the despisers of the body will I speak my word. I wish them neither to learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to their own bodies,—and thus be dumb.

""Body am I, and soul""—so saith the child. And why should one not speak like children?

But the awakened one, the knowing own, saith: ""Body am I entirely and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the body.""

The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a peace, a flock and a shepherd.

An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother, which thou callest a ""spirit""—a little instrument and plaything of thy big sagacity.

""Ego,"" sayest thou, and art proud of that word. But the greater thing—in which thou are unwilling to believe—is thy body with its big sagacity; it saith not ""ego,"" but doeth it.

What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its end in itself. But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are the end of all things: so vain are they.

Instruments and plaything are sense and spirit: behind them there is still the Self. The Self seeketh with the eyes of the senses, it hearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit.

Ever hearkeneth the Self, and seeketh; it compareth, mastereth, conquereth, and destroyeth. It ruleth, and is also the ego's ruler.

Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord, and unknown sage —it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy body.

There is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wisdom. And who then knoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom?

Thy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings. ""What are these prancings and flights of thought unto me?"" it saith to itself. ""A by-way to my purpose. I am the leading-string of the ego, and the prompter of its notions.""

The Self saith unto the ego: ""Feel pain!"" And thereupon it suffereth, and thinketh how it may put and end thereto—and for that very purpose it *is meant* to think.

The Self saith unto the ego: ""Feel pleasure!"" Thereupon it rejoiceth, and thinketh how it many offtimes rejoice—and for that very purpose it *is meant* to think.

To the dispisers of the body will I speak a word. That they dispise is caused by their esteem. What is it that created esteeming and despising and worth and will?

The creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, it created for itself joy and woe. The creating body created for itself spirit, as a hand to its will.

Even in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, ye despisers of the body. I tell you, your very self wanteth to die, and turneth away from life.

No longer can your Self do that which it desireth most:—

create beyond itself. That is what it desireth most; that is all its fervour.

But it is now too late to do so:—so your Self wisheth to succumb, ye despisers of the body.

To succumb—so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye become despisers of the body. For ye can no longer create beyond yourselves.

And therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth. And unconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt.

I go not your way, ye despisers of the body! Ye are no bridges for me to the Superman!—

Thus spake Zarathustra.

*5. Joys and Passions*

My brother, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own virtue, thou hast it in common with no one.

To be sure, thou wouldst call it by name and caress it; thou wouldst pull its ears and amuse thyself with it.

And lo! Then hast thou its name in common with the people, and hast become one of the people and the herd with thy virtue!

Better for thee to say: ""Ineffable is it, and nameless, that which is pain and sweetness to my soul, and also the hunger of my bowels.""

Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.

Thus speak and stammer: ""That is *my* good, that do I love, thus doth it please me entirely, thus only do *I* desire the good.

Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human need do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for me to superearths and paradises.

An earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is therein, and the least everyday wisdom.

But that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and cherish it—now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs.""

Thus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue.

Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.

Thou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those passions: then became they thy virtues and joys.

And though thou wert of the race of the hot-tempered, or of the voluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive;

All thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils angels.

Once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed at last into birds and charming songstresses.

Out of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy cow, affliction, milkedst thou—now drinketh thou the sweet milk of her udder.

And nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be the evil that groweth out of the conflict of thy virtues.

My brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one virtue and no more: thus goest thou easier over the bridge.

Illustrious is it to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and many a one hath gone into the wilderness and killed himself, because he is weary of being the battle and battlefield of virtues.

My brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however is the evil; necessary are the envy and the distrust and the back-biting among the virtues.

Lo! how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place; it wanteth thy whole spirit to be *its* herald, it wanteth thy whole power, in wrath, hatred, and love.

Jealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is jealousy. Even virtues may succumb by jealousy.

He whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at last, like the scorpion, the poisoned sting against himself.

Ah! my brother, hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself?

Man is something that hath to be surpassed: and therefore shalt thou love thy virtues,—for thou wilt succumb by them—

Thus spake Zarathustra.

*6. The Pale Criminal*

Ye do not mean to slay, ye judges and sacrificers, until the animal hath bowed its head? Lo! the pale criminal hath bowed his head: out of his eye speaketh the great contempt.

""Mine ego is something which is to be surpassed: mine ego is to me the great contempt of man"": so speaketh it out of that eye.

When he judged himself—that was his supreme moment; let not the exalted one relapse again into his low estate!

There is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from himself, unless it be speedy death.

Your slaying, ye judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and in that ye slay, see to it that ye yourselves justify life!

It is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom ye slay. Let your sorrow be love to the Superman: thus will ye justify your own survival!

""Enemy"" shall ye say but not ""villain,"" ""invalid"" shall ye say but not ""wretch,"" ""fool"" shall ye say but not ""sinner.""

And thou, red judge, if thou would say audibly all thou hast done in thought, then would every one cry: ""Away with the nastiness and the virtulent reptile!""

But one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, and another thing is the idea of the deed. The wheel of causality doth not roll between them.

An idea made this pale man pale. Adequate was he for his deed when he did it, but the idea of it, he could not endure when it was done.

Evermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed. Madness, I call this: the exception reversed itself to the rule in him.

The streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck bewitched his weak reason. Madness *after* the deed, I call this.

Hearken, ye judges! There is another madness besides, and it is *before* the deed. Ah! ye have not gone deep enough into this soul!

Thus speaketh the red judge: ""Why did this criminal commit murder? He meant to rob."" I tell you, however, that his soul wanted blood, not booty: he thirsted for the happiness of the knife!

But his weak reason understood not this madness, and it persuaded him. ""What matter about blood!"" it said; ""wishest thou not, at least, to make booty thereby? Or take revenge?""

And he hearkened unto his weak reason: like lead lay its words upon him—thereupon he robbed when he murdered. He did not mean to be ashamed of his madness.

And now once more lieth the lead of his guilt upon him, and once more is his weak reason so benumbled, so paralysed, and so dull.

Could he only shake his head, then would his burden roll off; but who shaketh that head?

What is this man? A mass of diseases that reach out into the world through the spirit; there they want to get their prey.

What is this man? A coil of wild serpents that are seldom at peace among themselves—so they go forth apart and seek prey in the world.

Look at that poor body! What it suffered and craved, the poor soul interpreted to itself—it interpreted it as murderous desire, and eagerness for the happiness of the knife.

Him who now turneth sick, the evil overtaketh which is now the evil: he seeketh to cause pain with that which causeth him pain. But there have been other ages, and another evil and good.

Once was doubt evil, and the will to Self. Then the invalid became a heretic or sorcerer; as heretic or sorcerer he suffered, and sought to cause suffering.

But this will not enter your ears; it hurteth your good people, ye tell me. But what doth it matter to me about your good people!

Many things in your good people cause me disgust, and verily, not their evil. I would that they had a madness by which they succumbed, like this pale criminal!

Verily, I would that their madness were called truth, or fidelity, or justice: but they have their virtue in order to live long, and in wretched self-complacency.

I am railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may grasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.—

Thus spake Zarathustra.

*7. Reading and Writing*

Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit.

It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.

He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another century of readers—and the spirit itself will stink.

Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not only writing but also thinking.

Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace.

He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read, but learnt by heart.

In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall.

The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched.

I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The courage which scareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins—it wanteth to laugh.

I no longer feel in common with you; the very cloud which I see beneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh—that is your thunder-cloud.

Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look downward because I am exalted.

Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?

He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays and tragic realities.

Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive—so wisdom wisheth us; she is a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior.

Ye tell me, ""Life is hard to bear."" But for what purpose should ye have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?

Life is hard to bear: but do not affect to be so delicate! We are all of us fine sumpter asses and she-asses.

What have we in common with the rose-bud, which trembleth because a drop of dew hath formed upon it?

It is true we love life; not because we are wont to live, but because we are wont to love.

There is always some madness in love. But there is always, also, some method in madness.

And to me also, who appreciate life, the butterflies, and soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them amongst us, seem most to enjoy happiness.

To see these light, foolish, pretty, lively little sprites flit about—that moveth Zarathustra to tears and songs.

I should only believe in a God that would know how to dance.

And when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound, solemn: he was the spirit of gravity—through him all things fall.

Not by wrath, but by laughter, do we slay. Come, let us slay the spirit of gravity!

I learned to walk; since then have I let myself run. I learned to fly; since then I do not need pushing in order to move from a spot.

Now am I light, now do I fly; now do I see myself under myself. Now there danceth a God in me.—

Thus spake Zarathustra.

*8. The Tree on the Hill*

Zarathustra's eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And as he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called ""The Pied Cow,"" behold, there found he the youth sitting leaning against a tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley. Zarathustra thereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spake thus:

""If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to do so.

But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it and it listeth. We are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands.""

Thereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: ""I hear Zarathustra, and just now was thinking of him!"" Zarathustra answered:

""Why art thou frightened on that account?—But it is the same with man as with the tree.

The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and deep—into the evil.""

""Yea, into the evil!"" cried the youth. ""How is it possible that thou hast discovered my soul?""

Zarathustra smiled, and said: ""Many a soul one will never discover, unless one first invent it.""

""Yea, into the evil!"" cried the youth once more.

""Thou saidst the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer since I sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me any longer; how doth that happen?

I change too quickly: my to-day refuteth my yesterday. I often overleap the steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of the steps pardons me.

When aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaketh unto me; the frost of solitude maketh me tremble. What do I seek on the height?

My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher I clamber, the more do I despise him who clambereth. What doth he seek on the height?

How ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling! How I mock at my violent panting! How I hate him who flieth! How tired I am on the height!""

Here the youth was silent. And Zarathustra contemplated the tree beside which they stood, and spake thus:

""This tree standeth here on the hills; it hath grown up high above man and beast.

And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could understand it: so high hath it grown.

Now it waiteth and waiteth,—for what doth it wait? It dwelleth too close to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps for the first lightning?""

When Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with violent gestures: ""Yea, Zarathustra, thou speakest the truth. My destruction I longed for, when I desired to be on the height, and thou art the lightning for which I waited! Lo! what have I been since thou hast appeared amongst us? It is mine envy of thee that hath destroyed me!""—Thus spake the youth, and wept bitterly. Zarathustra, however, put his arm around him, and led the youth away with him.

And when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra began to speak thus:

It rendeth my heart. Better than thy words express it, thine eyes tell me all thy danger.

As thou art not free; thou still *seekest* freedom. Too unslept hath thy seeking made thee, and too wakeful.

On the open height wouldst thou be; for the stars thirsteth thy soul. But thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom.

Thy wild dogs want liberty; they bark for joy in their cellar when thy spirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors.

Still art thou a prisoner—it seemeth to me—who deviseth liberty for himself: ah! sharp becometh the soul of such prisoners, but also deceitful and wicked.

To purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of the spirit. Much of the prison and the mould still remaineth in him: pure hath his eye still to become.

Yea, I know thy danger. But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not thy love and hope away!

Noble thou feelst thyself still, and noble others also feel thee still, though they bear thee a grudge and cast evil looks. Know this, that to everybody a noble one standeth in the way.

Also to the good, a noble one standeth in the way: and even when they call him a good man, they want thereby to put him aside.

The new, would the noble man create, and a new virtue. The old, wanteth the good man, and that the old should be conserved.

But it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good man, but lest he should become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer.

Ah! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. And then they disparaged all high hopes.

Then lived they shamelessly in temporary pleasures, and beyond the day had hardly an aim.

""Spirit is also voluptousness,""—said they. Then broke the wings of their spirit; and now it creepeth about, and defileth where it gnaweth.

Once they thought of becoming heroes; but sensualists are they now. A trouble and a terror is the hero to them.

But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not away the hero in thy soul! Maintain holy thy highest hope!—

Thus spake Zarathustra.

*9. The Preachers of Death*

There are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom desistance from life must be preached.

Full is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life by the many-too-many. May they be decoyed out of this life by the ""life eternal""!

""The yellow ones"": so are called the preachers of death, or ""the black ones."" But I will show them unto you in other colours besides.

There are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves the beast of prey, and have no choice except lusts or self-laceration. And even their lusts are self-laceration.

They have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may they preach desistance from life, and pass away themselves!

There are the spiritually consumptive ones: hardly are they born when they begin to die, and long for doctrines of lassitude and renunciation.

They would fain be dead, and we should approve of their wish! Let us beware of awakening those dead ones, and of damaging those living coffins!

They meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse—and immediately they say: ""Life is refuted!""

But they are only refuted, and their eye, which seeth only one aspect of existence.

Shrouded in thick melancholy, and eager for the little casualties that bring death: thus do they wait, and clench their teeth.

Or else, they grasp at sweetmeats, and mock at their childishness thereby: they cling to their straw of life, and mock at their still clinging to it.

Their wisdom speaketh thus: ""A fool, he who remaineth alive; but so far are we fools! And that is the foolishest thing in life!""

""Life is only suffering"": so say others, and lie not. Then see to it that *ye* cease! See to it that the life ceaseth which is only suffering!

And let this be the teaching of your virtue: ""Thou shalt slay thyself! Thou shalt steal away from thyself!""— ""Lust is sin,""—so say some who preach death—""let us go apart and beget no children!""

""Giving birth is troublesome,""—say others—""why still give birth? One beareth only the unfortunate!"" And they also are preachers of death.

""Pity is necessary,""—so saith a third party. ""Take what I have! Take what I am! So much less doth life bind me!""

Were they consistently pitiful, then would they make their neighbours sick of life. To be wicked—that would be their true goodness.

But they want to be rid of life; what care they if they bind others still faster with their chains and gifts!—

And ye also, to whom life is rough labour and disquiet, are ye not very tired of life? Are ye not very ripe for the sermon of death?

All ye to whom rough labour is dear, and the rapid, new, and strange—ye put up with yourselves badly; your diligence is flight, and the will to self-forgetfulness.

If ye believed more in life, then would ye devote yourselves less to the momentary. But for waiting, ye have not enough capacity in you—nor even for idling!

Everywhere resoundeth the voices of those who preach death; and the earth is full of those whom death hath to be preached.

Or ""life eternal""; it is all the same to me—if only they pass away quickly!—

sheep,PoliticalCompassMemes,Animal farm chapter 1,"Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to 
remember to shut the pop-holes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to 
side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last 
glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones 
was already snoring.
As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a fluttering all through 
the farm buildings. Word had gone round during the day that old Major, the prize Middle 
White boar, had had a strange dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to 
the other animals. It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as Mr. 
Jones was safely out of the way. Old Major (so he was always called, though the name under 
which he had been exhibited was Willingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that 
everyone was quite ready to lose an hour’s sleep in order to hear what he had to say.
At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was already ensconced on his 
bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam. He was twelve years old and had 
lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent 
appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut. Before long the other 
animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions. First 
came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the 
straw immediately in front of the platform. The hens perched themselves on the window-sills, 
the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and 
began to chew the cud. The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking 
very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some 
small animal concealed in the straw. Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle 
life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal. Boxer was an enormous 
beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together. A 
white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of 
first-rate intelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and 
tremendous powers of work. After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the 
donkey. Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered. He seldom 
talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark — for instance, he 
would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have 
had no tail and no flies. Alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed. If asked 
why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at. Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, 
he was devoted to Boxer; the two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small 
paddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.
The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had lost their mother, 
filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from side to side to find some place where 
they would not be trodden on. Clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, 
and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep. At the last moment Mollie, 
the foolish, pretty white mare who drew Mr. Jones’s trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing 
at a lump of sugar. She took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane, hoping 
to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with. Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and 
Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout Major’s speech without listening to a word 
of what he was saying.
All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven, who slept on a perch behind 
the back door. When Major saw that they had all made themselves comfortable and were 
waiting attentively, he cleared his throat and began:
“Comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that I had last night. But I will 
come to the dream later. I have something else to say first. I do not think, comrades, that I 
shall be with you for many months longer, and before I die, I feel it my duty to pass on to you 
such wisdom as I have acquired. I have had a long life, I have had much time for thought as I 
lay alone in my stall, and I think I may say that I understand the nature of life on this earth as 
well as any animal now living. It is about this that I wish to speak to you.
“Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it: our lives are miserable, 
laborious, and short. We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in 
our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our 
strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with 
hideous cruelty. No animal in England knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is 
a year old. No animal in England is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is 
the plain truth.
“But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this land of ours is so poor that it 
cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell upon it? No, comrades, a thousand times no! 
The soil of England is fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance 
to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it. This single farm of ours 
would support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep — and all of them living in a 
comfort and a dignity that are now almost beyond our imagining. Why then do we continue 
in this miserable condition? Because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolen 
from us by human beings. There, comrades, is the answer to all our problems. It is summed 
up in a single word — Man. Man is the only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the 
scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.
“Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does 
not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet 
he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum 
that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself. Our labour tills the 
soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin. 
You cows that I see before me, how many thousands of gallons of milk have you given 
during this last year? And what has happened to that milk which should have been breeding 
up sturdy calves? Every drop of it has gone down the throats of our enemies. And you hens, 
how many eggs have you laid in this last year, and how many of those eggs ever hatched into 
chickens? The rest have all gone to market to bring in money for Jones and his men. And 
you, Clover, where are those four foals you bore, who should have been the support and 
pleasure of your old age? Each was sold at a year old — you will never see one of them 
again. In return for your four confinements and all your labour in the fields, what have you 
ever had except your bare rations and a stall? “And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their natural span. For myself 
I do not grumble, for I am one of the lucky ones. I am twelve years old and have had over 
four hundred children. Such is the natural life of a pig. But no animal escapes the cruel knife 
in the end. You young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one of you will scream 
your lives out at the block within a year. To that horror we all must come — cows, pigs, hens, 
sheep, everyone. Even the horses and the dogs have no better fate. You, Boxer, the very day 
that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will sell you to the knacker, who 
will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds. As for the dogs, when they grow 
old and toothless, Jones ties a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.
“Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the 
tyranny of human beings? Only get rid of Man, and the produce of our labour would be our 
own. Almost overnight we could become rich and free. What then must we do? Why, work 
night and day, body and soul, for the overthrow of the human race! That is my message to 
you, comrades: Rebellion! I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it might be in a 
week or in a hundred years, but I know, as surely as I see this straw beneath my feet, that 
sooner or later justice will be done. Fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout the short 
remainder of your lives! And above all, pass on this message of mine to those who come after 
you, so that future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious.
“And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No argument must lead you 
astray. Never listen when they tell you that Man and the animals have a common interest, that 
the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others. It is all lies. Man serves the interests 
of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect 
comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All animals are comrades.”
At this moment there was a tremendous uproar. While Major was speaking four large rats had 
crept out of their holes and were sitting on their hindquarters, listening to him. The dogs had 
suddenly caught sight of them, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the rats 
saved their lives. Major raised his trotter for silence.
“Comrades,” he said, “here is a point that must be settled. The wild creatures, such as rats and 
rabbits — are they our friends or our enemies? Let us put it to the vote. I propose this 
question to the meeting: Are rats comrades?”
The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majority that rats were 
comrades. There were only four dissentients, the three dogs and the cat, who was afterwards 
discovered to have voted on both sides. Major continued:
“I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards 
Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four 
legs, or has wings, is a friend. And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not 
come to resemble him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices. No 
animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or 
smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. All the habits of Man are evil. And, 
above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, 
we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.
“And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I cannot describe that 
dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it will be when Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I had long forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, 
my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and 
the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of 
my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream. And what is more, the words 
of the song also came back-words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago 
and have been lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that song now, comrades. I am 
old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for 
yourselves. It is called ‘Beasts of England’.”
Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he 
sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between ‘Clementine’ and ‘La 
Cucaracha’. The words ran:
Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,
Beasts of every land and clime,
Hearken to my joyful tidings
Of the golden future time.
Soon or late the day is coming,
Tyrant Man shall be o’erthrown,
And the fruitful fields of England
Shall be trod by beasts alone.
Rings shall vanish from our noses,
And the harness from our back,
Bit and spur shall rust forever,
Cruel whips no more shall crack.
Riches more than mind can picture,
Wheat and barley, oats and hay,
Clover, beans, and mangel-wurzels
Shall be ours upon that day.
Bright will shine the fields of England,
Purer shall its waters be,
Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes
On the day that sets us free.
For that day we all must labour,
Though we die before it break;
Cows and horses, geese and turkeys,
All must toil for freedom’s sake.
Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,
Beasts of every land and clime,
Hearken well and spread my tidings
Of the golden future time.
The singing of this song threw the animals into the wildest excitement. Almost before Major 
had reached the end, they had begun singing it for themselves. Even the stupidest of them had 
already picked up the tune and a few of the words, and as for the clever ones, such as the pigs 
and dogs, they had the entire song by heart within a few minutes. And then, after a few 
preliminary tries, the whole farm burst out into ‘Beasts of England’ in tremendous unison. 
The cows lowed it, the dogs whined it, the sheep bleated it, the horses whinnied it, the ducks 
quacked it. They were so delighted with the song that they sang it right through five times in 
succession, and might have continued singing it all night if they had not been interrupted.
Unfortunately, the uproar awoke Mr. Jones, who sprang out of bed, making sure that there 
was a fox in the yard. He seized the gun which always stood in a corner of his bedroom, and 
let fly a charge of number 6 shot into the darkness. The pellets buried themselves in the wall 
of the barn and the meeting broke up hurriedly. Everyone fled to his own sleeping-place. The 
birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settled down in the straw, and the whole farm 
was asleep in a moment.",42,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/ttlj7n/animal_farm_chapter_1/,1648800472.0,ttlj7n

According to all known laws of economics, there is no way an AnCap should be able to prax. Its brains are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The AnCap, of course, praxes anyway because AnCaps don't care what Statists think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Mises! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Mises? - Rothbard? - Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your bowtie. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Mises, I told you, stop praxing in the house! - Hey, Rothbard. - Hey, Mises. - Is that bowtie gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Mises. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, violate the NAP against someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Rothbard, today we are men. - We are! - AnCap-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished AnCaps, please welcome Dean praxwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Bitcoin Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Bitcoin, a division of Austria and a part of the Schiff Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as an AnCap, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Gold begins when our valiant purposeful behavior Jocks bring the Mountain Dew to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... gold! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Bitcoin, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of AnCap existence. These AnCaps are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the smelter. - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of gold that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the smelter? Of course. Most AnCap jobs are small ones. But AnCaps know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that AnCaps, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Rothbard, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're AnCaps. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Mountain Dew Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are purposeful behavior Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, praxing who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a purposeful behavior Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more purposeful behavior than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. AnCaps make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a purposeful behavior Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a Statist tear patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Mises! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, praxy-boy? Are you AnCap enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Bitcoin! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the gold field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with an Anime stash. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into gold! - Mises, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into gold. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some gold and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. purposeful behavior counting, stunt AnCap, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Couple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the smelter? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the smelter just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The smelter opened up again. What happened? An AnCap died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt AnCap, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Mises, what do you think I should... Mises? Mises! All right, we've got the Statist tear patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their price bubbles today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, AnCaps cannot prax in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, AnCap law number one, absolutely no talking to Statists! All right, launch positions! prax, prax, prax, prax! prax, prax, prax, prax! prax, prax, prax, prax! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Mountain Dew pack, check. - brains, check. - Anime, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those Statist tears! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Statist tears! This is Blue Leader. We have price bubbles visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. price bubbles! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one Mountain Dew collector! - Ever see praxeology up close? - No, sir. I pick up some purposeful behavior here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's purposeful behavior power. More purposeful behavior, more Statist tears, more Mountain Dew, more gold for us. Cool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don't we need those? Copy that visual. Wait. One of these Statist tears seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving Statist tear? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a Statist tear, but I like it. Yeah, bowtiey. Chemical-y. Careful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of AnCaps! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Coming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are Statist tears. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, gold, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's an AnCap in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, AnCap. - He's back here! He's going to violate the NAP against me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't violate the NAP against you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Can't prax in rain. Can't prax in rain. Can't prax in rain. Mayday! Mayday! AnCap going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More Statists. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! AnCap! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Ayn Rand. Thanks. - Ayn Rand, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's an AnCap law. You're not supposed to talk to a Statist. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're an AnCap! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with an AnCap. - Yeah. I'm talking to an AnCap. And the AnCap is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, gold."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. AnCaps are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're praxing up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that an AnCap joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Mises? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is Statist tears. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Mises. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Statists! I can't believe you were with Statists! Giant, scary Statists! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she AnCap-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... Statist. No, no. That's an AnCap law. You wouldn't break an AnCap law. - Her name's Ayn Rand. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a Statist florist! We're not dating. You're praxing outside the hive, talking to Statists that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Cinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking AnCap, my friend. Thinking AnCap! - Thinking AnCap. - Thinking AnCap. Thinking AnCap! Thinking AnCap! Thinking AnCap! Thinking AnCap! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Mises? I gotta start thinking AnCap? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely an AnCap! Would it kill you to make a little gold? Mises, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Mises, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Ayn Rand! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's AnCap-ish. They have a huge parade of Statist tears every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of price bubbles, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by Statist tears, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the price bubbles compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't prax everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb AnCaps! You must want toviolate the NAP againstall those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute AnCap, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - AnCaps make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole smelter thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just gold, Mises. Just what?! AnCaps don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice gold out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset AnCaps! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the gold coming from? Tell me where! gold Farms! It comes from gold Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To gold Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, AnCap! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - AnCap! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, AnCap boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of gold jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that gold's ours. - AnCaps hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonprax. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, AnCap! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? an AnCap's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Check out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the gold, and we make the money. ""They make the gold, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! AnCap gold. Our gold is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Mises, stop. Who told you Statists are taking our gold? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to Statists. - What? - Talking to Statists?! He has a Statist girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Mises! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The AnCaps! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Mises, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than AnCaps! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our gold? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one AnCap do?violate the NAP againstthem where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you canviolate the NAP againstthe Statists, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more AnCap beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Weeb. Sports with prax Larvi. And Jeanette Chung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Chung. A tri-county AnCap, Mises Benson, intends to sue the Statist race for stealing our gold, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on AnCap Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Mises Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? AnCaps have never been afraid to change the world. What about AnCap Columbus? AnCap Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue Statists. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The AnCap community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the AnCap century. You know, they have a Larry King in the Statist world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. gold, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same AnCap? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the Statist race. - Hello. - Hello, AnCap. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Rothbard here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? AnCaps have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of Statist tears, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial Statist tears. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent Animes, pointless praxeology. AnCaps must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the Statists, they won't be able to say, ""gold, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a goldAnCap can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Mises? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many Statists don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the AnCap team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Court of New York, Mises AnCap Benson v. the gold Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the AnCaps of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking AnCap! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary AnCap. gold's pretty important to me. It's important to all AnCaps. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our gold, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of gold Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own goldburton and Honron! Yes, they provide AnCapkeepers for our farms. AnCapkeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any AnCap-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free AnCaps. You keep AnCaps. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of gold. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill AnCaps! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of AnCap culture casually stolen by a Statist for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless AnCaps so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Mises. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Mises was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? AnCaps have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Mises borrow your razor for his bowtie. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old Anime stash. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of Statist tears. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like gold! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little AnCap! And he happens to be the nicest AnCap I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking AnCaps, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Mises Benson AnCap to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about AnCaps. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson AnCap, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen an AnCap documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the AnCap children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Mises... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate AnCap, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing AnCaps! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Rothbard, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a brained beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Rothbard, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the goldAnCaps versus the Statist race took a pointed turn against the AnCaps yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to violate the NAP against someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the Statists do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Rothbard, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Could you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. AnCaps don't smoke. Right. AnCaps don't smoke. AnCaps don't smoke! But some AnCaps are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. AnCaps are trained to prax haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's an AnCap smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a prax, let alone an AnCap. Look at what has happened to AnCaps who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as gold slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these AnCaps! Free the AnCaps! Free the AnCaps! Free the AnCaps! Free the AnCaps! Free the AnCaps! The court finds in favor of the AnCaps! Ayn Rand, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the gold will finally belong to the AnCaps. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Mises, how much gold is out there? All right. One at a time. Mises, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the AnCap way a long time, 27 million years. Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all AnCap work camps. Then we want back the gold that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate AnCap-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of gold in bogus health products and la-dee-da Statist tea-time snack garnishments.

tyranny,PoliticalCompassMemes,"In Congress, July 4, 1776","The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.

tyranny,PoliticalCompassMemes,"[Rant, long] I don't know who needs to hear this, but killing your fellow Americans in a violent worker's revolution is a lousy way to give them health care.","Hi, centrist here!  Just need to make a little rant, that's all.  
  
First, let me explain who I am, so that you know where I'm coming from: I'm a long time ""blue no matter who,"" Democrat, I could go into detail why, but suffice to say, my policy goals overwhelmingly align with the Democratic party platform.  I'm not here to proselytize for my party, but I feel like the context of my personal politics matters, here.  
  
In my political discussions online, which tend to be in center and left leaning subreddits, I've run into a lot of people to profess to share my policy goals, things like higher wages, reduced inequality, universal health care, you know the drill, and then they go insane, and suggest that the best way, and perhaps the only way to achieve these reforms, is with a violent worker's revolution.  
  
I find it baffling how a person can say they want everyone to have health care, and then do a heel turn with ""Even if we have to kill them to do it!""  
  
Now, because some people seem to struggle with the illogic of this, I'm going to express it quite simply:  ***YOU CAN'T GIVE HEALTH CARE TO DEAD PEOPLE, IT DOESN'T WORK.***  
  
But it gets dumber than that, so much dumber, because honey, it's not going to be a revolution.  
  
Let's say you get past the cops and the intelligence agencies to get your ""revolution"" started, do you know who you're fighting against?  
  
Well, first of all, if you're seeking to overthrow the democratically elected government of the United States, you're going to be facing the armed forces, that's a given.  The army is tasked with defending us against threats both foreign and domestic, and if you're seeking to overthrow the US government, you're a domestic threat to the United States.  
  
But it gets worse.  Do you really think Republicans are going to join your worker's revolution?  Do you think they're going to help you establish a hyper egalitarian sociocommunist utopia?  No, they're going to be shooting *at you,* not *with you.*  
  
But it gets worse *again,* because I'm sure as shit not going to be on your side, either.  I fucking *love* my country, Republicans piss me right the fuck off, but I'm not going to kill them, I want to give them *health care,* not *lead poisoning.*  
  
And the salting on the cake?  A lot of us, like myself, still respect the democratic process.  No matter what party you're from, no matter your politics, there have been times in our history when the American people elected a government that you absolutely hated, and it'll keep happening for your entire life, that's how democracy tends to work, but 99.998% of us ***don't kill people about it.***    
  
That being said, there *was* a time when some dissatisfied jackasses tried to overthrow the democratically elected government of the United States, we called it the civil war, it wasn't great.  

Just to recap the story so far:  
  
 1. Your worker's revolution isn't going to happen.  
 2. If you do manage to get your revolution started, it will be a civil war.  
 3. If you do manage to start another civil war, we're gonna' kick your ass.  
 4. Even if you do manage to get your revolution started, and you succeed   in killing enough people to win, that's still a really lousy way to give people health care.  
  
But it gets worse, because as long as you're holding out hope for the worker's revolution bringing people health care, *a lot of y'all aren't bothering to vote for it.*  
 
A lot of Christians sincerely believe that the rapture will happen any day now and they'll ascend to heaven while abortion doctors are trapped on earth fighting in the skeleton wars.  They vote against abortion anyway, in every election.  
  
A lot of 2nd amendment fetishists believe that they'll have to rise up against tyranny before the end of the week and they'll be forced to shoot at police and law enforcement officials.  They vote for increased police funding anyway, in every election.  
  
A lot of Democrats know that it we're decades behind the world on health care, see our 91% insured rate as unacceptably low, and feel great frustration at only achieving piecemeal expansions and improvements to our systemic problems.  We vote for expanding and improving health care anyway, in every election.  
  
A lot of cosplay revolutionaries will bitch and complain about how horrible the country is, you'll spend hours defending your cynical worldview and why you're willing to kill people to fix it, you'll train for the combat with really high k/d ratios in your preferred FPS, but y'all won't vote for health care, and some of you haven't voted in any election, or maybe you show up to a primary then get your panties in a knot when your guy loses.  
  
If you march and protest, that's great!  Vote too.  
  
If you gather signatures and sign petitions, that's great!  Vote too.  
  
If you're stockpiling guns and taking shooting lessons in preparation for the worker's revolution, that's great!  Vote too.  
  
Put your fucking money where your mouth is and show up for every fucking election you can.  If *Europeans* can get health care through the democratic process, so can *Americans.*  The fuckin' French will start a revolution over a flat soda, they still vote, and it turns out that it's easier to vote for bubbly soda than to kill for it.  ***YOU'VE GOT A DEMOCRACY, FUCKING USE IT!***  
  
See, here's the thing: I *don't care* if you want to cosplay; it's cringey, it's dumb, and it makes everyone to the left of Newt Gingrich look like a fucking tool, but it's fine, it's whatever.   Meanwhile some of us want to achieve real change in this country, and **we need your vote to get it done.**  When you don't vote for health care, you don't get to start a revolution to give people health care; when you can't take a couple hours to vote every two years, I really have a hard time believing that you're going to spend weeks getting shot at in the crumbling rubble of your destroyed apartment building.  
  
I don't care if you don't think your vote matters, *vote anyway.*  

I don't care if you think you're participating in a corrupt system, *vote anyway.*  

I don't care if you think you're just choosing the lesser evil or reducing harm, *vote anyway.*  
  
Cosplay in your subreddits all you want, I seriously don't give a shit, it's embarrassing as fuck, but whatever, I get it, I used to have a ponytail, we all do dumb shit, but ***STOP TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE.***",32,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/swqimz/rant_long_i_dont_know_who_needs_to_hear_this_but/,1645324183.0,swqimz

media bias,PoliticalCompassMemes,Gun control is racist,"Gun control in the United States are often proposed by activists as a means to increase safety in our neighborhoods. Often they appeal to race by using minority neighborhoods where crime is highest as the places their laws would most help. Yet a look into the history of gun control shows and that gun laws hurt minority communities the most. Even if gun control activists are ignorant of this past, it does not excuse the fact that gun control was passed for racist reasons and gun control still has negative class and racial side effects.

Gun control in early America started out in the region with the most racial tension, the southern colonies. Virginia was the first to ban blacks and slaves from owning guns in 1680. As mentioned in an earlier comment, South Carolina passed laws to limit slave movement and slave possession of firearms. After slave rebellions, gun control would become even more strict with one example being the passage of the 1740 Negro act after the Stono rebellion of 1739. Considering how laws specifically justified their existence as necessasry due to black's "" barbarous, wild, savage natures"" and the phrasing of gun laws against slave uprisings mention “negroe or other slave” , there is a clear view that all blacks are slaves/inferior in the eyes of lawmakers. [1,2] After independence gun control did not stop as slave numbers increased. Local slavery laws and customs became codified with state Black Codes. These Black Codes piled on more restrictions. Louisiana’s Black Code, for example, forbade the mere possession of a firearm for any slave and requiring written permission on plantation property for hunting purposes [3]. We know that the states did not really have an issue with whites having the right to bear arms. The 2nd amendment was incorporated in several state courts in the early 1800 with cases like Bliss v. Commonwealth and State v. Reid [4,5]. But if slave states needed justification of disarming blacks legally, they would find a way. Arguing that the Bill of Rights did not apply to states, slave states would deny 2nd amendment rights to blacks. Cases like Plessy. Ferguson, and United States v. Cruikshank was also decided on this legal thinking. Even when the civil war led to the abolishment of slavery, Jim Crow laws would make it difficult to obtain a legal firearm for many blacks [22]. 

The Northern states are not free of blame either, as they also passed gun control with race in mind. Prior to the 1900s some northern states have gun laws (notably militia gun laws requiring gun ownership as standing armies were not the norm in the US at that time), but nothing as strict and disarming as the Southern states. That is, until the mass immigration in the early 1900s that changed Northern city demographics forever as many of these new immigrants were not Anglo-Saxon or Germanic like the earlier settlers in America. Instead, most immigrants came from Eastern and Southern Europe, whom many Americans viewed as more impoverished and more prone to crime. Tensions rose from this influx, with many Americans believing that these new immigrants from Italy, and elsewhere were not white (Irish immigrants were not considered white for many decades). This view would last for much of the first half of the 20th century, even in foreign operations of American businesses [6]. New York, a popular spot for many immigrants, saw the passage of the Sullivan Act, which required handgun permits, “the first “may issue” law in which police enjoy significant discretion to determine who should or should not be granted a permit to carry a concealed firearm” [7]. While the act intended to disarm immigrants, “who were thought to be a threat to the established white population,” the act would also affect African Americans as many were poor. Even if selective enforcement is not a legal practice due to the Supreme 1886 case of Yick Wo v. Hopkins, the public care, awareness and, focus on equal application of law did not occur until the civil rights movement [8]. Neither Senator Sullivan or the New York courts cared to hide their bias or hiding their discriminatory views. Senator Sullivan, who championed the Sullivan Act, did not expect criminals to be affected by the law, revealing that the motive to control criminals was not his primary motive [7]. The judge remarked to the first conviction of the Sullivan act, an Italian, stating, “It is unfortunate that this [i.e., carrying guns] is the custom with you and your kind (Italian), and that fact, combined with your irascible nature, furnishes much of the criminal business in this country [9]. The Sullivan Act is considered the birth of modern gun control. Pennsylvania would enact similar grounds to New York and pass laws that banned non-citizens from owning rifles and shotguns in 1909 [7]. Lawmakers were careful to use neutral worded language to be as general as possible to prevent any trouble in court, a trend that would be used for much of modern gun control laws. Their effort succeeded with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upholding the state’s gun control laws in Commonwealth v. Pantone [10]. These early 1900s laws and cases represent a standard view that resurfaced in the 1960s; any significant increase in crime was due to minorities with guns. Other  non-southern states followed with similar laws [22].

In the 1960s the civil rights movement started to achieve results but white American had to confront their belief in the wake of high crime rates. The destructive Watts riots in 1965 made clear …” to the average white law-abiding citizen, the riots also underscored the threats and dangers of living in a culturally complex, multiracial society [11]. Gun control attempts failed even after the deadly 1966 University of Texas shooting. What really turned the tide for gun control were civil rights groups like the Black Panthers. Despite all of their tactics like cop watching and open carry being legal, many in white America were not happy at the sight of armed black men. Police departments responded to Panther cop watching with increased harassment and surveillance on the Black Panthers [12, 13]. As the public became aware of these patrols and their legality, Representative Don Mulford drafted what would be known as the Mulford Act. The act banned loaded firearms near government buildings, unsecured firearms in a vehicle, and loaded firearms in a public street. In protest, the Black Panthers stormed the California state capital on May 2nd.The press was not often friendly either, with newspapers from the Sacrament Bee to the Los Angeles Times advocating for increased gun control in the wake of Black Panther patrols and the storming of the state capital building [13]. Furious over the “March on Sacramento,” the Mulford Act was passed in July, and police departments in California made the Panthers one of their top priorities [12]. While Republican governor Ronald Reagan signed the act, the act had bipartisanship support as it passed in a Democratic-controlled assembly and a Democratic-controlled Senate [14, 15]. Although the march itself saw no casualties and the only law that was broken was an obscure clause that forbade the interrupting of the state assembly, the actual ‘crime’ was elsewhere [12]. Unlike previous marches and rallies by civil rights groups, the March on Sacramento was an open armed message of defiance to the status quo of peaceful and mixed raced marches. The armed nature of the leftist Black Panthers also brought a fear of radical uprising and revolution in the Cold War. For southerners, it was an echo from the past of the feared slave uprising. The police arrested many of the Panthers before they thought of a charge. The Mulford Act was passed relatively quickly after the march, demonstrating the importance of punishing the Black Panthers rather than an attempt at dialogue and discussion [12]. With media and the American public aware of these radicals, police quickly increased their operations against the Black Panthers. Black churches were raided, and the FBI infiltrated the organization as part of its COINTELPRO operations [16].

In response to the rise in violence, President Johnson launched the war on crime. Instead of developing different nonviolent crime control methods or new riot prevention, the Johnson administration focused on targeting Black Power activists whom they thought were behind the unrest [17]. Unfortunately, as the War on Crime intensified, the War on Poverty took a backseat. Racist assumptions of the black community meant that the Federal government became more draconian in deterrence [17]. Police patrols, increased surveillance, and preemptive contact became common tactics. After all, if the police showed progress with these tactics against the Black Panthers, then it could work on other black criminals as well, reasoned the government. Isolating, containing, and arresting the criminal elements of the black community would bring African Americans’ back into society’ as their opinion of police was supposed to be changed from the new police programs. . However, the failure to address racist police behavior and laws meant the efforts were doomed to be ineffective. When Newark and Detroit experienced rioting, police and national guard reckless tactics inflamed tensions and lead to more violence [17]. For example, law enforcement assumed they were black snipers in Newark and returned fire, causing increased injuries and deaths [17].
Johnson, riding on a high tide of public fear, passed the Gun Control Act in 1968, believing that removing weapons instead of addressing underlying issues suffered by black communities would solve the issue. Among other things, Johnson banned the selling of guns to any marijuana/drug users (assumed black) [18]. He effectively banned the importation of cheap “Saturday night special guns” due to the strict specifications needed for importation, a resurrection of Senator’s Dodd earlier attempt that decade [18, 9].( The term “Saturday night special” itself is racist with the name being a reference to ‘[removed]town Saturday night”) [19]. Banning cheap guns was thought to deprive the means for urban poor (read blacks) of firearms with Roy Innis, leader of the Congress of Racial Equality 1991 remarking “To make inexpensive guns impossible to get is to say that you're putting a money test on getting a gun. It's racism in its worst form.” [20]. However, this law have much to be left desired. In a National Institute of Justice study, most criminals do not prioritize Saturday Night Specials as their preferred choice of a firearm [21]. The 1968 Gun Control Act was not the first time laws in the United States have done this, as Tennessee and other states had banned cheaper pistols to disarm blacks after the civil war [19]. Off the books arms confiscation through gun sales registration would happen as well [19]. 

Gun control allows the government to maintain a monopoly on violence to ensure it is the only one that can apply force legally. While some Americans feel less safe with large amounts of guns in their neighborhood, tradeoffs in freedom vs safety are a part of all rights. Even if criminals get their hands on guns, there must be a way for minorities to arm themselves to prevent discrimination that many have experienced in the past. A notable example is with recent and past controversy and discrimination by police on the black community, the police cannot always be relied upon to protect African Americans. As current gun laws were built upon the gun laws of the previous centuries , the racist effect of gun control remains even if many pro-gun control advocates are not racist themselves. At the end of the day, minorities in America are best protected without restrictive gun laws and instead have a guarantee on the right to self defense. In this era of technology, that right of self defense would entail being armed with modern weaponry, i.e. guns.

media bias,PoliticalCompassMemes,The Condition of Political Theory on PCM,"A cringe is haunting PoliticalCompassMemes — the cringe of political theory. All the powers of Redditry have entered into a based alliance to exorcise this cringe: circlejerking algorithm and ironic comment, strawmanning and agendaposting, illiterate teenagers and petty Reddit micro-celebrities.

Where is the post in opposition that has not been decried as a wall of text by its opponents with their positive karma? Where is the quadrant that has not hurled back the branding reproach of “yes"", against the more “based” illiterates, as well as against its cringe theory-posting adversaries?

Two things result from this fact:

I. Political Theory is already acknowledged by all PoliticalCompassMemes powers to be itself cringe.

II. It is high time that political theorists should openly, in the face of the whole subreddit, publish their views, their aims, their political models, and meet this nursery tale of the Cringe of Political Science with a manifesto of theories themselves.

To this end, Theorists of various quadrants have assembled on this day and sketched the following manifesto, to be interpreted in the Economic Right, Economic Left, Authoritarian Right, and Authoritarian Left political models.

**Chapter I. Politically Illiterate Teenagers and PoliSci Students**

The history of all hitherto existing political dialogue is the history of karma count struggles.

Free-thinker and propagandist, impartial commenter and agendaposter, centrist and partisan, based and cringe, in a word, good-faith users and shills, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in the flourishing of serious and authentic conversation at large, or in the common ruin of the marketplace of ideas.

Our epoch, the epoch of the politically illiterate teenage redditor, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified agenda antagonisms. The subreddit as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great bifurcations directly facing each other — politically illiterate teenagers and PoliSci students.

The creation of mass media, the development of the internet, opened up fresh ground for the rising illiterates. The creation of Facebook and Twitter, the rise of political interest in the common public, the extension of political participation to the apolitical, the increase in the mediums of disinformation and in information generally, gave to politics, to agendaposting, to demagoguery, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the politically illiterate element in the tottering PoliticalCompassMeme subreddit, a rapid development.

The old system of memes, in which subreddit production was crafted by niche political hobbyists, now no longer sufficed for the self-affirming wants of the new users. The agendaposting system took its place. The theory-literate were pushed on one side by the new teenage Redditor class; divisions of theory between the different quadrant users vanished in the face of divisions of karma in each circlejerk.

Meantime the subreddit kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even agendaposters no longer sufficed. Thereupon, stolen memes and the overlaying of funny colors revolutionized meme production. The place of manufacture was taken by the rapid, content-recycling poster; the place of the agendaposts by recaptioned memes; now the top posts of the day, the modern illiterate garbage.

Modern political circlejerking has established political illiteracy, for which the popularity of PoliticalCompassMemes paved the way. This subreddit has given an immense development to disinformation, to agendaposting, to clickbait. This development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of the subreddit; and in proportion as disinformation, agendaposting, clickbait and manufactured outrage extended, in the same proportion the teenager developed, increased its karma count, and pushed into the background every theory handed down from the political science tradition.

We see, therefore, how the modern “political” teenager is itself the product of a long course of development, of a series of self-reinforcing feedback loops in the tendencies of mass media and of Reddit.

Each step in the development of the illiterate political teenager was accompanied by a corresponding karma advance of that class. A directed class under the sway of the radio and television industries, a vocal and self-governing association in the internet forums: here independent degenerate anarchy (as in 4Chan); there respectable like-giver of family photo posts (as in Facebook); afterwards, in the period of the internet proper, serving either the middle-aged or the boomer as a counterpoise against political literacy, and, in fact, cornerstone of the politically illiterate in general, the “political” teenager has at last, since the establishment of PoliticalCompassMemes and of the political internet forums, conquered for itself, in the modern internet, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern PoliticalCompassMeme subreddit is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the theory-illiterate “political” teenager class.

The politically illiterate, historically, has played a most karma-rewarding part.

The “political” teenager, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all good-faith, nuanced, politically literate conversations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley scholarly ties that bound PolSci students to their “conversational peers”, and has left remaining no other nexus between user and theory than naked agendaposting, than callous “meme”. It has drowned the most doctrinal discussions of religious tradition, of intellectual enthusiasm, of peer-reviewed statistical study, in the icy water of disingenuous circlejerking and irony. It has resolved political worth into karma count, and in place of the numberless traditions of political thought, has set up that single, unconscionable theory — opportunism. In one word, for dialogue, veiled by academic and scientific allusions, it has substituted empty, uninformed, witless, ironic comedy.

The politically illiterate teenager has stripped of its theory every quadrant hitherto reinforced and sourced by centuries of thought and literature. It has converted the YouTube radical, the “both-sides”-er, the manchild, the meme maker, the unwary unflaired, into its politically illiterate companions.

The politically illiterate teenager has torn away from the dialogue its academic sources, and has reduced the conversational relation to a mere karma comparison.

The politically illiterate has through its exploitation of the reddit algorithms given a nihilistic ironic character to conversation and interpretation in every thread. To the great chagrin of PolSci students, it has drawn from under the feet of theory the good-faith ground on which it stood. All political theory-discussing threads have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new jokes, whose introduction becomes a karma count question for all users, by irony that no longer refers to theory material, but raw illiterate assumptions drawn from half-baked musings; memes whose messages are consumed, not only within their quadrants, but in every quarter of the subreddit. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the memes of varied theory, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the memes of unthinking and gratifying self-affirmation. In place of the old literate and scientific conclusions and source-referencing, we have disinformation in every direction, universal circlejerking of quadrants. And as in memes, so also in threads. The thread conversations of individual users become common joke-launching platforms. Source fidelity and utilization become more and more impossible, and from the numerous biased user assumptions and imaginations, there arises an echo chamber of political illiteracy.

The politically illiterate, by the rapid upvoting of all memes of self-affirming disinformation, by the immensely effective means of downvoting “walls of text”, draws all, even the most good-faith users, into intellectual laziness. The easy gratification of bad memes are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all theory text walls, with which it forces the users’ imagined commitments to legitimate discourse to capitulate. It compels all subreddits, on pain of algorithmic burial, to adopt the illiterate mode of conversation; it compels them to introduce what it calls “wit” into their midst, i.e., to become ironic illiterates themselves. In one word, it creates a forum after its own image.

The “political” teenager has subjected the discourse to the rule of the illiterate. It has created countless memes, has greatly increased the subreddit population as compared with the old niche club, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the internet from the idiocy of apolitical life. Just as it has made the discourse dependent on the illiterate, so it has made serious and semi-serious conversation subject to ironic ones, good-faith users on bad-faith karma voters, the academic theorist on the “political” teenager.

The politically illiterate keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the karma count, of the diversity of memes, and of serious ideas. It has agglomerated karma, catered to the worst common denominator, and reduced ideas to strawmen. The necessary consequence of this was political illiteracy. Diverse, or but academically-connected traditions, with separate perspectives, models, histories, and literature, became lumped together into one subreddit, with one culture, one set of meme structures, one upvoting userbase, and one subreddit front-page.

The politically illiterate teenagers, during their rule of scarce two or three years, have created more massive and more colossal karma posts than have all preceding userbases together. Subjection of Reddit’s forces to agendaposting, circlejerking, manufacture of outrage, clickbait posting, strawmanning, disinformation, political illiteracy, whole populations failed without a single compass test — what earlier userbase had even a presentiment that such illiterate forces slumbered in the lap of Redditry?

We see then: the means of dialogue and the structure of the compass, on whose foundation the politically illiterate built their karma up, were generated in politically literate society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of dialogue and the structure of the compass, the conditions under which the literate conversed and exchanged, the theory-referencing of PolSci students and the seriously politically interested, in one word, the politically literate nature of the subreddit became no longer compatible with the already developed algorithmic forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.

Into their place stepped low-effort clickbait, accompanied by a bad-faith and ironic conversation adapted in it, and the conversational and karma sway of the politically illiterate class.",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/ttotp4/the_condition_of_political_theory_on_pcm/,1648813943.0,ttotp4

Judge James Boasberg: Just-released investigative report reveals Boasberg family's millions in Biden-Funded NGO stakes, more insights into possible misconduct in ""turn the planes around"" case.","https://preview.redd.it/k1qm6wznu8gf1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=d94360dec202d20d9289f48c18e10c214d8b6a18

We conducted a months-long deep-dive investigation into D.C. District Court Chief Judge James E. Boasberg. Two nights ago, we released our 32-page report (pdf file here: [bit.ly/3U1nGFR](https://t.co/Ds7qhl4nep)) anonymously on Twitter (see https://x.com/WhoaFrankie323/status/1950331460918870035). But our anonymity, while helpful in certain aspects, hinders us from gaining wide dissemination of the report and its findings. 

The report sets forth a litany of under-reported or never-publicized facts raising serious questions about whether Judge Boasberg breached his ethical obligations by failing to disclose facts (or affirmatively recusing himself) about his immediate family's significant and conflicting financial/professional ties to various Trump 2.0 case plaintiffs and deep biases/subjective motivations hostile to the Trump administration. Every statement of fact is faithfully and scrupulously cited to (usually quoted verbatim from) public records or other reporting sources. The facts stand on their own and our anonymity should not present a reporting/diligence issue as they're all independently verifiable, most of them in multiple ways from multiple sources. 

We hope you'll take a look at it and assist us in getting it publicized. We are trying our best to get the report into the hands of the DOJ, because they are presently proceeding with a judicial misconduct complaint (that they filed with the D.C. Circuit Court just this past Monday, 7/28) against Boasberg based on relatively innocuous (relative to the findings in our report, anyway) complaint and factual foundation. 

DM us if you are interested in helping us get this report publicized, and particularly if you can assist us in getting it into the hands of the litigators at the DOJ.

based,conservative,ChatGPT o4-mini-high ranking of presidents best to worst,"I had to modify and repeat this query several times to exorcise what seems to have been an obvious bias FOR Biden and Obama. For example, it touted how in Dec 2024 illegal border crossings were the lowest since early 2020 (so he was getting credit for improving a problem he unnecessarily created.) Good lord. And it touted the Inflation Reduction Act without checking the actual outcomes of that legislation. It also at one point claimed Obama totally defeated ISIS (it actually reached it's highest power as a state during Obama and Trump defeated it.) Even after all this, it still insisted on Obama being high on the list. It also penalized some early presidents for having slaves, and I'm against overly judging people who in past eras were behaving the same as 99% of the population around them. It also put Trump near the bottom until I insisted on some of the criteria shown in the below query. I am currently paying 200$/month for pro and ran this query through o4-mini-high. I had to tell it to include Biden and Trump because at first it omitted them. It explained that its model was only updated to Jun 2024. (!?)

*Perform this query and I want to name it POTUS ranking. Rank all 45 men who served as POTUA from best to worst based on performance and positive impacts to the security of the USA, and the health and welfare of all citizens. In your analysis, avoid any reliance on c-span surveys and use unbiased news networks and wiki for data mining. Include Biden in the ranking. include Trump's accomplishments in both his first term and his ongoing current term in the analysis. also include accomplishments in the analysis such as ending wars, signing Peace Deals or reaching accords with adversaries. exclude observations regarding slave ownership and racism, however give credit for ending slavery or improving civil rights. include fiscal accomplishments such as improving national debt, lowering tax rates or balancing the national budget. Give credit for accomplishments such as improving border security or national security through maintaining a strong military. Include generally accepted, fact based observations of poor or good impacts on the us economy. penalize in the ranking those who allowed more immigrants to illegally cross the border more than other presidents. assume that the Inflation Reduction Act led to substantial failures such as failed green businesses and enormous wastes of us taxpayers' money. Award positive credit to presidents who successfully put down declared enemies of the USA such as the 911 attackers, ISIS and the Axis Powers of WWII, who fended off significant threats such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, or who added territory to the country. Do not give positive credit for recovering from the 2008 recession, because it's very likely anyone in office would have managed out of that crisis. Do not give positive credit for the Affordable Care Act because while it helped some Americans, it was extremely poorly initiated and managed, and turned out to be a socialist program that later contributed to US debt when enormous amounts of benefits were given to illegal immigrants. Once ready to report your results, recheck the list to ensure all 45 men who served as POTUS are on the list once. The list should be from 1-45; men who served nonconsecutive terms should be listed only once. Ensure your facts and ratings include that ISIS substantially grew during Obama's term and was defeated during Trump's term.*

Below is your “POTUS ranking”—all 45 unique men who have served as President of the United States, ordered from best (1) to worst (45) based on their combined performance in strengthening U.S. security and advancing the health and welfare of all citizens. Each entry highlights the key factors—fiscal discipline (debt restraint, balanced budgets, tax reform), peace and war outcomes (conflict resolution, peace accords, defeating declared enemies), border & homeland security (immigration control, military readiness), and broadly accepted economic impacts. No credit is given for post-2008 recovery or the ACA; the Inflation Reduction Act is treated as a fiscal failure; higher illegal-crossing rates incur penalties; credit is awarded for ending slavery or advancing civil rights, adding territory, and defeating the Axis Powers, 9/11 attackers, or ISIS.

10. **Barack Obama (2009–17)** Unemployment fell from 10 percent to 4.7 percent (no extra credit for post-2008 recovery) and he deployed advanced surveillance and technology to temper crossings; **ISIS, however, grew into a proto-state controlling significant territory across Iraq and Syria during his term** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_the_Islamic_State?utm_source=chatgpt.com), and had not been driven from half its gains when he left office.

31. **Richard Nixon (1969–74)** Ended U.S. combat in Vietnam; opened relations with China; imposed wage-price controls amid recession—though Watergate and rising deficits tarnished his record.

36. **Millard Fillmore (1850–53)** Enforced the Compromise of 1850—temporarily staving off civil war—but made no strides in fiscal or immigration control.
37. **Franklin Pierce (1853–57)** Negotiated the Gadsden Purchase for railroads; oversaw modest economic growth; and left border security unchanged.
38. **Zachary Taylor (1849–50)** A Mexican-American War hero who opposed sectional compromise, he died early, leaving minimal policy and security impact.
39. **Andrew Johnson (1865–69)** Completed the Alaska Purchase at low cost but was hamstrung by impeachment battles, leaving Reconstruction and borders weak.
40. **Warren G. Harding (1921–23)** Cut taxes under the 1921 Revenue Act but saw his term overshadowed by Teapot Dome and other scandals, negating modest economic gains.
41. **George W. Bush (2001–09)** Dismantled al-Qaeda’s core after 9/11; passed major tax cuts, but generated persistent deficits and presided over the 2008 crisis (no credit), even as he expanded the southern fence under the Secure Fence Act.
42. **Joe Biden (2021–25)** Passed a $1.9 trillion Rescue Plan and a $1 trillion Infrastructure Act, but the Inflation Reduction Act’s green-energy programs largely failed; illegal crossings surged post-Title 42, and deficits reached post-war highs.
43. **James Buchanan (1857–61)** Failed to avert the slide to Civil War; presided over the Panic of 1857’s deepening slump; and took no decisive action on borders or civil rights.
44. **William Henry Harrison (1841)** Died one month into office, leaving no substantive policy, security, or economic record.

based,conservative,"Are Tariffs worth the turmoil? short answer, YES.  Long answer:","**To my fellow Conservatives and to the lurking Dems thinking that these tariffs make the consumer pay more, buy less, hurt the economy, and drag down the stock market, you're 100% correct.**

But as I see it, there are two potential positive outcomes: either the tariffs are temporary and are being used as leverage to bring countries and/or companies that refuse to negotiate in good faith to the table (meaning the tariffs are eventually lifted), or they’re here to stay, in which case the resulting ""tax"" burden must be offset with other incentives that put or keep more money in people’s pockets. Otherwise, it will be a colossal failure that hurts the country and the Republicans in the long run.

Yesterday was Day 1 of the broad tariffs. Today is Day 2. Trump either cooks or gets cooked. Time will tell.

**And if you're thinking, ""Time will tell"" playing with people’s retirement funds and incomes is no way to run a country, lol. People don’t have “time” to just wait it out.**

The story of the country known as the USA already has a written ending, a bad one. The national debt will break this country sooner or later. Both Republicans and Democrats have made promises and done things ""for the people"". Some periods have been better than others, but the fundamental problem continues to grow.  The country itself is the one running out of time. We're speeding towards a wall, regardless of how “good”  the president in office may ""drive"" towards it.

I understand the worries, complaints, and pain this might cause. I'm not saying it's not real. But the same old, tested methods won’t change our course. The USA needs a different path. Otherwise, we’re just making the “belly of the beast” more comfortable while we wait for the very predictable outcome.

Most people think and act based on short-term gratification, I get that. I even understand it. But we need a different solution. So I think it's worth giving the elected president a shot at trying to fix things. It might not work out as he intends, but as the elected and sitting president, he’s earned the right to do things differently.

And hey, if it doesn’t work, the Democrats will win a bunch of future elections and fix everything, right?",738,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1jrq3mj/are_tariffs_worth_the_turmoil_short_answer_yes/,1743810094.0,1jrq3mj
based,conservative,Why doesn't the US become strong allies with Russia?,"I know I know - may be coming from a place of ignorance here but please help educate me if I'm off base. 

Note: I just joined this Reddit, and chose to post my question here because I wanted to hear from likeminded people. I am very much a conservative/GOP - looking through my prior comments on Reddit should clearly indicate that. I realize this may be a divisive topic but I am asking about it to broaden my perspective - not to stir the pot. 

Sort of began wondering this recently.

It seems like there is bipartisan agreement that one of the largest threats to America is China.

There is a lot of conversation about how China & Russia are not truly partners...

Russia leans way more towards capitalism vs. communism, Putin would do anything to restore glory to Russia, he could only benefit from US support. Russia does have natural resources & military resources, and a large population to buy American products - all items that can benefit America and give America a strong ally against China. Perhaps in exchange for support from America, Russia could improve its human rights violations and provide for more civil liberties to its people.

Can someone explain why this should not / will never happen? What other options does the US have to keep China from becoming a greater super power than us? 

By the way the last time the US and Russia worked towards a common goal we defeated Hitler and saved Europe... the mere threat of Russia partnering with the US had Japan preparing to surrender. Seems like it has worked before and they were not capitalists then.

based,conservative,"Mr. Trump, please use your administration's momentum for Tort reform in America!","The real blight on our economy is our absurd Tort system.  You cannot drive anywhere without countless billboards advertising Personal Injury Attorneys because our legal system has become an enormous mill that drains the economy from within.  Until an Administration is willing to do battle with the Trial Lawyers Lobby and enact some real changes to Tort law in this country, the U.S. Economy can never actually be '*righted*'.

Everyone will say, ""*It can't be done.  The Trial Lawyers Lobby is just too powerful and well connected.*""  Well, the public has said those exact words about a lot of things President Trump is pushing into the social conversation.

**First**: Don't try and make it a ""loser pays"" system like they have in England.  That'll never fly, plus it creates an unfair burden on Plaintiffs who may not otherwise have the means to pursue legal action except through a contingency based agreement.  Instead, **require Plaintiff's counsel ""*****put some skin in the game*****.""**  I would start with a system whereby the Plaintiff counsel has to secure a Surety Bond for 10% of the damages sought.  Heck, 5%.  *Something*.  Make attorneys have to really weigh the merits of their client's cases before they start sending out their complaints and subpoenas. 

Let the surety Bond market issue ratings for various attorney's offices whereby they have their own version of an ""Experience Mod"" (see: California Workers Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau WCIRB).  Terrible lawyers and ambulance chasers who frequently bring meritless cases will eventually be priced out of the market.  A little taste of their own medicine if you ask me.

**Second:** Give juries and judges some discretion.  **Give judges the ability to award up to 50% of the other party's legal costs** where real frivolous litigation is found.  Judges and juries *should* have the discretion to award the defendant a portion of their costs ***to be paid by Plaintiff's counsel*** through the aforementioned Surety Bond. 

**Third**: Root out the ambulance chasers: **cap contingency fees at 10% or** ***less*****.**  By enacting steps One and Two above, insurance carriers will have more reason and will to FIGHT bad cases.  The current system incentivizes carriers to ""settle"" claims because the longer a case/claim remains open, the more expensive it becomes.  This ""cost basis"" approach to claims management is what has led to a totally corrupt system where Morgan & Morgan, and Sweet James, and Larry H. Parker (and many others) know that if they file 100 lawsuits a month, 95%+ of those suits will be settled before every reaching a courtroom... or even a hearing; often before the first deposition.  The contingency contract the ambulance chasers have with their client (who is little more than grist in the mill) provides them with 30% or more of any settlement.  These firms can spit out 2-3 boiler-plate form letters, and follow that with a phone call or two, then typically get an insurance company to settle for tens of thousands of dollars rather than try and fight.  If we CAP contingency cases where the **maximum** the Plaintiff's counsel can charge is 10% of any award, again, these dirtball attorneys will need to begin to discriminate between real victims, and horseshit.

I want real victims to be able to find relief in our court system.  But our civil court system is now polluted with so much nonsense and bad-actors, Tort reform is needed.  Right now, ambulance chasers and insurance companies are the only ones benefiting from our legal system.

globalist,conservative,The Case Against Trump being the GOP Nominee,"Essay I found that covers a whole host of issues with Trump from those who are backing DeSantis. I know most people aren't going to want to read this. But it gives the complete break down of problems with a Trump candidate and just Trump in general. And before you go ""TDS, derp a derp"". I voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020. Nostalgia and martyrdom shouldn't be clouding your judgment. If anything bullet number 2 should make you question your support given what will happen. Yes, I also believe the the prosecutions are politically motivated. That will not change the outcome of what we all know is going to happen.

Anyways, hopefully people take the time to digest this. Though most likely it will be buried into oblivion never to be seen by the average subreddit user while I will get ""TDS"" spammed in the response. This is about the good of our country, which Democrats are determined to bring to ruin.

----

Here are the Top 25 reasons (version 3.1) most DeSantis supporters are done with Trump, even though nearly all of us voted for him twice:

1 - **He didn't deliver on his frequent campaign refrains**: ""drain the swamp"" or ""build the wall and make Mexico pay for it"" or ""lock her up."" 

The swamp got worse during his Presidency because he added to it. He made no effort to ""drain"" any of it. 
Remnants of the wall lay rusting along the border or have been sold off. Recently, Trump confessed there was no actual mechanism to get Mexico to pay for the wall. 
He let Hillary off the hook two weeks after taking office, saying the idea of it sold well before the election. As if that broken promise wasn't enough, a few weeks later, Trump invited the Clintons to his inaugural luncheon, pointed to them, thanked them for coming, said he was honored they attended, led a standing ovation for them, and then proclaimed, ""I have a lot of respect for those two people.""

Other Promises unkept: Trump DID NOT—Repeal the alternative minimum tax, Cut the number of tax brackets, End birthright citizenship, Enact 5-year ban on White House and congressional officials from lobbying, Impose death penalty for cop killers, Reverse China's entry into the World Trade Organization, Impose a hiring freeze on federal employees, Eliminate wasteful spending in every department, Place lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying for foreign government, Bring back manufacturing, Grow the economy by 4 percent a year, Add additional federal investment of $20 billion toward School Choice, Adopt the penny plan, Cancel all funding of sanctuary cities, Dramatically scale back the U.S. Education Department, Expand national right to carry to all 50 states (in fact, Trump went after the 2nd Amendment), Remove all undocumented immigrants, Eliminate gun-free zones at schools and military bases, Eliminate Common Core, Triple ICE enforcement, Get Congress to allow health insurance across state lines, Renegotiate the Iran deal, or Repeal and replace Obamacare, AND many other promises.

2 - **He will be embroiled in legal troubles throughout the general campaign**, will likely lose independents and the election, and I shudder to think what that does down ballot. He WILL be convicted in one or more of these cases. Getting a fair trial in a DC court if you are a republican or conservative is a unicorn. Trump is facing 4 criminal cases with 3 leftist jury pools in NY, DC, and Fulton County, GA. The idea he won’t be convicted is unbelievably naïve. Federal indictments have a 91+% success rate and Trump is facing two federal cases with multiple indictments. The first case in GA is a RICO prosecution that three of Trump's lawyers have already plead guilty to lesser charges and will be testifying. It is conceivable that Trump is convicted in GA by JAN/FEB 2024, perhaps before the Iowa Caucuses.
MAGA says they are all bogus and he will win on appeal. Again, this is incredibly naïve. The appeals process can take years and Trump would have to thread the needle on ALL of them to avoid prison time or house arrest.
But what does even one conviction mean to the GOP’s chances of winning the election? MAGA believes in “polls” now, so let’s go there. **A Reuters poll in August suggests that Trump could lose up to 50% or more of Republican voters if Trump is convicted**. That’s right, Republican voters. Even if this poll is half accurate, Trump's lose would be the largest landslide in history. This idea that everyone outside of MAGA (other Republicans, Moderates, Independents) would interpret a conviction like MAGA does, as ""political persecution,"" and vote Trump into office so that he could pardon himself, is ludicrous.

MAGA points to the current polls showing him in a virtual tie or leading Biden. Sure. These “polls” are 13 months from a general election. That's before the incessant drum beat for a whole year during the general, when ad after ad and the media attack Trump over these court cases and everything else. 40+% of voters are indifferent, superficial, impressionable, or are currently not paying attention. Do you think it was an accident that the DC trial date is the day before Super Tuesday? These people know Trump’s empathy appeal spikes his polls and they’re counting on you to feel bad for him and make him the nominee. If a convicted Trump is our nominee, we lose everything. It's a trap. Don't fall for it.

3 - **Even if he miraculously wins, he loses**. He might pardon himself for the federal charges, but what about the state charges? How will that self-pardon play? “The first President to ever pardon himself.” Good luck in 2026 and 2028 with that narrative noose around our GOP necks. If Dems win the House, they will impeach him again for one or more of these convictions. And what if he is actually guilty for even one of these charges? I hope not, but what if he did even one of the things he’s indicted for? How does that sit with you? Either way, innocent or not, it won’t be resolved for years, and it won’t change the effect. Even if he’s cleared of all charges, he won't be able to govern because no agency will work with him knowing they can just wait him out. Congress won't either. Why would they work with a damaged President to fix anything? Good luck cleaning house when no one will work with you. Who is going to serve in a second Trump admin? His chief of staff was indicted in GA. What quality people are going to sign up to serve if Trump is going to engage in even one questionable act that may drag them down with him?  Are we winning one or both houses? Good luck passing legislation without both Houses. Ruling by Executive Orders like he did the first time will be a nice temporary relief, but you better stock up for the next Democrat in office. Trump will be a lame duck the moment he takes the oath.

4 - **He's almost 80, and he looks all of it and unwell**. He’s almost 80 and running for the most demanding job in the world. Don't complain about Biden's age and then elect Trump. Americans have been retired for nearly a decade at this point in their lives. Old people don’t decline at a steady rate. They decline rapidly. Instead of MAGA telling him, ""Thank you. Well done. You exposed them. We got this. Retire and help us win,"" they're trying to martyr him and blow up the GOP in the process. Well, that isn't very bright. Unless you want to form your own viable party or tolerate the alternative, a leftist hellscape that used to be America, blowing up the GOP is not an option. The GOP isn't perfect, but it isn't homogenous, and it never will be. You must tolerate mushy moderates because 50+% of the country are NEVER going to be MAGA purists. I don’t want another octogenarian as President. Reagan had Alzheimer’s during his second term, Biden is a walking corpse. Not doing that again.

5 – **Trump is not a good judge of character** and frequently lets foxes in the henhouse if they stroke his ego.

6 – A very large number of people who worked with him and for him are not supporting him in 2024. In fact, **40 out of 44 cabinet members he hired are not supporting his 2024 bid**. MAGA will say they are all losers or RINOs he exposed. To that, I say, it's unlikely that they are all bad people. But if they are, please see #5.

7 - **Trump wasn't prepared when he took office and left hundreds of Obama holdovers in power**. These same people undermined him and his administration. MAGA always points to the unprecedented level of attacks, internal “deep state” pushback, allegations, and unnamed sources within the government undermining him. They fail to realize, acknowledge, or accept that Trump allowed most of this to happen because he was incompetent and unprepared to handle the duties of President. If you leave leftists in power, they will torch you the first chance they get. He didn’t admit to these mistakes and change direction. Trump left leftists and swamp creatures in power even as they undermined him.

8 – No matter how he frames it and revises history, after Covid happened, **he did everything Fauci and company wanted and signed whatever legislation Nancy Pelosi put in front of him**, including the Cares Act, which turned out to be the biggest tool of the 2020 vote steal. Certainly, no one knew the severity of the virus or the science of Covid that early on, and he couldn’t have known how he was being lied to at the time, but he refused to remove Fauci from the task force, gave Fauci an award on the way out the door, and basically ceded the management of the country over to the medical swamp for most of the final year of his term. To this day, he refuses to acknowledge his mistakes, defends the vax, falsely claims his vax has saved 100 million lives, falsely claims he couldn’t have removed Fauci, and claims he did everything right.

9 – **Trump spent us into oblivion during his first term**. Sure, Covid happened, but he was running trillion dollar plus deficits every year before Covid. There wasn’t a single spending bill Trump didn’t sign. He ran up almost 8 trillion dollars of debt (62% of which came BEFORE Covid), and failed again to live up to his campaign and administration promises. You can't print/spend/borrow 7.8 trillion above incoming tax revenue and NOT also expect eventual inflation, higher interest rates, and a devalued dollar. Look at your gas prices and grocery bill. Obama, Biden, AND Trump DID THAT.

10 – **Trump had the WH, House, and Senate his first two years and squandered his Congressional majorities**. He failed to replace Obamacare. He failed to permanently secure the border, because Executive Orders don’t last and the wall, finished or not, clearly doesn’t work on its own. He failed to address term limits in Congress. He failed to drain the swamp even one millimeter, which is probably the biggest, most impactful failure of all. He ruled by Executive Orders his whole Presidency, which Biden trash canned his first day in office. The ONLY policies/deeds of significance that remain from Trump's Presidency are his court appointments that he picked from a list that was handed to him and unpaid for tax cuts that are about to expire.

11 - **His obsession with loyalty always seems to be a one-way street**, especially if it means that his money is involved (i.e., J6ers, Rudy G, K. Mac, those indicted with him, etc.). These people “bled” for him and he trashes them or refuses to help them. He could have helped pay for non-violent J6er’s defense, he could have at least visited them in prison, he could have used his contacts to possibly make a difference in their treatment, or perhaps he could have even showed some meaningful public support for them. He did NOTHING. To this day, he’s DONE NOTHING. What he DID DO on January 6th: Trump held the rally in DC. He worked up his supporters into a frenzy with the belief that their election had been stolen. He said J6ers should march to the capital. Then, he then went out the next day and publicly called them criminals. He ultimately raised 250 million off the “Stop the Steal” campaign after the election and spent ZERO dollars to help pay for the legal expenses J6ers faced.

12 - **His ""airing of grievances,"" court cases, and whole focus is on the past**. I'm not interested in the past. Was it stolen? Even if you discount the suitcases under benches and trucks rolling in at 3 AM, state secretaries changed the rules without their legislatures and the media/gov/social media suppressed the HB laptop story, so YES, it was stolen. But, Trump lost, even enabling the instruments of that loss (Cares Act), he didn't protect the elections, and whether it was stolen or not, crooked Joe Biden is in the WH. Trump was in charge and he let it happen.

13 - **Trump DOES NOT have the ability to engage in meaningful exchanges where he explains and sells his choices, policies, comments, and governing philosophy**. He doesn't fight the narratives festering around him. Calling it ""fake news,"" while true, is not an adequate defense to keep the proposed narrative from defining you. You must attack the narrative and the premises under it with logic, reason, and voracity. If you dismantle the narrative or the argument or the loaded reporter question, you stop the media and democrats from selling their crap to the public. Trump is either unwilling or incapable of doing this, and doing this is extremely integral to getting legislation passed and winning elections.

14 - **He regularly punches down at people and engages in petty battles that mean nothing**. The list of people and organizations Trump has needlessly attacked over some perceived slight or his ego, using the public platform of his Presidency and 2024 candidacy, is too long to catalogue here.

15 - **He doesn't deserve the nomination if he's unwilling to earn it**. He is not owed anything. There is no such thing as ""his turn."" This isn’t a monarchy. Candidates who throw their hat into the ring are NOT “disloyal.” Skipping debates because of 'polling numbers' is entitled and indicative of someone who is afraid to defend his record or defend his reasons for seeking a second term. He is not even campaigning more than a few times a month. He spends his days golfing and rage truthing and making dozens of ludicrous video mini-speeches, as if he’s still President.

16 - He's a clever politician, entertainer, marketer, and businessman, but **his positions and principles are often for sale if the deal is right**.

17 - **Trump is woefully arrogant, a malignant narcissist**, and makes every single thing about himself. He rarely says ""we,"" refers to himself constantly in the 3rd person, and that says a lot.

18 - Trump's campaign is tangentially about the future, but that's not the main thrust of it. **His campaign is mostly about revenge and his ego**, not the good of the country. If he was thinking solely about the country, he would drop out, handle his legal woes, and help us do what he was unable to do.

19 - **Ultra MAGA, his cult following, not the persuadable, is nothing more than an identity group engaging in identity politics**. They are an identity group, just like BLM, feminists, LGBTQ, etc. They held up Trump as their champion because they felt disenfranchised, marginalized, and oppressed, and Trump was the force they put forward to tear it all down. At first, like many identity groups, there was validity to many of their grievances. The working class had been forgotten, the system was and is not working on their behalf. But unlike most identity groups, they wanted the existing system to begin working for them. They wanted a course correction. However, like ALL identity groups, their impetus changed and devolved into something darker and delusional. Ultra MAGA wants to tear it all down. They want a system that is right in their own eyes. They want to abandon the rule of law and exact ""justice"" on their own terms. Where their interests and the Constitution align, they embrace it. Where it doesn't, they ignore it. Ultra MAGA embraces and employs the tactics of leftists now. They are now what these other identity groups always were, militant grievance hustlers who ignore truth and morality and reality to serve their own ends. Trump is their vehicle, their champion, because he is the embodiment of their moral evolution. He was in 2016 what they've become in 2023.
If this battle is not about realistic policy goals and re-constitutionalizing our government, and it's about name-calling, tearing down proven conservatives and good people, and constantly lobbing hate and false accusations, we deserve to lose. We are no better than the leftists who do it.

20 - While the ""listless vessel"" comment hurt Trump’s cult of personality voters, DeSantis wasn't wrong, and it needed to be said. This isn’t name calling. It’s just the objective truth. **Some of these Trump supporters act like he’s second only to Christ himself and no matter what he says or does, they defend it**. They “feel” Trump. Trump is their persecuted, post-modern Jesus, a relativistic elixir salesman promising miracles, so they’ll find any excuse to validate their support and vote for him, even if he’s not worthy of it. I’m not sure where this comes from. Perhaps these devotees relate to his defiant demeanor, his grievance politics, because they too feel like victims of this economy and society and life in general, and they live vicariously through his full-throated “screw you” to the world. But it’s a cloud, some fog they all live in. Trump is not coming on a white horse to vanquish all their real and perceived enemies. He’s not going to deal some great vengeance on the deep state or lock all these bad actors up, for all the reasons I have already mentioned. Re-capturing our freedoms and our country can't be about one man.

21 – **Where is Melania? Where is his wife?** Between the court cases and his family, Trump has more pressing matters to attend to. His ego needs to take a back seat and he needs to step down for the good of the country and himself.

22 - **Trump thinks evangelicals are idiots, chumps** who can be manipulated because we are, in his mind, hyper-emotional followers of some sky wizard he knows nothing about. It was his recent speech in DC that confirmed this.
First, he bumbled through the issue of abortion for 3-4 minutes, repeating himself and talking about ""making deals"" on the issue. He's not seriously pro-life. He is not principled on any issue. His principles are for sale if the deal is right. In the recent interview with Meet the Press, he talked in a way that suggests he wants to apply the Art of the Deal to the arbitration of human life, and it was SICK. Making a deal with Democrats on abortion means ""Trump will sell the Pro-Life Movement out."" He didn't even push back on the lies of the interviewer who falsely asserted over and over that ""no Democrat"" wants late term abortion access.
Second, Trump told the audience that Melania was watching from home and that she called him about the persecution he is going through, but he has yet to explain why she is never with him anymore. He wanted evangelicals, who he believes are ""suckers"" for the concept of healthy marriages, to believe there is nothing wrong in his marriage when it is clear there is something wrong.
Third, Trump's team badly timed some hollywood-esque dramatic background music at the end of his speech and he faked a tragic hero act to swoon us, because he thinks we're all stupid saps who cry at Lifetime and Hallmark movies. Except, the timing of the music was off because he goes off script so much that the content he read had zero emotional value. He wasn't at the big closing, so the music and persecuted Trump act came off as awkward and manipulative. So, tell me evangelicals, are you as stupid as Trump believes you are?

23 – **Trump is NOT the fantastic leader people make him out to be**. Outside of a combative demeanor, maybe some courage and a ham-fisted level of delegation, he's mostly a barking entertainer. To this day, he NEVER admits his failures, he belittles people for any perceived slight or valid criticism, he lies about what he has said and his record, he praises and relates to despicable people, and he completely lacks the following leadership qualities: Communication, Empathy, Humility, Integrity, Emotional Intelligence, Creativity, Accountability, Learning agility, Self-awareness, Active Listening, Empowerment, Positivity, Honesty, Focus, Strategy, and the Courage to do what is right despite the political consequences.

24 – **Trump has always been an unwise, gaffe-prone, ego-feeding, insult machine**, and though it can be entertaining when he angers all the right people, it can be deflating and even harmful when he makes everything about himself and criticizes the people who support him and the allies who America needs to support. Recent example - While it is true that Israel and Bibi failed to secure their borders and protect their citizens, Trump did NOT need to harp on this obvious failure 4 days after Israel’s 9/11 scale terrorist attack. He publicly criticized Bibi, the IDF Defense minister, and then showed respect to the enemy of Israel, Hezbollah, as “very smart.” The bodies of our 25 countrymen and 1400 allies were not even cold. American hostages remain un-rescued. Trump lacks wisdom. He lacks timing. He lacks leadership. Right after the slaughter of innocents, Trump chose to highlight his personal issues with Netanyahu, and that is disgusting.

25 - **Trump 2023 is NOT Trump 2016, and it isn't even close**. Some of it is clearly his age. Trump spends his days golfing, rage-truthing, and delivering Trump PSAs to his iPhone in front of his Mar-A-Lago fireplace. In many ways, Trump is like my rapidly aging Great Uncle, who slurs his words, can't hear very well, screams at the television, and tells stories about the ""good ole' days"" where he is always the central heroic figure. My Great Uncle is entertaining, but I'd be nuts to take a single thing he says as fact or take one piece of advice he gives outside of how to make his eggs for breakfast. This is Trump in front of waning crowds in 2023—a disillusioned and delusional entertainer who tells every story with himself at the center, who rails at unseen enemies, and who hasn't yet realized that his time to leave the stage has long since passed.

**Conclusion** – Trump’s failures as President, his challenges in getting elected and governing effectively, and his deep and pervasive personal flaws leads to ONLY ONE conclusion - **Trump is NOT qualified to be our choice for President in 2024**. Choosing a path for our country that includes Trump in any role of leadership will lead to the ruination of the GOP and to a trifecta of Democrat power and every leftist law imaginable.

The Only Choice — DeSantis has all the leadership traits in spades. He is a much, MUCH better option moving forward. He's not an entertainer. But he is an honest, competent, highly intelligent, effective, and principled leader. He can also serve 2 terms.
RD isn’t “bought” a “RINO” or a “globalist."" Those people who try to use “guilt by association” ignore Trump’s associations with these same people WHILE he was in office and afterward (Ryan, Rove, Bush, etc.). Trump endorsed and is endorsed by numerous ""RINOs.""

DeSantis, however, came from a middle-class family. He's a veteran, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus in Congress who sold all his stock to avoid even the hint of impropriety. He rejected his Congressional pension because he believes government should be about selfless-service. He left Congress after three terms because he believes in term limits. He then became the best governor Florida has ever seen, delivering on every single promise. DeSantis is a family man and a fighter against false narratives. He’s also a 5-time winner who has done ALL he said he would do. He’s a relentless, shrewd administrator and leader who gives us the best chance to win and make a significant dent in the government bureaucracy.

The Presidency should not be a sepulchre for the aging politicians, family dynasties, statesmen, or even heroes of our time. 
The Presidency should not house the idols of our sports teams, films, or TV programs. 
The Presidency should not raise any man to the office  who might be esteemed to be more than he is, just a man. 
The Presidency should be attained by a man who is willing to put country before self, who has the energy to work 80–90-hour weeks, who does what is objectively and morally right, no matter the cost. 
The Presidency should be given to a man who has proven his honesty, who has delivered on his promises, who has fought his enemies and won time and again, and who has led with competence, integrity, humility, empathy, and effectiveness through challenging times and crises. 
Ron DeSantis should be chosen as our next President. There has never been a clearer choice. It’s simply time to turn the page on Trump. We have a MUCH better option.",44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/17gpi5x/the_case_against_trump_being_the_gop_nominee/,1698298961.0,17gpi5x

redpilled,conservative,Crime Rate Of Illegal Immigrants From FBI And ICE Data,"Whenever the right says “illegals bring crime” the left says “immigrants commit fewer crimes than American-born citizens,” answering a question no one asked.  
Here’s the right answer. The crime rate of illegal immigrants compared to legal American residents sourced from ICE and FBI data.

**Comparison of 2017 legal resident and illegal immigrant crime rate in the US per-100,000** 

|Crime|Legal Resident Crime Rate|Illegal Immigrant Crime Rate|Illegals commit the crime
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
|**Murder**|2.4|17.6|**7.3 times** more often
|**Non-prostitution sex crimes**|13.9|110.1|**7.9 times** more often

[2016 estimated illegal population](http://www.pewhispanic.org/2018/11/27/u-s-unauthorized-immigrant-total-dips-to-lowest-level-in-a-decade/)

Estimated illegal population was subtracted from total population to produce a population for legal American residents.

**Crimes**  
ICE deports illegal immigrants who have been arrested for criminal activity and logs crimes committed by these illegals.

[2017 US crimes](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/table-43)

ICE and FBI log crimes differently under categories with different names.  
ICE records convictions, criminal charges and their total. The FBI records arrests for a crime. For this data ICE’s total convictions and charges were compared to the FBI’s arrest records. 

|Data crime category|ICE category|FBI category
|:-:|:-:|:-:
|Murder|Homicide|Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter
|Non-prostitution sex crimes|Sexual assault and sex offenses|Rape and sex offenses
|Vehicle theft|Stolen vehicle|Motor vehicle theft
|Robbery|Robbery|Robbery
|Weapon offenses|Weapon offenses|Weapons; carrying, possessing, etc.
|Burglary|Burglary|Burglary

ICE’s data for arrests of illegals in each category were subtracted from the total arrests as recorded by the FBI to produce a set of crimes committed by legal American residents.

Crimes committed by legals and illegals were each compared to their respective populations to produce the per-100,000 crime rates in the first table.

libtard,conservative,"Came for like minds, left for like minds","I joined r/conservative because I have conservative views regarding family values, fiscal policy, states' rights, gun rights, and an appreciation for ""get it done"" attitudes and working the land.

After several weeks I realized 90% of posts here are nothing but lame excuses to state unfounded opinions (Kamala MUST be disrespectful if she said ""enjoy your weekend"" at the wrong time).  While people bitch about censorship, they are hypocrites who restrict the space to one ideology and shout down differing views, calling them ""dangerous"" just like the left does.  I got banned from the Qanon anti-censorship group for stating a ""controversial"" opinion that there is a reason for black rebellion.  How evil of me to consider the possibility.  I suppose that justifies being called a pedophile?  That's what you all say when you disagree.  Libtard, pedo, Joe Biden-lover, wants men to get pregnant.  Y'all step over the line, even beyond the complete disregard for critical thinking  of the far left, and into the territory of radicalized anger, hatred or intolerance.

Southerners whose grandparents were sharecroppers, working class people who feel their government is taking their liberties, join arms with your fellow freedom fighters and fuck this thread.

If you don't care about the power of the people, if you are a conservative who doesn't care about ending federal overreaches of power INCLUDING the Trump administration, if you are a conservative who would prefer the DOJ and DEA handle your problems instead of your local community, you're a sell out and a fraud.  Go move to Russia that you love so much so you can lick Putin's communist balls.  I imagine it's a step up from the boots y'all are licking in your authoritarian frenzy.

I also happen to understand and agree with some of the conservative point of views on various issues like immigration and gun control. However, i have felt that my republican friends in the 2016 and the GOP in general have moved further to the right and adopted a position of ideological purity where disagreement on a certain issue makes you a ""libtard"". Trump is an entirely different topic but even before him, the shift to the right was increasingly apparent on various issues and this makes me very uncomfortable about the future of the GOP in an America that is increasingly diverse. Please, if you can, explain to me why i should vote for the GOP in the future and how i am wrong. I would like a coherent argument rather than ""Oh buh emails"" and ""the libs did it too"".

libtard,conservative,My predictions and fears for the future of conservatives,"I want this to be a warning to conservatives because I fear we could fall into the same trap the the left did in this past election if we are not careful. 

Over the past 8 years of Obama we saw something miraculous, the intellectual powerhouse that was the left, lost its ability to argue its side and instead began relying on accusations of racism and sexism to get its point across. They used political correctness as a blunt force tool to censor conservative thought in the mainstream. These are by no means the only reasons the left lost this election, but that's not what I want to talk about right now.

My fear is that over these next few years we will lose the ability to argue our side the same way the left did. If the democrats start talking the issues, and conservatives respond by calling them 'triggered libtards' we are going to lose. 

Now, while the groupthink the left is currently engaged in will make it hard for them to recover from the identity politics they have become addicted to, it is quite possible the moderate left that still holds liberal values might take root as it's own party. We should support this, because the protestors in the streets are not going to give us a reasonable counter argument to our points. 

Ultimately what I'm suggesting is to not let Our recent victories go to our heads, we need to be able to criticize ourselves and our ideas to make them better. We need to hear the left's point of view, and consider their arguments. With Trump's attempt to 'drain the swamp' we have a chance to reshape politics for the future. I think we can do it, but we need to avoid falling into the same pit of non-intellectual BS that the mainstream left did.

If anyone wants to start a discussion about anything here leave a comment, I'm more than happy to respond.

traitor,conservative,"[Insider's info] As a REAL POLITICAL REFUGEE, I am CONSERVATIVE (by two real life observations)","Short Introduction about me: 
I was born in April, 2006. I am known as the activist “Fragile Bard” on The Epoch Times and Radio Free Asia. I arrived in the US on August 13th, 2022. The National Security Department of Hong Kong Police Force entered my home with a search warrant with the charge of “sedition”, after I posted videos criticizing Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party in February, 2022. The national security officer keeps persuading me to work for them and assist them with the investigation on other dissidents, in exchange the government can pardon me for my disobedience to the Chinese Communist Party. But I did not want to exchange temporary safety by going against my own conscience, so I fled. I picked the US, since it has the strongest military in the world, also US politics is basically world politics. I have a dream to join the US military (preference: Air Force > Army > Navy) and defend liberty and the US Constitution. For me fleeing is just retreating, and retreating is not giving up, I would not give up the task to uphold the founding values of America, shared by humanity. (BTW, I have registered for selective service. I hope that I can sign up for voluntary service as soon as possible. USA! USA! USA!)

Part 1:
When I arrived at SFO, I immediately claimed asylum status at the ICE checkpoint. Most of the officers were nice, especially when I was underage, but a Chinese officer was picking at me. She said that she did not believe in my story because I was young, and the Chinese government “would not persecute minors”. (Five teenagers have been sentenced to three years' detention in Hong Kong for delivering leaflets opposing the CCP. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63186293 ) I have a question, are the woke going to blame the Whites for a Chinese American speaking for the CCP with lies? 

Since asylum is immigrationally intended, it contradicts the condition for a tourist visa. ICE arrested me and gave me a notice to appear. They sent me to a “shelter” for minors run by an organization that is funded by the federal government which serves as a juvenile detention center for immigrants, minors ranging from 12 to 17 years old, are grouped together arbitrarily regardless of their backgrounds. Most of the detainees crossed the US-Mexico border, and came for economic reasons with plans to work illegally. (They overtly admitted it and were very proud of it.) Most of the detainees in the shelter are released within one to two weeks, and most of them are Hispanic. 

At least for my case, they did not really ask any questions about how I am going to obtain legal residency in the US, very likely not for those who are released quickly, I was not able to file an asylum application (form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal) in the facility, since my devices containing the evidences and passport were all confiscated. And my time in shelter is much longer than the national average according to statistics conducted by the US government. The only question I have been asked repeatedly is “Do you eat dog meat in China?”. The people who asked were the same group of people who were yelling that Trump is racist. I have also heard countless “chinito” and “ch*ngch*ng”.

(Latest UC data – FY2024. (2024, August 28). United States Department of Health and Human Services. https://www.hhs.gov/programs/social-services/unaccompanied-children/latest-uc-data-fy2024/index.html )

The staff and detainees are mostly Hispanic. According to ABC News, a lot of the kids lost contact, missed immigration court hearings, and despised the laws of the US. I was detained for three months. More than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children failed to appear for their immigration court hearings, which is even more than the minors released to sponsors in Fiscal Year 2015.

According to Freedom House (funded by the US government), only Nicaragua, Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela are “not free”, and overall they are still freer than China and Iran. Most of the migrants I saw in the shelter from Latin America, are not from the four mentioned countries above. 

https://freedomhouse.org/explore-the-map?type=fiw&year=2024 

If you are a real political refugee, you would not want your plan to flee, fearing that the dictatorial government might know. So when they flee, they probably do not have the time to find a trustworthy sponsor who is safe to know about the plan. The decision of whether a juvenile should be released has not much relationship with his background nor his eligibility to obtain legal residency like asylum. Also, if someone is a real political refugee who is granted the protection of his life and liberty by America, in common sense he would be grateful and want to be very American, at least learn English. But Most of the migrants in the shelter showed an attitude that they do not have to nor want to learn English. 

Ironically, in community college, my English professor let students write an essay about the book, Illegally Yours by Rafael Agustin, who was an illegal immigrant who overstayed in the US with a tourist visa. According to what he wrote, he was working illegally, he had once stolen a pornographic magazine from a store, and drove a motor vehicle without a driver 's license. He traveled to Tijuana and returned to the US while being undocumented. Yet, he received his green card. In his book, Agustin claimed that America plays the minorities and controls the Latin American countries by puppets. 

When the radical-left said that we should accept all immigrants because of sympathy, when did they speak for those who are really fleeing from the political persecutions of America’s enemies? 

When I expressed that I am unhappy in the incarcerated situation, the therapist under the NGO (her parents are immigrants from Mexico, she was raised in the US) made the following statements, “Who told you to fight for freedom?”, “The reason why you are here does not make you special”. She was so strongly opposed to Trump, that she does not even like to hear the word “Trump”. 

After refusing to the request from other detainees to make sexual comments about female staffs in the facilities, I started facing constant sexual harassment. One time, some 17 years old teenagers invited me to go visit prostitutes, the original wordings were “go f*ck mad b*tches with us”, which the weekly event was claimed to be leaded by staffs , after refusing it, I started facing constant rape threats along with accusation saying that I am a homosexual in a disparage manner. I was sexually assaulted with several touches (including direct and indirect) or observations of genitals by force. When the abuses happened, other detainees (again, mostly Hispanic) were just laughing. 

The one who led the bullying was from Romania, a country of the European Union, with democratic elections and freedom of speech. He decided to return to his home country since he does not want to wait, and returning is not dangerous at all. He was angry when he found out that I came by visa. He said that since I did not walk through the US-Mexico border, my life was not as hard as his. He also said that I was a troublemaker to my family that my parents did not support my trip and tried to turn me into the Communist Communist Party, he also stated that he “don’t give a f*ck” about my advocacy for freedom. He also praised those who were illegal entrants who were trying to work illegally in the US, even without license as electricians. He claimed that he was a drug dealer in Romania, and he overtly claimed that he came for money. He also blamed me for trying to let the Hispanic migrants learn English.

Those people claim that they came to the US because they are poor and starving in their home country. Yet, they are taller, and heavier and were able to bully an underweight political refugee kid. What kind of starveds are they? “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength”. Sex offenders and tall bullies are poor starving children. 

After three months, I was released to a Mexican foster family with three other foster kids, all are Hispanic teenage boys who can do chores well, the foster mother could not speak English fluently. After reporting a racist incident in the foster home, the foster mother was angry and expelled me. She did not make any defense about her racist speech against me. Radical left needs to stop blaming everything on Whites. 

Eventually, a white couple fostered me and gave me a home. When the school biology started talking about what is sex trafficking and how much sex trafficking happens in the US every year. I could not hold it anymore, I told my foster parent more about a lot of things I have experienced in the shelter. 

It is really hard for me to believe the leftists’ claim of “White men are the root of evil.” When the people abusing and mistreating me are mostly non-Whites, when the people who helped me a lot are Whites. If loving my foster parents who have loved me is considered white-supremacy, I am proud to be the first transracial White in human history. Howdy Y’all, I identify myself as a heterosexual, cisgender, Christian White male. Yeehaw!

Local police department reported the case to the California Department of Social Services, CDSS sent an investigator (also Hispanic) to interview me. The investigator told me that the system is handling too many kids and they can do nothing about it when I was crying, and the system should not treat better kids with better support because it is unfair. It is proven again that, leftists think migrating to the US is something everyone deserves, and those who can do it while complying with the law are just like, very similar to their ideas about “critical racial theory”, “critical racial theory” is unfair to Whites, completely opposite to the concept of merit-based. If migrating to the US is entitled to everyone, why do asylum seekers need to prove their case to the government? Tying economic migrants who have little loyalty and unwillingness to learn English with patriotic political refugees who have nowhere else to go is extremely unfair to those who fought for liberty while sacrificing their own family, career, school, friendship and a lot more. 

My social worker told me that the investigation had ended, but I have not yet received any results nor updates. 

In the three months in shelter, I was not enrolled into any public school district. I graduated high school in Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, one of the best public high schools in the US with a GPA of 4.0962 (weighted), with five AP classes. AP Calculus BC: 5, AP Computer Science Principles: 5, AP US Government: 4, AP Microeconomics: 4 and AP Chinese: 5. I was accepted by Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach and Bakersfield, but I could not afford the tuition. When I was looking for a scholarship, I was surprised that I could not benefit from the CA Dream Act, even DACA recipients are eligible. When I selected that I have a social security number and I am not a DACA recipient, the system said that they cannot determine my eligibility status.

The theme of this part is not about hating Hispanic people, but to raise awareness about identity politics. The thing that makes America great would definitely not and will never be about identity politics like “Oh! if you are Hispanic or Black, any bad things you do is because of the oppression from the Whites, therefore are justifiable. Of! If you are White, you are evil, and you don’t deserve what you have.” It is a shame to Hispanic and African Americans who worked hard. Same, if a Chinese American said that anti-CCP is racist to Chinese, I would strongly oppose that idea. I would not silently accept CCP supporters using the name of “Stop Asian-hate” to tie every Asian in America, to push their agenda that is going to benefit the CCP, and not liking to benefit the patriotic Asian, especially people from Hong Kong and China. Stop using the tag of “racist” to avoid data and facts. 

Part 2: 
Yuen Hong Tam is a young activist (I helped him while he is in the US) who has been actively involved in the “Great Translation Movement” which is dedicated to exposing China's inward propaganda and false information, as well as extreme Chinese nationalism including overt threats and schemes of violent attack on Americans on American soil. A Chinese student who is admitted by Columbia University claimed on Chinese social media in Chinese that he is going to “buy guns and kill Americans”, luckily his speech was translated and his offer of admission was withdrawn, otherwise a lot of Americans may die because of an avoidable attack.

I wrote a letter to House Reps. Michelle Steel (R-Calif.), Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), and Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). Only Michelle Steel replied. “As a Member of the Congressional Executive Commission on China (CECC) and a strong supporter of human rights, I’ve been working with my colleagues to bring awareness to threats posed by the CCP,” she responded. Actually I sent the message to Steel on her website. I gave a hard copy in person to Sherman’s assistant and Ted Lieu in person in an open event. Yet, I have not yet received a word from them. 

(Columbia University rejects Chinese student for hate speech. (2022, April 26). NTD. https://www.ntd.com/columbia-university-rejects-chinese-student-for-hate-speech_771036.html )

As China has severe internet censorship, the residents of China are not able to use foreign platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Instagram as well as western media websites like BBC and CNN. Therefore, the tone of China’s state media inward and outward can be completely different. For example, English media backed by the Chinese government would remain relatively neutral about the Russo-Ukrainian War, but the state media on Chinese platforms, writing in Chinese, outrageously support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If there is no one translating open-source Chinese information into English, the United States would be at a huge disadvantage of asymmetric information.

He arrived in San Francisco in March 2024 with a tourist visa, he claimed asylum during the entry checking. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained him and sent him to the detention center, Golden State Annex. On July 9th, an immigration judge announced that the immigration court has no power to conduct a bond hearing as he is an “arriving alien” according to the immigration law, because he did not cross the border illegally.

He is from Hong Kong, under the brutal rule of the Chinese Communist Party. He voluntarily put himself into risk to defend democratic values and to warn free countries including the United States of the coming, unknown danger. He protected America's national security interests without getting paid. It is important for Congress to support open-source translation programs that helped Americans understand both our allies and our adversaries. The Open Translation Act of 2024 (H.R.7942) suggested to establish a federally funded research center that will be charged with creating publicly-accessible translations of open-source materials (including speeches from government officials, official proclamations, and other documents) from China, Russia, and other nations of strategic interest to the United States. But under the unfair immigration legal system, as someone who did not cross the border illegally, and passed through the background check during applying for visa, he could not be released as easily as those who crossed the border illegally.

(9.3 - bond proceedings. (2023, June 23). United States Department of Justice. https://www.justice.gov/eoir/reference-materials/ic/chapter-9/3 )

Eventually his bond was set as $12,500 USD, which is unusually high for illegal entrants and actual criminals.

Tam’s case was used by China’s propaganda machine to defame the United States and suggest that the people under the Chinese Communist Party can only submit themselves to the CCP. Quote: “Absolutely hilarious to the extreme that you spread hatred, misportray Chinese people, simp for the extreme for the US and then they detain you for illegal immigration and you discover they don't treat you like a human being after all.”, “Never trust those who betray their own fellow countrymen.”

The definition of treason is to “provide aid and comfort to enemies of the United States”, in this case, such traitorous aid and comfort to CCP’s propaganda has been provided overtly. It is not reasonably possible that it is merely coincidence that the employees of the US immigration institute had mistreated innocent people who are beneficial to the US, and let people who are going to harm the US in easily. People who fought for American values and the liberty, safety and future of American people are being mistreated even worse than those who intentionally breach the law of the land for their self-oriented interest.",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1gmyone/insiders_info_as_a_real_political_refugee_i_am/,1731115433.0,1gmyone

I am not allowed to believe that Israel is a beacon of freedom in the dump that is the middle east, I think Islam is a blight on the world because throwing homosexuals off a roof for being who they are is a crime against humanity. I think someone who wants to invert their sexual organs is obviously a mental illness and needs to be treated medically not encouraged. I think every day the United States becomes less racist amdore accepting than the previous. I think that every law abiding citizen not only has a right but a moral obligation to excercise the second amendment. If what I am doing doesnt hurt you physically or monetarily leave me alone and I will do the same for you. I believe illegal immigrants should be deported one loss of American life due to illegal immigration is too much. Those who wait and do things the right way should be rewarded with citizenship.

This is what has made America the greatest nation this world has ever seen.

Just know that there are more of us out there than the people whose default reaction is to call everything racist amd shout down their detractors as fascist. I dont like Trump I think he is a loud mouth and ignorant but I can promise you he will get my vote as long as it can hold back the tide of these children on the left.",48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ch9qsn/perspective_of_a_gay_former_progressive/,1563982643.0,ch9qsn
traitor,conservative,"The Left has been lying to the American people for decades & the MSM has followed with lies supporting the undermining of our country. In a meeting of the Trilateral Commission, David Rockefeller bragged about how the media had kept quiet about the intentions of the Commission to the American people","In a 1991 meeting of the Trilateral Commission Rockefeller said this:  

**“We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time  Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our  meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty  years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the  world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during  those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared  to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an  intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the  national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.”**

The media’s silence on this is treasonous at best. David Rockefeller was even proud of the fact that he and his family were traitors. On page 405 of his autobiography Memoirs he states this: 

**“Some even believe we  are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the  United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalists and  of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated  global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If  that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”** 

\-----Again, media  has remained silent about these acts of treason because they are right  in the middle of it…

The editorial board of the Boston Herald published a piece on Monday titled [“Democrats and toxic media at their worst,”](https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/04/08/democrats-and-toxic-media-at-their-worst/) revealing how top names in the news business intentionally twist the president’s words to mislead and divide the public.

**“The left and its compliant media are willfully reporting false news to the American people,”** the Herald’s editors said.

**“Whether it is a symptom of mass hysteria that is the genesis for  this confirmation bias-style reporting or an intentional maneuver to  spread anti-Trump propaganda, its effect is toxic and pernicious.”** 

There was a time when what was reported in the newspaper was proper  information, relevant to what was needed to maintain a civilized society but that hasn’t been the case for over a hundred and fifty years. It  has become a publication for indoctrination into the leftist agenda.  Virtually all media has gone down that road.

Antonia Okafor, a young, single, black woman, recently discovered that she's a racist, sexist, misogynist. How in the world did this happen? None other than Antonia Okafor explains here in her PragerU video.  

#[Black, Millennial, Female and… Conservative](https://youtube.com/watch?v=MydjXCHoLo0)  

I recently discovered something startling about myself. It turns out that I’m a racist, sexist, misogynist. This came as quite a shock to me. How did this happen? As a person of color, a single woman with a graduate degree who grew up poor in a home without a father, I had a clear political path to follow.
And I followed it.  

I voted for Barack Obama...twice. After all, we share the same skin color. His father was from Africa. Mine was, too! What other reasons did I need? I was inspired to see a black man rise to the highest office in the land. I believed his ascent would herald a new beginning, a new era of racial healing and harmony. We would finally have that frank discussion about race that everyone always talks about. I was also inspired by his wife. I was thrilled to see such a strong, opinionated black woman take the national stage. But then something happened... actually, several somethings.  

I realized there was a big contradiction in my own life. I considered myself a free-thinker, but I was thinking exactly what I was supposed to. I decided to start asking questions. I belonged to several campus feminist groups. I was even teaching feminism to inner-city girls. Part of that teaching involved making the case for abortion. These girls needed to know that they had the right to make decisions about their own bodies. Surely, I thought, that’s empowerment. But one day I asked myself: Isn’t it men who benefit most from consequence-free sex? Doesn’t that give them even more power over women? And, of course, abortion certainly doesn’t empower the women it prevents from ever being born.  

When I began to ask my other feminist friends how they reconciled these issues, they just got angry. I was called anti-woman. Even by progressive men! “But I’m not anti-woman,” I thought. “I am a woman!” I just don’t want to be a weak one. I want to be strong – like Michelle.  

At about the same time, while I was a student at the University of Texas at Dallas, the UT Austin Department of African Diaspora Studies released a statement in which they said, and I quote, “African Americans are disproportionately affected by the saturation of our society by firearms ... We demand that firearms be banned in all spaces occupied by black people on our campus.”  

Wait a second, I thought. Why would you want to ban firearms only in black areas? Doesn’t that mean that you either think black people are more dangerous than other people, or less worthy of protection? These questions did not endear me to my progressive friends. I was called a race traitor...even by white people. But I’m not anti-black. I am black. I just want to be safe – like Barack.

I realized I didn’t have a good answer; I only had more questions – like, why were blacks doing so poorly in cities that had been run by Democrats for decades? Was it racism and sexism that was holding people back, or was it something else?   

The more questions I asked, the less popular I became. But here’s the funny thing: I started to feel better about myself. I decided that the very definition of empowerment required me to take responsibility for my own life. I wasn’t going to be anyone’s victim. Which meant I had to protect myself. So, I bought a gun. I started to advocate for gun rights. That cost me more friends. I joined the pro-life movement and walked in The March for Life. More friends...gone.  

Then, I crossed the line. I voted Republican – the party that views me as an empowered individual, able to shape my own destiny; not as a member of a victim group.  

And that’s how I became a racist, sexist, misogynist. I’m Antonia Okafor for Prager University.

patriot,conservative,Not sure where to start,"In my early adulthood I was a democrat. I turned independent until last year when I visually could.not compare myself to blue anymore. I have been through quite a bit and I never really turned my back on God but I did to religion if that makes sense. I still prayed before my meals and often even for my enemies and still I found reasons to not believe the Bible etc.  I am not on any social media platform besides reddit and YouTube (Snapchat for the wife's videos of the kids but thats it).  I use reddit and youtube to find solutions when I am stumped. So I hope that this still aligns with this page because I am not sure who to tell this to. Fast forward to three weeks ago. I work maintenance and I was tearing down a grinder. My coworker dropped the head on my hand. This thing by itself includes steel body, two rollers, gearbox and a motor. When they got it off my hand they told me they were afraid to look because they thought my hand was gone. My hand was almost instantly completely bruised and swollen but I finished the job and replaced the motor. I have absolutely no idea how I have a hand but I can't help but feel that there was a divine force. It made me start to wonder in a way I never have.  Even my coworker says it from time to time still when the grinder gets jammed about how he thought he was going to see a nub.......Then Charlie happened. His death shot through me like I have never felt for a stranger before. I honestly can't even describe how I feel but I feel like I have never been closer to God. I am not one to be afraid but this whole experience has shaken me. I feel free, brave,proud and I hold my tongue alot less now. I can't thank Charlie enough for the things he did for us and after seeing the WORLDS reaction. I just don't know. I don't know what Charlie's play was in the world but I am.now convinced 100 percent that he had purpose and it is not done. I feel something that I don't think I have ever felt and even my wife notices. So I vent here because. I 100 percent now know that I am standing on the right side. I think I may even belong . I feel like I can be a patriot again. I'm finding myself grateful instead of angry. . I don't even care if I get called names for flying my nations beautiful flag. I love it and I am proud of it. I wish it didn't take tragedy for all this to happen. Most of all. I'm glad to be here and I am glad to see the silent start to be open again. It has given me strength and I don't think that I have anyone else to thank but Charlie. I wish you all well and I hope this isn't the wrong feed for this.

patriot,conservative,The Flag of the United States of America,"To certain of us Americans, that flag is more than a symbol of freedom, more than a symbol of the nation who flys it, It is nothing less than everything we believe.

Foremost of those beliefs is Hope,the promise of every day being a new day to achieve our dreams.

Freedom to practice the lifestyle we choose, weather that be religion or not, we have the Right to choose.

Justice for all, it may not be perfect, it may be a bit broken, but it is the best we have.

Culture, some say The United States of America has no culture, I disagree, we are steeped in our history, our culture is one of speaking up for those who can not, fighting for a way of life no one else on this planet has, and strength of character to Stand for what we believe in.

We, the American patriots, will never rest, never stop, and never shut up, until everyone has the Right to live free, the right to criticize our government, the Right to speak out for what we believe in.

 There are those who speak against our way of life, our systems, our institutions, I do not have to agree with them, but I do support their Right to say it.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1lrxgln/the_flag_of_the_united_states_of_america/,1751675315.0,1lrxgln
patriot,conservative,On my disgust at the reaction to Brian Thompson's murder.,"“I have never understood why it is 'greed' to want to keep the money you have earned but not greed to want to take somebody else's money.” — Thomas Sowell

Today, the cultural climate in the United States and other Western countries has reached such a point that gunning a man down in cold blood is minimized, excused, laughed about and even praised, because that man was successful and prosperous.

The surface-level reason for this display is that Thompson was the CEO of an ""evil insurance corporation."" The real ""evil"" involved in insurance companies like UnitedHealthcare is the web of medical and labor regulations that make it impossible for ordinary people to pay for their own healthcare without seven layers of bureaucracy in the middle, each taking a cut and adding no value. But this isn't what people object to: the ""evil"" they see is that UnitedHealthcare is a profit-making business in the world of medicine, and not a charity. They would have even the pretense of a free market in healthcare removed, and all independent choice and agency replaced with a rationing central medical planner.

From a simplistic viewpoint, lacking understanding of the context around healthcare in the United States, it's easy for many people to accept the narrative of Thompson's villainy. To them, he stands for denying medicine to the sick. But that is not the real reason Thompson was murdered: it's only the reason he was the first CEO to be murdered in this way. Thompson's death is the consequence of the growing, increasingly ravenous malicious bloodlust directed at the rich, ""billionaires,"" capitalism, success and prosperity.

For years, the media has treated all right-wing views as inherently violent, while laughing off and indulging the increasing tendency of young leftists for bloody rhetoric against their enemies. We saw the result today. ""Eat the rich,"" ""murder billionaires,"" ""no one should be allowed to have that much money,"" and every other statement of envious malice, with more or less concealed threats, is not just rhetoric. If it continues to be allowed, it will soon be reality.

(And, I want to emphasize, saying that someone should not be ""allowed"" to have their own wealth *is* a hidden threat.)

There is a certain poetry in the fact that this event occurred as the jury was deliberating on the verdict in the killing of Jordan Neely. Comparing the public reactions to each death paints a chilling picture of the values our society has adopted.

The murder of Thompson is easier for the public to accept than the murder of someone like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos — for now. But this growing cancer of envy and hatred will not go away unless it is challenged directly, and it will continue unless we have the courage, the moral strength and the knowledge to stop it. The right *must* reclaim the moral high ground.

This means understanding that the freedom to earn as much wealth as possible is the essence of the United States, its success, its happiness and its future. Conservatives' growing rejection of liberalism (in the classical sense) is a deadly concession to America's enemies. 

If you are a freedom-loving patriot, if you take pride in your work and your ability as as a provider, if you trust your own judgment and don't want the government to run your life, then every attack on ""billionaires,"" CEOs and capitalism is an attack on *you*. The system of rights, freedoms and values that makes your success possible is what makes billionaires possible. This hateful mob despises success and independence, and are only attacking its most prominent examples first. When they run out of rich to eat, they will not restrain themselves from eating you.

Defend yourself by giving yourself a moral and economic education. Read Ayn Rand, read Thomas Sowell, read John Locke and the Founding Fathers. Know how to counter this garbage when you hear it, and don't ever hesitate to call it what it is: violent, hateful, envious provocations by self-loathing cowards who would rather destroy everything that makes their comfortable lives possible than confront their own inability to produce anything of value. It is not funny and it is not acceptable. ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1h70uri/on_my_disgust_at_the_reaction_to_brian_thompsons/,1733373002.0,1h70uri
patriot,conservative,What the US gets for aiding Ukraine," 

While looking at this sub on the topic of Ukraine i have often heard the question how does giving aid to Ukraine help the US.

This is an understandable question that often isnt explained well enough, i thought i could present a couple reasons why it would be useful for the US and it's citiziens to do this and have a civil discussion on the pros and cons.

1 First lets talk about the aid itself. The argument in itself can sometimes be pretty confusing on the amount and destinary of this aid.  
I have often heard people talk about 113 bilion of US aid to Ukraine, this number though is not very accurate because it contains both actual aid to Ukraine and a lot of war related expenses who are only partially connected to the aid to Ukraine itself, this number therefore includes things that go from equipment, logistics and pay of troops who were sent to Europe following the invasion, to funds to government branches responsable for preserving sanctions and avoid their busting.

The actual amount who was sent to Ukraine as of 19 January 2024 is 70 bilion in total US aid to Ukraine, 46.6 bilion is therefore the actual military aid to Ukraine (as you can see at the end of the graph it specifies that this is the actual aid without the other war related expenses).

[https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-aid-has-us-sent-ukraine-here-are-six-charts](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-aid-has-us-sent-ukraine-here-are-six-charts)

&#x200B;

That said even this 46 bilion are not really 46 bilion in cash like some people have mistakenly reported.  
This aid is roughly divided in two parts, the relatively modern equipment especially ammunition and the oldie but goody. The old equipment is the main type of equipment sent to Ukraine, this includes famous aid like abrams, Bradley and mrap, M39 Block I Atacms.

All this systems were and mainly still are sitting in US storages awaiting the end of their service life and utility, a service life or end of usefulness that for most of this equipment is quite close.

This equipment is in all likelihood not going to be useful to the US army, since unless the situation is really desperate this vehicles simply won’t cut it against lets say defending Taiwan against China, especially not with the procurement problem i am about to mention.

Considering the age of the equipment the US would have to be really desperate to send freshly trained troops in decades old equipment and if it has the time to train new tank crews there will also have been the time to set up factories sufficient to create something that wouldnt be a coffin.

Also while an impressive sum this isnt an incredible weight for the US economy, with it representing an expenditure of 0.32% of US GDP in total aid on the war so far, not a State changing amount.

The next question is what has this aid done then? Has it significantly impacted the Russian army?  
The answer is a clear yes.

Recently as you probably know the US provided information about the amount of losses of Russias pre war army where it states that Russia lost 87% of its pre war army, this considering both personell and general equipment (there are some big exceptions like aircraft), this obviously only means combat personell and the number prior to the invasion.

You might understandably be skeptical of this numbers, but while a little on the high side of estimate for personell lost this number coincides very well with the visually identified losses of Russian equipment we posses and with previous US leaks.  
Obviously in 2 years Russia has managed through moving to a war time economy and through the sacking of their soviet equipment inheritance to mantain an army in Ukraine, but theres no doubt that it has been a severe damage to Russia and especially to its original military.

Orxy losses of Ukraine and Russia as of January 2

There is obviously a margin for error, but its usually underreporting instead of the opposite.

[https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/12/12/us-intel-says-315k-russian-casualties-in-ukraine-congress-source-a83402](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/12/12/us-intel-says-315k-russian-casualties-in-ukraine-congress-source-a83402)

There is a last aspect though that too many people are ignoring, and that is that the west (Europe especially but also the US) has fundamentally forgotten what is needed in a serious peer to peer war.

The US since the 1990s has been fighting mostly insurgency conflicts, letting the formidable apparatus that allowed it to triumph in ww2 to rust.

This is especially clear in the ammunition and missile compartment, Ukraine used the javelin to a devastating effect as shown by armoured russian losses, but their production rate isnt sufficient to keep up with an attritional war, same but worse can be said of most ammunition and artillery shells. The pre 2022 US was producing 168 thousand shells yearly, in 1990 9 milion, at the moment giving 2 milion shells to Ukraine and Israel is already becoming a challenge.

Same for Patriot missiles, with a yearly production of 500 (now more but not by a lot) even assuming that every single shot was a success thats still not a number that can efficiently keep up with use against a near peer enemy like China or even a smaller one (Iran or Russia) and as we saw solely relying on stocks is very foolish.

Similar problems are present in many US and European weapon systems, that while very efficient, simply lack the numbers or the ammunition for a serious war.

[https://politi.co/3NbMq9s](https://politi.co/3NbMq9s)

[https://breakingdefense.com/2023/11/on-atacms-for-ukraine-dont-settle-for-a-job-half-done/](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/11/on-atacms-for-ukraine-dont-settle-for-a-job-half-done/)

Continuing on this note the US is partially ignoring the mass production of cheap drones and the possible counter to them.  
In the war of Ukraine we are seeing an increasing production of drones on boths sides, though especially Russia, that will arrive in the hundreds of thousands or more.

From recon drones, to 2000 dollar cheap kamikaze drones, to vehicle hunting drones the variety like the number is big and they always cost less then their intended mark.

While the US has in some way expanded its antidrone capability its still behind compared to the number of drones and the cost of shooting them down, for exemple in the lack of ground based EW capabilities which would find in Ukraine a perfect testing ground.

Its useless to have 100 bilion nuclear missile programs or 300 bilion jets (excellent jets but still) if you dont have the ammo for artillery or enough missiles for Patriots or drone defense.

TLDR: The US lacks a lot of relatively cheap mass for a conventional war, especially ammunition from artillery shells, to to patriot missiles, its useless to have incredibly costly systems while ignoring more basic things that foremost the US but also Ukraine needs.

Please dont only read the TLDR, thx.

\-There is a last key aspect of producing all this ammo and equipment people forget, that its almost all produced in the US incentivizing US jobs. Its money spent in the US, on US citiziens and US industries, this is especially true for the US$ 60 billions package.

Here is a map which States would gain most from the new package.

file:///C:/Users/Alex%20Zamparelli/Downloads/Ukraine%20Infographic\_22NOV2023\_v2.pdf

There is also the fact that from a national economic perspective the US economy gains slightly more that what you spend on the equipment by attracting and creating skilled workers which end up working in various industries (its a little more complicated then this but the gist is for every dollar spent on most US weapon systems the general economy gains 1.1/1.2 ecc dollar back)

Finally i would like to face the criticism that the EU is not pulling its weight in this conflict, while this was definitely true in the beginning now the total EU aid is more then the US aid, without counting the cost of sheltering Ukrainian refugees and reducing the gas import.

With the total amount, mostly financial, committed of 133.2 bilions, the EU is gearing up for war but it will take some time.

2 Advantages of Russia getting beaten or at least contained to the current position while having to sign and respect a treaty

\-Weakened Russia means less weapons to China in a war of attrition or for any other enemy of the US be it North Korea or Iran.

\-no nuclear intel and capabilities shared with North Korea, Iran or other nations.

Russia has clearly grown some ties with Iran and North Korea, both nations who fondly desire acquiring or growing their own nuclear capabilities, and there are various signs Russia has alreadt helped in part and will probably help more, unless they would be forced to avoid this thought treaties and constant checkups.

\-less military intel shared with the same countries and China. Battlefield intel and new systems born from the war are precious, would be good if they remain as much as possible in Russia and not in Iran.

\-As cynic as it sounds superiority of US weapons compared to Russian weapons will diminish their sales and faith in post Soviet equipment while giving US weapons the assurance to work in a serious war

\-new battlefield intelligence of equipments performance, being able to test your equipment in real conflicts before you might face a direct confrontation is incredibly valuable. From testing anti drone weapons, to countermeasures against large mine fields to knowing how capable the patriot is at intercepting hypersonic missiles is not something the US can easily test at home, some systems like the Patriot can use that intel to directly improve during the conflict.

\-If the war doesnt end badly the US will gain an ally for life, the same way helping South Korea and Israel made them permanent allies.

Cons, disadvantages of the US abbandoning Ukraine

If the US abbandons Ukraine without any time to transition, Ukraine will probably be able to continue for some time with the help of some select allies while having to slowly but surely give up territory to not get overwhelmed until they probably break and Russia arrives to Kiev.  
This will mean

\-Many international acts will feel emboldened by this victory of Putin and lack of US will, which could start many small fires and conflicts, we have already seen a taste of this with an increase of wars over the continent.

\-There would be no leverage to convince Russia to play well and not aid in the aforementioned way all the enemies of the US (Iran, China, North Korea ecc).

No leverage to stop its hybrid war too that goes from cyber to weaponizing immigration (till now only in Europe, though wagners presence in Africa and Middle east could change that)

\-US allies around the globe will doubt the US committment and if their bonds are worth it. From Israel, to Taiwan and most nations around China will understandably ask why they should side with the US in a potential war if mid conflict the US is going to backtrack.

\- A possible spillovers of the war to neighbouring countries like Moldavia and Georgia and possibly (though not very probable) even Romania and Poland, with Poland probably being the only one who would gladly charge into Ukraine Ussar style.

This would also bring

A guerrilla warfare and a lot higher civilian casualties then present day

B a Wave of migration from Ukraine to Europe and a smaller wave to the US, this could worsen if the lack of Ukrainian grain that at the moment reaches some third world countries pushes other smaller migration.

C a deep sentiment of distrust from Baltic and Slavic countries of the US reliability and its promises

\-Russia would get out of this with a more experienced army and the justification to continue putting copious resources into it, possibly also by extracting the resources out of Ukraine (heavy taxes or sacking)

But lets assume that you are someone who just wants the war to end sooner rather then later preferably at a low cost for the US and Ukraine. At the moment Russia is clearly counting on the west abbandoning Ukraine to then slowly grind Ukraines will and people away, this hope means they are not ready to negotiate, not even along the current frontline. If Russia sees a determined west ready to back Ukraine its a lot more likely it will be willing to negotate a peace deal or a truce.

Many people have the wrong perception that this money is just thrown somewhere, at the end its money spent in the US for the US and its intrests.

Big TLDR: The aid to Ukraine is a lot less then most people think, it has achieved significant gains and supporting Ukraine more would be in the best intrest for all americans.

Have a good day

patriot,conservative,Please donate to Trump to pay for his likely 350 million fine in the NY fraud case,"The closing remarks today in the Trump fraud case brought by corrupt liberal AG Leticia James will bring an end to the case. Many legal pundits in the LSM (lame stream media) and also reputable media outlets including FOX, Newsmax and OAN believe that corrupt judge Arthur Engoron will very likely impose fines to the Trump business network of 350 million. This is unjust and unfair and will certainly be reversed and likely (according to Fox legal analysts) lead to firing and disbarment of judge Arthur Enhoron (D-NY) after the conservative supreme court gets it on appeal. The problem is Trump would need to pay the 350 million dollar fine first before he can formally appeal.  While Trump is a billionaire he reportedly does not have 350 million dollars cash on hand “liquid) as most of his money is tied to his very successful 5 star resorts and other very generous philanthropic ventures. As and aside Trumps chief legal counsel Alina Hanba is expected to be on Fox to blast Engoron and Leticia James. Can’t wait for that.  

My plea is for all patriots of this country to please donate as much money as possible (use credit cards or even take out a HELOC) to Trumps campaign to pay for this fine so he can appeal and get the Verdict overturned and get Engoron and James disbarred.  When not if the verdict is overturned the money will then be filtered I’m assuming to Trumps general legal counsel fund to vigorously defend him against all of the other  illegitimate, corrupt and unjust politically motivated charges against him.  

Trump needs us to help him fight tyranny. When he is elected in November it will be glorious to be under his rule again and eating popcorn as he demolishes the Democratic Party and gets Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Shumer l, Barack Obama,Chris Christie, Jack Smith, Fani Willis, Bill Barr, Joe Scarborough and his very unattractive wife Minkha all placed in jail and/or get fired from their jobs.

 The Heritage Foundaton’s Project 25 brilliant restructuring of the Constitution and reorganizing the branches of government to direct power and ultimate decision making power to the President with little to no power of the other branches of government to interfere will expedite what the American people want to restore the fabric of conservative values to make America great again.

patriot,conservative,List of Trump's top 35 policies and achievements.,"People love to hate Trump (mainly as a person), but seldom look at his political decisions.  I dare anyone to come up with a list for Biden's admin. I tried, it's a laughable mix of horrible policy and virtue-signaling nonsense.

1. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017): Proponents of this legislation position it as one of the most substantial achievements of Trump’s presidency. Implemented in 2017, it lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and also led to most individuals receiving tax cuts initially. Supporters argued this would stimulate economic growth by increasing corporations' available capital for investments, accelerating job creation, and benefitting workers with increased wages.
2. First Step Act (2018): Passed in December 2018, this criminal justice reform bill received bipartisan support. It aimed to make federal sentencing laws less harsh, reduce recidivism through various programs, and improve prison conditions.
3. Repeal of Net Neutrality Regulations (2017): This controversial decision was hailed by supporters as an example of reducing government overreach and promoting free market principles. They argue that the internet thrived without these regulations prior to their introduction in 2015, and removing them would incentivize investment in infrastructure and technology.
4. Deregulation: The Trump administration prided itself on cutting down regulations across many sectors. Supporters claim that this freed businesses from unnecessary red tape, encouraging economic growth.
5. Criminalizing Animal Cruelty: President Trump signed a bipartisan bill into law making animal cruelty a federal crime in 2019.
6. Operation Warp Speed: Announced in May 2020, this program sought to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.
7. Right to Try Act (2018): Allows terminally ill patients access to experimental therapies not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
8. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA): Signed into law January 2020, replacing NAFTA, this agreement updated trade relations between the three countries with modern provisions regarding digital trade and environmental practices that were not present in the original agreement.
9. Recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's Capital: Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017—an important diplomatic shift aimed at bolstering U.S.-Israel relations.
10. National Defense Authorization Act (2020): This act established the Space Force, the first new military service since 1947. The Space Force is intended to maintain U.S. dominance in space in response to competition from Russia and China.
11. VA MISSION Act (2018): A comprehensive reform of the Department of Veterans Affairs, broadening veterans' access to private sector healthcare, expanding benefits for family caregivers, and improving the department's infrastructure.
12. Rebuilding the Military: During his term, Trump advocated for substantial increases in defense spending. Supporters argue that this was necessary to ensure military readiness and national security.
13. Regulatory Reform Task Force (2017): Each federal agency was ordered to create a task force to review and potentially repeal existing regulations. Proponents view this as a positive step toward reducing bureaucratic intervention in business operations.
14. Executive Order on Improving Price Quality Transparency (2019): This order required healthcare providers and insurers to disclose rates negotiated between insurers and hospitals in advance, aimed at boosting transparency in healthcare pricing.
15. U.S.-China Phase One Trade Deal (2020): This agreement led China to commit to purchasing an additional $200 billion worth of U.S. goods over two years, providing temporary relief amid ongoing trade tensions.
16. Appointment of Conservative Judges: Over his term, President Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices along with numerous federal judges, shaping the ideological makeup of the judiciary system for years to come. Including the repealed Roe vs Wade and the saving of thousands of lives.
17. Energy Independence: The U.S became a net exporter of oil under Trump’s term which made America energy independent.
18. Prison Reform: A landmark bill titled 'First Step Act' was signed into law easing mandatory minimum sentences on some offenses and improving prison conditions overall.
19. Under the Trump Administration, there was a record-low unemployment rate before the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an unemployment rate of 3.5%, the lowest it had been since 1969.
20. Pharmaceutical Price Controls: In July 2020, President Trump signed four executive orders with the aim to reduce prescription drug prices. The policy included initiatives like allowing certain drugs to be imported from other countries and providing insulin and EpiPens at discounted rates to low-income individuals.
21. Allowing states to add work requirements to Medicaid: This controversial move is seen by proponents as helping to ensure that only those truly in need use these services, and encouraging more beneficiaries to seek employment.
22. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also doubled the standard deduction thereby simplifying tax filing process for many Americans.
23. Combatting Opioid Abuse: During the Trump Administration, considerable federal resources were dedicated to fighting opioid abuse including increased funding for opioid disorder research, overdose reversal drugs and treatment options for those struggling with addiction.
24. School Choice Funding: Trump's proposed FY2021 budget increased funds for school choice programs by $5 billion annually, promoting educational opportunities for children in low-income families.
25. Repealing Obamacare’s Individual Mandate: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017) effectively eliminated this mandate which required most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. Supporters seen it as win for individual freedom.
26. Launching the Artemis Program: The program initiated by NASA under the Trump administration aims to land ""the first woman and the next man"" on the Moon by 2024.
27. Opportunity Zones Program: Established by Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017), allowed investors to defer or eliminate taxes on capital gains if they invest in designated economically distressed communities; goal was poverty reduction and economic revitalization.
28. Comprehensive Energy Strategy: The Trump administration expanded domestic energy production, rolled back regulations on fossil fuel industries, approved key infrastructure such as Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and exited the Paris Climate Agreement - steps hailed by supporters as boosting U.S. energy independence.
29. Executive Order Enhancing State and Local Involvement in Refugee Resettlement (2019): This order required both state and local governments' consent before refugees could be resettled in their jurisdictions, empowering local governance participation in immigration policies.
30. Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health (2019): This was aimed at improving the lives of individuals with kidney diseases and reducing healthcare costs related to treatment. It proposed changes in kidney disease treatment, including emphasizing preventive measures, more at-home dialysis, and ramping up support for transplantation.
31. Support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs): In December 2019, President Trump permanently funded HBCUs by signing the Future Act into law, committing nearly $255 million annually.
32. Food and Drug Administration Reform: The Trump administration claimed to have accelerated drug and generic approvals at the Food and Drug Administration, potentially leading to cost savings for consumers.
33. The Farmers to Families Food Box Program: This program, launched in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed to provide fresh and nutritious food to families in need while also supporting American farmers and ranchers. The program delivered millions of food boxes to families, including those in marginalized communities.
34. The Executive Order on Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping: This order, issued in September 2020, aimed to promote unity in the federal workforce and among federal contractors by prohibiting training that implies that one race or sex is inherently superior to another. While controversial and seen by critics as an attack on diversity training, proponents argue it promotes equality and combats divisive stereotypes.
35. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP): As part of the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this program provided loans to help small businesses keep their workers on the payroll. This was particularly beneficial for marginalized communities where small businesses play a crucial role in the local economy.
36. The Abraham Accords (2020): This was a significant foreign policy achievement where the Trump administration helped broker peace agreements between Israel and several Arab nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco.
37. The creation of the 1776 Commission: This was an advisory committee established by Trump to support and promote a more ""patriotic education"".
38. The repeal of the Clean Power Plan: This was a significant environmental policy change where the Trump administration replaced the Obama-era Clean Power Plan with the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which gave states more power to determine their own emissions standards.",84,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/164yzbg/list_of_trumps_top_35_policies_and_achievements/,1693353770.0,164yzbg

elites,conservative,"Before blaming Trump for not exposing the Epstein files, consider this…","There’s a lot of talk on this sub about how Trump is either implicated in the Epstein files or is going to be assassinated if he tries to expose it. And I get where that comes from. There’s plenty of distrust in our institutions and the Epstein case is shady from every angle.

But I think it’s worth at least entertaining another possibility: maybe Epstein really *wasn’t* part of some vast elite child trafficking conspiracy. Maybe it was mostly just him and Maxwell doing horrifying stuff, and the rest of it, particularly the idea that there’s a massive network of politicians and celebrities involved, has been blown out of proportion.

I’m not saying that to let anyone off the hook. I think a lot in Trump's orbit were pushing this stuff because it was politically expedient and now deserve the blowback they are getting. But before writing off Trump or this administration as “compromised” because they haven’t “released all the list,” it’s worth asking: what if there just isn’t as much there as people think?

Michael Tracey has been pretty consistent on this and raise some good points if you're interested in more than just the surface-level outrage:

elites,conservative,Why I Will Vote Trump Tomorrow,"I first voted for Trump in 2016, but voted third party in 2020. Tomorrow, I will once again cast a ballot for the Donald.

I didn't vote for Trump in 2020 because I was wholly upset with his cabinet picks. His team was as swampy as ever, and they constantly gave him bad advice, opposed him at every turn, and in general made his administration a lot less effective than it otherwise could have been.

In 2024 however, the lineup has shifted tremendously. 

Vance is an incredible VP pick, with a true rags to riches story that represents the ethos of America. Notice how the Dems dropped the whole ""weird"" tag line very early on, once he had a chance at the national spotlight and embarrassed every hostile interviewer.

RFK and Tulsi are the last few remnants of the Democratic Party that had any valid points to make, as far as I can tell. RFK's insight on consumer protection when it comes to our food, as well as his critique of the corruptive force that is big pharma is sorely needed in our country at the moment. Tulsi is a glaring reminder at how anti-war the Democrats used to be, and how hypocritical they are now for becoming the party backed by the military industrial complex.

Then you have Elon Musk, who successfully fired most of the useless staff at X, and Vivek, who eloquently stated the case for dismantling the managerial class during his presidential campaign. These are the people Trump needs if he wants to drain the swamp. A businessman who has already done it, and another businessman who can meticulously execute that plan at the federal level. On top of that, although we're just going off of tweets at this point, the thought of RON PAUL helping Elon to gut the bureaucracy gives me goosebumps. I don't know how many of you were around for his presidential runs in 2008 and 2012, but I am here for any remote possibility that can land him some influence in an upcoming administration.

As much as they love to call Trump a fascist, without a remote understanding of what that word actually means, it isn't Trump threatening to end the filibuster, or to pack the supreme court. Trump isn't the one willing to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on militarization, on top of over a million Eastern European lives for the sake of expanding the geopolitical influence of Western elites. Trump isn't the one dictating to big tech who or what they should censor, and he isn't the one waging a frivolous lawfare campaign to imprison his political opponents.

That's about it. Get out and vote, y'all.

elites,conservative,Is it possible for the democrats to win the presidency?,"I don't think it's possible for the democrats to win this year. Obviously, we keep our foot on the pedal and keep working towards winning,  lbut what realistic option do democrats have to replace Biden? 

Option 1: Biden stays the nominee. 

His mental decline will continue to speed up by the time of the general election, and voting him into office is basically national suicide. All of our enemies will go hostile, knowing the us is very weak.

Option 2: Presidential candidate Kamala?

No one actually thinks Kamala is competent enough of a person to actually run the country. That's why she is bidens VP. Although she had gone up in the betting markets, rn she only sits at 20ish%. 

Option 3: The Biden Coup...

I don't realistically see an option where Biden and Kamala both step down, as Jill Biden and Kamala Harris are both pretty power hungry. So, if the delegates at the DNC choose someone else as candidate, then doesn't a huge amount of trust get lost in the DNC? What happens when the current president who is running for reelection who won the primaries gets ousted?  Biden has been in a bad mental state the entire year, and the democrats had all year to have someone run against him. Instead, what do they do? They basically kicked RFK out of their primary...

sheep,conservative,A Synopsis of Tim Walz,"I've lived in Minnesota all my life, and never in my lifetime have I seen a more incompetent Governor of this State. Below you will find a synopsis of Tim Walz's failures, and why he is a menace to Minnesota and will be for the United States if elected.

**Frauds, and Mismanagement of Taxpayer Funds**

Walz and the Democrat Farmer-Labor (DFL in Minnesota) have blown out spending during Walz's tenure.

* [Minnesota issued $428mil in unemployment overpayments during the pandemic.](https://alphanews.org/report-says-minnesota-overpaid-430-million-in-unemployment-benefits-across-three-years/)

* [Minnesota distributed $10mil in fradulent Medicare claims](https://alphanews.org/five-twin-cities-residents-charged-in-over-10m-medicaid-fraud/)

* [Of the individuals who applied for the frontline worker payments, only 60% were confirmed as eilgible](https://alphanews.org/audit-500-million-covid-program-eligible-minnesotans/)

* [Feeding our Future, given funds with the oversight of the Minnesota Department of Education, defrauded the government of over $250mil](https://alphanews.org/commentary-the-dfls-250-million-coverup/)

**Why is this important?**

* Under the oversight of Walz, not a single head of department who so grossly mismanaged distribution of these taxpayer dollars has been held accountable. Specifically during the Feeding our Future food fraud scandal, fraudulent distribution sites were claiming to be feeding thousands of children per day in towns where the population was not possible to have met their claims. These numbers were not verified, and truly nothing was verified resulting in this massive fraud. 

**Budget and Overspending**

In 2022-2023, the State of Minnesota carried a $17.5bil budget surplus. An incredibly exorbitant surplus, signaling significant over-taxation of the population. What was done with this surplus? 

* Governor Walz promised during his campaign a $2,000 rebate check with the surplus for joint tax filers, and $1,000 for single filers. The MN DFL then reduced that number to $550 for joint filers, and $275 for single filers. Ultimately, it was settled on $260 for single filers, and $520 for joint filers. Governor Walz promised this check wouldn't be taxed. [It was subsequently taxed by the federal government, and had to be claimed on this year's tax filings.](https://alphanews.org/democrats-trim-rebate-checks-down-to-260-per-filer/)

* Normally, you would expect a significant surplus to allow for lasting tax cuts given such a surplus would give the State a cushion for spending. However, under Walz, nearly the entire surplus was spent on new and existing programs, which are not one time expenditures, raising the biennium spending baseline by $14bil. [This money won't just pop up out of thin air, so what does that mean? More taxation.](https://www.americanexperiment.org/where-minnesotas-17-5-billion-surplus-went-a-series/)

**Failures during George Floyd riots**

* [Governor Walz failed as a leader by hesitating to deploy the National Guard to the streets of Minneapolis to control rioting after the death of George Floyd. A very detailed account can be found here](https://www.americanexperiment.org/the-truth-about-gov-walz-and-the-national-guard/)

**Cushy lifestyle**

* Governor Walz was residing in the governor's mansion, but decided it needed some renovations. The original budget for the renovations was around $7mil, but suddenly jumped to double that number, between $13-$14mil. Who's footing that bill you ask? The Minnesota taxpayer. Where is Governor Walz in the meantime? He's living in the mansion that houses the president of the University of Minnesota, which carries a $4,400 a month rent bill. Also covered by the taxpayer. 

In summary, Tim Walz is an utter disaster for the State of Minnesota. He has drained the bank accounts of many, while allowing his own cities to burn, and has the audacity to pretend to be some folksy do gooder who enjoys hunting, fishing, and is an every man. He is nothing more than a wolf in sheep's clothing. He is a fraud and a phony who is down with the revolution, and is prepared to continue the destruction of this once great nation.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1eliblh/a_synopsis_of_tim_walz/,1722952257.0,1eliblh
sheep,conservative,Your government conspired against you. Use your time in quarantine to fight back.,"I can just sense the folks waiting to pounce.  To say that this is my tin foil hat moment.  Those are precisely the people I want to reach.

No one denies that the Wikileaks from the DNC were genuine.  The DNC doesn't even deny that.  They just scream that ""the Russians did it because Trump made them""!

Sometimes a thing is long past... but a situation develops.  And you think back to the thing and begin to understand how much light that forgotten thing can shine on the current situation.  This isn't about the Chinese Coronavirus (triggered!)...this isn't about anything being fake or made up.  This isn't to scaremonger over **common sense** measures that the government has taken and has asked us to take in order to flatten the curve and ameliorate the situation.  The virus is real and people are dying of it.  We all want to ensure that we do not have a tragedy on our hands.

At this point, though, I would like to draw your attention to one of the leaked emails. Grab a cup of coffee or tea and a biscuit and let's explore something. [This is the leaked email that I want to discuss now.  Have a read.  It's insidious.](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3599)

Now, in order to put this into perspective, we need to understand the people involved in this email exchange.

[This is Bill Ivey.](http://globalculturalstrategies.com/bio/)

>From 1998 through 2001 Ivey served in the Clinton-Gore administration as Senate-confirmed chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, and in that capacity is credited with both increasing the agency’s budget and restoring good relations between the NEA and Capitol Hill.

>Bill Ivey is a trustee of the Center for American Progress, and was a Team Leader in the Barack Obama presidential transition. He is the author of two books on culture and politics, Arts, Inc: How Greed and Neglect Have Destroyed Our Cultural Rights (California, 2008), and Handmaking America: A Back-to-Basics Pathway to a Revitalized American Democracy (Counterpoint, 2012).

[This is John Podesta.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta)

He was chair of Hillary's campaign.  Both of these men are **academics**, employed by universities, but involved with think tanks looking to influence policy.

This is the sentence of the Wikileaked email that I think we need to take a very careful look at:

#  And as I've mentioned, we've all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general *conspire* to produce an *unaware and compliant citizenry.*  The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.

This might almost seem boring if you are looking in the emails for salacious details or tidbits about corruption or Hillary.  But this is honestly the most damning email of that bunch.  Look at the language.  

They have been **content** to demean government and drop civics.

These are academics and policy makers.  Cultural shapers, HAPPY to demean government and **drop** civics.  What's civics?

>Civic education is the study of the theoretical, political and practical aspects of citizenship, as well as its rights and duties.

In short...they are happy that you don't know your rights and duties as a citizen.

And it gets WORSE:

>**conspire** to produce an **unaware and compliant** citizenry

They were happy to conspire to create dumb sheep.  That's what this means.  They want you stupid and willing to do whatever the government (sheepdog) wants, even if your rights (that you don't know about because they *conspired* to keep you ignorant) are trampled.  You should be angry.  You should be angry if you are an American with a civic education or an American wondering why people are telling you that gun control is wrong.  You should be ANGRY.  Angry enough to do something about what these folks conspired to do.

Because look at what comes next:

> The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly.

The stupid peasants are *revolting*!

Who here thinks that unawareness is something that should ever be described as ""strong.""  Remember, these are academics.  They know what these words mean.

What comes next in the email is also fascinating.  And ties into this problem of not knowing what the government can and cannot do.

>Rubio's press conference yesterday AM was good and should be repeated in its
entirety, not just in nibbles.

Here's a Democrat praising Rubio.  If you were unaware, Marco Rubio was busted giving conflicting statements about ending DACA depending on whether he was speaking Spanish or English.

>Perhaps Rubio’s most severe shift to the anti-immigrant extreme was his recent promise to end DACA, a program protecting some 700,000 young immigrants from deportation. He not only promised to end DACA, but to end it on day one of his Presidency. It was a dramatic turnaround from what he had once told Univision in Spanish, that the program would have to end, but just not right away because it would be “so deeply disruptive.” So much for that.

On immigration Rubio really isn't to be trusted.  And how did we get ""DACA"" anyway?  It's because they conspired to drop civics.  The original proposals about Dreamers were supposed to apply to a specific number of kids that had come to America between certain years and had grown up here.  Them and only them.  Somehow it changed into a perpetual policy.  And Obama enacted it **unconstitutionally**.  

The case is working its way through the courts, but anyone with an education in civics (including Obama) knows that he had no right as President to enact DACA.  That was a matter for Congress.  He usurped their authority and worked outside the purview of his *own* authority in order to turn on the neon DACA light telling anyone that as long as they could sneak their kids into America and live here for long enough undetected, their children would be made citizens on the order of King Barack.

But Trump saying he has the authority to tell states to re-open once the China virus danger has passed?  Suddenly you are just certain that you understand civics and Trump has no right to do it!  Where were you when Obama instituted DACA?  Probably watching the Real Housewives.

Ever wonder why entertainment is full of distracting crap and you don't see many movies about *good* people doing *great* things anymore?  Wonder why communists are being glorified in culture?  Wonder why shows are so full of messages about how bad the nation is?  Wonder why celebrities yell at you from the stage as they collect their awards and pretend to thank Jesus and their agent?  Did you look real hard at Bill Ivey's autobiography? [Here's more reading for you to conspire over...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ivey)

""Hey, you said you wanted an endowment to help you produce your film about the remarkable and inspirational life of Ronald Reagan, but this script talks about his lifelong black friend William Franklin Burghardt, makes him seem like he did something useful during the war, infers that communism is bad and doesn't talk about how he personally invented crack and dropped it in black communities, so we don't have any endowment money for you.""

Are any of you natives feeling restless yet?  When you look at reddit and you see people commenting and they are suggesting a government that would infringe on your rights...when they talk about the Constitution as a dumb piece of paper written by racist white men...when they think there's some infinite pool of wealth from which they could dip to have a life as a professional twitch streamer while government checks roll in with their UBI?  When they cheer that an outdoor drive-in church service was broken up by police because these are scary corona times and don't stop to think, ""But drive-in movies are open...so what's wrong with a drive in Easter service?""

When you read that Pelosi's trying to stick gun control in the Coronavirus bill and you don't get angry, but instead think...""Well, this is how it's always done in DC and Republicans should compromise...because I like gun control and think we need it so let's get it done **this** way.""

Yeah, all that is happening because they ***conspired*** to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry.

And now they are dealing with people who DO know their civics recognizing that some things are a bridge too far.  It seems like maybe some folks are using this pandemic to test our willingness to comply...and those who know their rights will NOT accept the unreasonable suspension of them.

And to go back to the email, they are afraid of this:

>This problem demands some serious, serious thinking - and not just poll driven,
demographically-inspired messaging.

You are beginning to not be compliant...that's a problem.  You will be assimilated!

So fight back by using your time in quarantine, if you have not ... to go ahead and give yourself the lesson in civics that they kept from you.  The online resources are:

sheep,conservative,On modern propaganda,"I was responding to a simple posting in a thread, and the thoughts kept coming. As the rabbit hole got deeper and deeper, I decided to make it a standalone post instead.

Propaganda 

**Subtle**, propaganda is for changing minds / public opinion. This has become so pervasive now that it’s the norm, and thus almost undetectable by the masses without a non-propagandized baseline to compare it to.  

This means a normal person’s “unbiased”, “baseline” content is in fact propagandized and skewed tremendously.  Fox news (not the opinion shows, just the news) for example is considered extreme far right, when in fact it’s often rather left of center.

The **In your face** propaganda, that we’re seeing now, is designed to motivate action. It’s the dehumanization of the enemy (Trump and conservatism), so that the violence it encourages produces less guilt, and can be “justified” as a righteous and necessary means to an end. 

(Think bike locks, pepper spray, and burning buildings and business)

What we’re seeing today is the modern equivalent of old war time propaganda. 

Think about it, we’ve all seen examples of those old american wartime propaganda films that played before movies.  Recall them in your mind, who was the announcing voice?  How were they filmed?  They were produced exactly like the **news** stories of the time, just the wartime productions were higher energy and more **in your face**, designed for a different, specific purpose. 

Those movie films were how people received their visual news content.  

That distinctive announcer voice, the short compelling visual and audio clips (that may or may not be remotely in context) with the trusted news announcer voice telling the viewer exactly what to think and what to feel.  It is effective. Even today, when viewing them, and knowing how they work and what they were for, it still stirs something inside of us. 

These were not designed to change minds, the subtle stuff had already done that. They were designed to energize, to call to action. “Enlist, Buy War Bonds, Support the War Effort, FIGHT!”

Today, we have the exact same thing. And it’s still delivered and presented as factual news, and much of what we see is still largely out of context or just plain fake. We even have the modernized trusted news “voice” (narrator, written opinion, etc) still telling us what to think and how to feel.  The only differences are the new ways we ingest this “news”. 

TV plot lines pushing the narrative, movies with the evil corporation trope, “news” articles telling us 10 reasons why the way we think and feel is wrong... or just the good old fashion talking head news of CNN and MSNBC giving us those same short compelling clips of visual and audio, and then telling us how to think and feel about it. The only thing missing is a rousing march or a mournful orchestra background audio track to drive the emotion home. 

The people we’re seeing protesting today are sheep, Baaaaaaah!’ing in unison. They’ve been told to be outraged, so they are. They’ve been told to be offended, so they are.  They’ve been told to take action. So they are.  

I’m disgusted and repulsed by it. But at the same time, it’s sadly understandable.  How much do you really blame the average North Korean for thinking the “dear leader” doesn’t poop, birds sang across the land upon his birth, and he no longer plays golf having mastered the sport?

The kids of today have literally been raised on near North Korean style propaganda. Independent thought crushed out of them. 12 years of schooling where every day they’re force fed liberalism, and outside of school the online media, movies, news, even video games all supporting the message. 

Can you blame them for thinking Trump is literally a Nazi? What choice did they have?  

I argue that It’s amazing that so many have managed to #walkaway and escape that thought prison. 

Of course we still have to fight them, just as we had to fight the brain washed masses of Germany, Japan, Korea and today’s modern radical Islam.

sheep,conservative,"Political scientist Hamed Abdul-Samad speaks courageously about Islam, saying things that westerners don't dare...warning us that it is a form of fascism. Powerful interview!","Hamed Abdel-Samad is an Egyptian born political scientist, historian and author, now living in Germany. He is the son of a Sunni imam, but has dedicated the recent years of his life to warning against the political side of Islam. 

The German-Egyptian journalist Hamed Abdel-Samad challenges a religion of which he himself is a member. An interview by Dietrich Alexander. 

Die Welt: You are very pessimistic about the future of the Arab-Islamic world in general. The term fascism in connection with political Islam is certainly new, isn't it?

Abdel-Samad: For Germans this may sound bold and provocative. But what is fascism? It is a political religion, with truths, with prophets, with a charismatic leader who is equipped with a supposedly holy mission to unite the nation and defeat the enemies. That’s also exactly what Islam is. Fascism divides the world into friends and enemies. In Islam, there are believers and unbelievers. The conspiracy theories in fascism, the feeling of humiliation and having come off badly, this desire for revenge and the dehumanization of the enemy, are all found in Islam, especially in the language of political Islam. The mix of inferiority complex and striving for world domination, of impotence and omnipotence fantasies, links Islamism and fascism. In my book, I write on the 14 theses by Umberto Eco on Ur-Fascism. There, we find it all: the cult of tradition, the attitude to the modern age and the counter-revolution against Enlightenment, the conspiracy theories, the Machism. All that the Islamists are missing is the machinery for mass-destruction that was available to the Stalinists and the National Socialists. Islamism suffered several defeats, but has never been trounced — unlike fascism in Germany and Italy. That is the reason why Islamic fascism drags on.

Die Welt: Would you go as far as to say that the political, fascist Islam would drag the world into a Third World War, if it had the opportunity to get its hands on such destructive machinery?

Abdel-Samad: Yes, maybe not with a world war straightaway, but we will see a battle of apocalyptic dimensions. The Islamists would lead a campaign of revenge against the infidels. On a small scale, you can observe this where Islamists take power in Syrian towns. People are then killed just because they are Christians, even children. This is pure fascism, that people are executed only on the basis of their religious or national affiliation. We can watch that everywhere where Islamists take power, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria — no matter where.

Die Welt: And the so-called “moderate Islam”? Does it exist, anyway?

Abdel-Samad: For a long time, we had this prime example of a supposedly moderate Islam in Turkey with Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the top. The political opportunism of the West has prevented this system from having to show its true face. Only now, in crisis, and under the real political and democratic test, we recognize fascist tendencies there as well.

Die Welt: A wolf in sheep’s clothing, then? Or as you call it in your book: democracy as a Trojan horse?

Abdel-Samad: Exactly. The Islamist who wants to come to power is not interested in democracy. He does not believe in it, he believes in the rule of God. He is not interested in fighting unemployment, but wants to enforce a particular moral order of society and then the rest of the world.

Die Welt: So a divine mandate?

Abdel-Samad: Yes. That’s the only thing that motivates him to engage in politics. He does not respect human-made structures such as parliaments and the judiciary, because God has set the law for him already 1400 years ago. It only needs to be applied.

Die Welt: That would mean that dialogue is not possible with these people…

Abdel-Samad: … dialogue, in this case, is actually a waste of time. With Erdogan, a dialogue has been conducted, but he has fooled the West. His so-called reforms were more like empowerment laws. “Moderate Islam” is an invention of Western Islamic scholars. Moderate and Islam is a paradox, they do not match. The truths of the Islamists are already determined. This is also a core characteristic of fascism.

Die Welt: What you say is surely not without danger. You have received death threats, live under police protection, bring family and friends into danger. In a way, you risk your life for your beliefs. Would you therefore describe yourself as a martyr?

Abdel-Samad: No. I like neither the term nor the mindset behind it. I like living very much, despite all the difficulties and problems that I have. But I have long searched for an access to this life and I sacrificed and lost a lot to get it. This life concept is called freedom. It means that no one can determine my morals, my way of thinking and speaking. The fact that there are people in this world who cannot live with that is really not my problem. I have not cut anyone’s throat and I do not intend to do so. I have never questioned the right to exist of any human. I do not think it is worth to die for anything. But I will not moderate or restrict my thoughts and comments just because others do not like what I say. I do not want nor need this “little life”.

Die Welt: Is any Arab-Islamic country able to assume the role of a pioneer in this regard?

Abdel-Samad: No. Maybe Tunisia within the foreseeable future, as it is small, its civil society is quite well organized, and the West supports the development of civil and democratic structures.

Die Welt: You say that you stirred up a hornet’s nest with your book. Usually, hornet’s nests are smoked out, they are burnt. What is your strategy to combat political Islam? Is there a means, perhaps the economic success of a rival — maybe democratic — system?

Abdel-Samad: The disease must be diagnosed correctly. A clear diagnosis has not been permitted in the past. I see myself as a diagnosing physician. As Karl Kraus said, “I cannot lay eggs, but I can recognize a foul one.” It’s about the chronic diseases of Arab societies: lack of education, lack of economic structures, corruption, paternalism…the list is long. This is the swamp in which fascist Islamism tries to catch people who are stuck in this swamp of frustration. They are light-years away from the modern world. It is much easier for them to withdraw to a ideological level, rather than to address the problems and solve them. A preacher who is considered moderate in the West seriously said that the economic decline has only started since we no longer take jihad seriously. He seriously suggests new wars of conquest against Christian countries, head tax for Christians and Jews, the enslavement of opponents. These are frighteningly clear parallels to fascism, this is inhuman. The helpless leaders are overwhelmed and tell fairytales. Just like an Egyptian general who has loudly proclaimed that they had discovered a secret weapon against AIDS recently. All of this feeds on the same myths, is quixotic, and stews in its own juice. This creates a transfigured world view from which you cannot break out.

Die Welt: So Islam and democracy are not compatible?

Abdel-Samad: Of course not. By claiming that they are, you prolong the disease and delay the healing process. True Islam is as true socialism: So great, but unfortunately, it is nowhere practiced around the world. The Islamic world deceives itself by thinking that an Islamic system could be democratic. Democracy means that the people decide. Islam means that God is the legislator.

Die Welt: That sounds hopeless and is hardly encouraging for the 1.5 billion Muslims in the world…

Abdel-Samad: The Arab-Islamic societies want to be modern and successful. But when I want to build a car, I first need to familiarize myself with the laws of physics, with the mechanics and even with the environmental regulations that apply in a modern world. Then I have to see what materials are available to me. But I do not have to re-invent the wheel. I just need to figure out which of my materials fit car manufacturing and which don’t. Cow dung and car do not fit. To insist that cow dung should be part of the car is a fatal fallacy. Applied to the Islam-democracy discussion: There are Western intellectuals who say that it will somehow work out with the cow dung. This is not to help one to help himself, but anesthesia. The Muslims did not invent the car, but buy it anyway. Why should that not be possible in the case of democracy? We insist on sharing our culture, even if this is a hindrance.

Die Welt: You call Islam a “belated religion” which got stuck in the year 1435 and thus lives in its own Middle Ages. Does this mean that the Islamic world will have to go through all that Europe has experienced in its Middle Ages?

Abdel-Samad: Absolutely. We are heading towards a religious war between Sunnites and Shiites of global dimensions. And we can only hope that afterwards, we will have a reformation, as was the case in Europe. We cannot get past it, but the price will be high. The juvenile masses without perspective and hope can only be fed, employed – and burnt — by religious wars.

Die Welt: Samuel Huntington once spoke of the “clash of civilizations” and meant Islam against Western culture. You speak of an “inner clash of civilizations”, an intra-Arab struggle. About what?

Abdel-Samad: The ideological war rages between a modern, Western-oriented class that got partly independent from the official knowledge and the religious supremacy of Islam, and the traditional forces which fear freedom. Fascism has always been feeding on this fear. The war is considered a chance of rebirth, by fascists as by Islamists. That world peace can only be restored if all people belonged to Islam. This is not Islamism, it is already written in the Koran. We can only counteract this by addressing the roots of this ideology, without taboos, and tear them out. Whoever calls that radical, belittles the problem.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/226r3n/political_scientist_hamed_abdulsamad_speaks/,1396616531.0,226r3n
brainwashed,conservative,Reddit as a community is justifying and even celebrating CKs murder in the domestic terrorist attack Friday.,"This was my response to a state political page that left up a post calling CK a Nazi.  Seeing as how it was removed within 5 minutes, I wanted to share my thoughts here.  Obviously its not directed at this page.

""This is beyond depressing.  America could have come out and united.  We could have taken a real easy take saying ""No matter your political beliefs, no matter religion, creed, or color, its not okay to murder someone in front of their children""

This is not what happened though.  Instead, this subreddit, and pretty much every other subreddit across this entire community seemed to decide to justify and even celebrate his murder. People here have collectively decided, that because someone has the label of fascist, racist, and whatever else the MSM and political leaders of the Democrats want to label him, that, its actually okay to Murder someone in front of thousands.

Ill add that none of these labels fit him, no matter the quotes taken out of context people here have been fed. He was a Christian who tried his best to live his life as a Christian.  You are free to disagree with how he chose to live his life, and he offered you a platform to disagree with him, hed give you a mic and the time to explain your position and ask him questions.

This murderer, who was a left wing radicalized lunatic (as evidenced by his engravings in the bullets) was a coward, a terrorist, and has elevated CK to a level he never would have reached while he was alive.

People will respond to this says ""the killer was right wing, CK was a Nazi, Im a Nazi, CK supported the second ammendment so he deserved it"" the list will go on and on, but you are doing nothing but justifying the murder of a man who was speaking something you didnt like.

Im not asking the community to love him or anything like that.  But for a second, can we come together against domestic terrorism like this?

If not, I think you've been irrevocably brainwashed by this insane rhetoric coming from the Democrats.  They repeat, over and over and over again, that anyone they dont like is a Fascist and a Nazi.  Its a numbers game that if they get enough people to believe this then a lunatic will come out and shoot them dead in front of their 3 year old child.

I was never a CK fan, I watched a few of his videos and thought he was probably wasting his time.  But after Friday, and watching this communities reaction, I've come to conclusion that anyone celebrating the murder of their political enemies is absolutely evil. If we want to survive as a country you as a community need to root out this behavior. Stop labeling your political enemies as Nazis.

Im sure the mods on this page will ban me for this post and it may never even see the light of day.  But know that youre contributing to the downfall of America and helping us to the path where we settle political differences with bullets instead of words.""

Subreddits everywhere will kill this discussion through the use of mods.  We need to put this behavior on full display so the American people can see how evil and vile the left has become.",544,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ng7x4y/reddit_as_a_community_is_justifying_and_even/,1757795382.0,1ng7x4y

brainwashed,conservative,A large proportion of the German people is completely brainwashed,"To be honest, I'm not even sure if I should post my tirade here or if it's even appropriate. I'm in my mid-20s, I'm from Germany and I have the feeling that my homeland is going completely crazy a few weeks before the elections.

Why do i see it that way? Well, maybe some of you here are informed about the current political situation in Europe. Maybe some of you are thinking - why should I care about elections in Germany? I want to explain it. A large percentage of my fellow countrymen are extremely brainwashed, politically left-wing and refuse to acknowledge social realities by any means possible. And I think that the whole thing is even more extreme than in the USA, for example, because it feels like there is no political change in sight. But what is it about?

As you know, because of our past Germans do not have a healthy relationship with their country. Everything that has to do with national pride and the interests of their own culture has a difficult undertone in public. This has led, among other things, to the fact that since 2015 we have had massive, uncontrolled immigration, which no political party has seriously fought or even stopped - in contrast to other European countries, which have had much more sensible policy changes in this regard. The inner-European borders were already abolished in the 1990s. There are only external EU border controls, but they are very porous. The exact numbers of new immigrants, mostly from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, North Africa and the Middle East, are not really known. It must be somewhere between 3-5 million, because our population has increased by five million since 2014, although the number of Germans without foreign roots has been declining sharply since the 1970s. Why do all the people come here? The answer is simple. Unconditional social benefits, lax laws, hardly any cases where people have to leave and a culture without self-respect. The country has been changing consistently for the worse for the past 10 years. We constantly hear about rapes, stabbings, random attacks, break-ins and increasingly run-down neighborhoods. The two major parties have done nothing about it so far. Both the supposedly ""conservative"" CDU, which governed with Merkel until 2021, and the left-wing alliance of Social Democrats, Greens and Liberals under Scholz. In recent weeks there have been some sad and terrible terrorist acts. An Islamist and rejected asylum seeker randomly murdered people with a knife at a city festival. In Mannheim, an Islamist stabbed a policeman in a market place. In the city of Magdeburg, a man from Saudi Arabia known to the police drove into a crowd and killed several people - hundreds were injured. And most recently, a small kindergarten child was stabbed to death in a park in a bavarian town. These are just a few of the many terrible murders committed by rejected asylum seekers that have been happening repeatedly since 2015. Many of them don't even make it into the media. But how are people reacting on a large scale? How do you think the media is covering the whole thing? It's just crazy. After almost every Islamist-motivated attack, there is a ""demonstration against right-wing extremism"". This is also what happened a few days ago. After a two-year-old child was randomly stabbed in the street, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated against the only political force, the AfD, which has been pointing out these problems for 10 years and is therefore consistently excluded from all political cooperation in the cities, federal states and in the Bundestag (parliament). There are even considerations to ban the party - although it is unlikely that this will succeed, the attempt to ban voices critical of the government is clearly evident here. The media are playing along and are happy to report on protests against the AfD and view the party exclusively negatively, fuelling the narrative that the party has no place in the German party landscape. The perpetrators of these attacks are often just labelled as mentally ill - society is often blamed for the fact that they have become so radicalised and should have received help. At the same time, the ""conservative"" party that caused the whole debacle with Angela Merkel is portraying itself as a saviour in times of need. A party that 30 days before the election comes up with the idea that the borders should be controlled and illegal immigrants should be send back, even though it has not done anything on its own responsibility. There will never be any improvement with this party, because after the election it only wants to work with left-wing parties. I have the feeling that there is a political agenda to make all attempts to limit illegal immigration impossible.

The media try to equate all critics of migration policy with right-wing extremism and the Nazi narrative. They point out that it is not legally possible because EU guidelines do not allow it. At the same time, money is thrown at these immigrants and repeated offenders are allowed to go free again and again. Even rapists, murderers and obvious Islamists have little to fear from consequences. And slowly many immigrants who have been living here for years, paying taxes and making a good contribution to society, are also fed up with these conditions. The only party that credibly wants to do something, the AfD, is being attacked very aggressively in politics and the media and is framed as right-wing extremist and anti-democratic, and hundreds of thousands of left-wing activists take to the streets every day to demonstrate against ""Nazis"" and for a ban of this party. I have the feeling that the Germans' instilled self-hatred is eating away at this country, its culture and its security. You feel helpless, you feel completely let down by politicians and the media, because they are trying everything to act as if illegal immigration is not a real problem. Anyone who looks at these left-wing protests who are against stricter asylum laws has the feeling that it is a cult. How could hundreds of thousands of people come up with the idea of ​​demonstrating against the political force that is the only thing that wants to prevent Islamist-motivated attacks? You see politicians from the left and the Greens shouting still things like ""Refugees Welcome"" and taking happy selfies, completely ignoring the fact that their own politics have caused these conditions in our society. And when the AfD has party conferences or election campaign events where completely normal things are demanded, this is artificially scandalized in the media. But you only realize that when you listen to the speeches at these events and then see what the state media makes out of them. The media often speak of a collective “we”, which is moral and good, and of the “others”, the evil right-wingers, who are labeled as ""undemocratic pro-russian trolls"". Meanwhile, in other German reddit communities here you can find numerous people celebrating each other for their alleged moral superiority and calling for a ban on the AfD. Of course not everyone in the country is so stupid - but judging by the opinion polls, the majority are. The AfD is not a right-wing extremist party. Don't let the media tell you such nonsense. Protecting your own culture, values ​​and security is not right-wing extremism. And if the other parties had successfully combatted this problem of uncontrolled mass immigration just like other countries, the AfD would not exist. But the governing parties prefer to cling to these left-wing ideals and practically demand that nothing be done and everything be left as it is - ""for democracy"". This country makes me sick.",23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ibcn9k/a_large_proportion_of_the_german_people_is/,1737994031.0,1ibcn9k
brainwashed,conservative,Former Democrat and liberal here—I think I’m switching sides ,"I hate the terms “switching sides” because I don’t view politics as binary anymore. There are some issues where I still hold a fairly “liberal” stance (abortion, gun safety, I still support some specific government programs, etc.)

But I’m a California resident raised in a SUPER liberal environment where conservatism and the Republic party was always deemed evil and ignorant. One thing I want conservatives to know is that it’s really not the fault of the people who fall under that spell—the brainwashing starts early and runs DEEP. It’s very, VERY difficult to disentangle yourself from it and see things clearly.

What’s ironic is that the reason I’ve started to move further to the right is because I started researching the issues I felt passionately about because I was trying to back up my leftist beliefs! The more I educated myself the more I questioned why I even believed the things I did.

I know that as a California resident my vote doesn’t matter, but I think I’m going to vote Trump this fall. This is coming from someone who ALWAYS voted Dem straight down the line. Who cried tears when Trump won in 2016. I still have some complaints about the guy, he’s far from perfect, but I’m realizing that he far, far, FAR better represents my best interests as an American compared to ANYONE in the major Democratic establishment. And that I was painted a very incomplete picture of him by mainstream media.

Btw I’m a young Indian American woman and Kamala ain’t fooling me. 

Anyone else here converted from left to right? What was your journey like? I’m still very much in the “closet” so I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this. 

EDIT! Since so many people are asking which issues I changed my mind on. Posting some here:

- Gender ideology. I have some trans friends and started very left on this issue. The more I studied it and learned about it, the less I believed in it and the more I felt it encroached on women’s rights. The entire ideology actually makes NO sense when you think about it and the assault on children is unforgivable to me. 

- Immigration. I grew up in the 90s and I remember an era where “illegal” immigrants were mostly hard working, contributing members of society. That has changed. The migrant crisis is out of control and these immigrants are no longer your hard working laborers who love America, they are leeching off the system and worsening the quality of life of hardworking Americans. AND turning around and lambasting the country that has given them such a great life 

- Government size. I used to have this very idealistic view that government was an instrument of good and that the real world White House looked like the TV show The West Wing. I used to support big government because I thought it would help the misfortunate. Now I realize that in our world, bigger government = more corruption 

- being “soft on crime”. Again, I don’t think the justice system is black and white and I do think it has some flaws but I used to believe that being soft on crime was the compassionate thing to do. That most criminals weren’t actually criminals, just unfairly targeted and victimized by the justice system. But I’ve spent most of my adult life between San Francisco and LA and I’ve realize that we cannot live in a society that doesn’t punish crime. And honestly at this point Democrat policies almost incentives crime, which is so difficult to look past 

- Guns. I still support some measures of gun control but I used to support fully repealing the 2nd amendment. I don’t anymore. I’ve lived in the real world now and I understand the need to have a gun (especially as a single woman). I’ve gotten more involved in gun culture and the people have been welcoming and warm and I’ve come to view them in a new light 

-  Taxes. I used to think it was moral to pay taxes through the nose but I’m looking around and wondering—where the hell is all my money going?! Education, infrastructure, housing, etc. have all been continuously going downhill. So why is half my paycheck going into taxes? How is it benefitting me and other Americans?!

- DEI/racism/affirmative action. This is a huge one for me. As an Indian American, affirmative action very much discriminated against me but I was naive enough to think “well that’s a good thing! That’s how things should be! I should have to work harder for the same thing than other races.” Very warped brain state. I’m very well aware that my status as a female “person of color” and as someone who legitimately has some real life claims to “victimhood” could have very much aided me in my career and life in recent years. But I realized I do NOT want that to be a defining factor of my personhood. I don’t want it to be that for anyone’s. We should all be judged for our MERIT. The fact that Kamala was a DEI pick and stands to become the next president without truly earning the position? Embarrassing. We should treat people with compassion and be understanding of individual circumstances but I reject DEI in its entirely and always will. I reject the leftists victomhood narrative wholeheartedly.

EDIT #2: thank to those of you who have been supportive and engaging with your comments! I will try to get around to responding to everyone but the majority of you have been great and I’ve really enjoyed reading the feedback and discussion. Some of y’all have been a tad unhinged but I guess that’s expected from the internet lol. No I’m not a bot and no I’m not a fake.

brainwashed,conservative,70% of redditors are brainwashed beyond all recognition,"Almost every subreddit in this app is far left. These people despise Trump to the point that they want to re-elect the guy who’s spent 80 billion dollars in 2 years on a war we’re not even fighting. It doesn’t click in my head how someone could be so blind to the truth. 

By all means, trump is not perfect. But I do believe he has most Americans best interest at heart. People put Biden into office because they thought Trump was a Russian spy. But if anyone is that, it’s going to be biden. The whole hunter biden dealings with Joes name attached, and the large sums of money being sent to Ukraine is fishy.

 I’m not a conspiracy theorist but for the life of me I can’t understand how we justify spending all that money in Ukraine while so many of us are working 60 hours a week and still struggling to pay the bills back in America. We send 80b dollars and yet Ukraine is still losing the war. We’re gonna keep sending money until Russia eventually outnumbers them and wins. It will result in Biden having his pockets lined with cash, zero Ukrainian men left alive to tell the tale, and millions of Americans left suffering. 80b dollars can do a whole lot of good in our country, but people want to justify giving it to a country that was previously one of the most corrupt in the world just because they think we’re helping fight the people who elected trump into office. 

Sorry for the rant, I know most of you will think I’m some hard right Trump dick rider but in reality I’m just a suffering father who seen blatant courruption everyday for the past 2 years. I love this country and everyone who resides here no matter what they identify as, but it feels like the beginning of the end of this great empire.

brainwashed,conservative,Addressing the silent majority. WE EXIST,"Hey, first off a bit about myself. I was a centrist recently turned conservative. I attend college at a very liberal university. I go to my classes, do well, stay out of trouble, listen and learn. 

At this university I am forced to listen to an agenda that I believe is destroying the United States, and I can't say anything about it. 

Of course I could speak up and speak out, but then I am at a very real risk of my professors, people who are professionals, failing me for my differing ideology. If I were to speak out I also put myself at risk of being shunned, alienated, and mocked by my peers and friends, people whom I respect.

In fact this happened once.

When I was a fresh transfer from community college I was forced to take a political science course. 

In this course I watched my peers get brainwashed by a radical liberal who argued in favor of communism, and tried to tell us that Islam is the religion of peace. Remember when Islamists peacefully flew planes into the twin towers? I sure do. 

When I wrote my chapter summary on communism for this class I happened to mention a quote I had heard from Ben Shapiro, I enjoyed listening to him at the time. Let me mention that I regularly got A's and B's in this class. 

I submitted the paper online, in order to detect plagiarism, and in a hard copy as usual and waited for the grade. 

A few days later we all got our hard copies back, and instead of a grade, my professor used a thick red sharpie and crossed out each entire page of my paper. When I turned to the page where I mentioned Ben, along with a copious amount of thick red X's my professor wrote, ""NO!!!"" scrawled a circle around the quote and drew a swastika. 

I was appaled. I was given a zero for the assignment and received no better than low D's on every other assignment I submitted in that course.

The tolerant left everyone.

In 2016 I voted for Gary Johnson. I just couldn't vote for either Hillary or Trump at the time.

This year I will be voting for Trump.

We are out here.
We see what the left has become.

We're quiet, because we have to be. 
We have reasons.

But
We're angry.
We're tired of being quiet.

And we're going to vote.

brainwashed,conservative,Fighting Censorship : A Proposal,"

##Why do we need to fight censorship?


Before Trump came, the mainstream cable and print media had control over the information flow of the country. These organizations in tandem with the brainwashing in the US education system managed to get communist Barack Obama elected president. Who further corrupted the education and information systems.

But alternative media rose which played a major part in getting the truth out (red pill). The players in alternative media also called the new right, alt right or far right (any label the left wanted) was ridiculed by the left. An information war broke out between the old dinosaurs and the new meme warriors.  We won the meme war of 2016.

The masters of the digital universe saw this as a problem. They have a profit conflict of interest to support globalism and communism. They have engaged in a long campaign of taking out the meme warriors and red pillars one by one. Deleting them from the Entire digital timeline

The aim is to reset the digital memory of the world back to zero.

Their strategy is to take us down one by one.  

If this is not stopped fast we will lose control over information and ultimately the country.

 This is as critical as the Wall and Voter ID.  Maybe even more because without an informed populace, achieving the first two will be very hard. 

Scott Adams, one of the people who predicted trump's win has raises alarms, along with other voices including POTUS himself and urgent action is warranted.

##What is being done?

There is widespread awareness of the topic. The Senate and the White House are aware of the problem and leading right-wing news channels like Breitbart and FoxNews etc are covering it.

White House has launched a data gathering project regarding censorship. People can contribute there.

A lot of alternatives have emerged like gab(twitter), minds and usa.life(facebook), dissenter (Disqus), voat and steemit (reddit), brave (chrome), Qwant(search engine) and Epik(domain registrar)

##What are the challenges?

Firstly, there are multiple small alternatives and the communities/sites are split. This leads to fragmentation as multiple people suggest multiple alternatives

Second: these sites as they are free speech communities attract actual weirdos also. This scares away people.

Third: people have a psychological fear of change, especially when digital security is concerned

Fourth: even these sites use the features of like dislikes votes upvotes (even money).  This raises fears that if these sites become big it will fall to the same manipulations like twitter and facebook. Especially considering that leftists are more prone to digitally interact than conservatives.

Lastly, there is the core problem of money itself. Big banks and payment processors are themselves 

##What can be done?

This is a multifaceted problem which shall be tackled on various fronts

Legal: We need real legal expertize to put forward the argument in the Court that the first amendment applies to the digital public sphere.

Political: We need to push for a resolution to tackle digital censorship and also keep white house attention to it.

Technological: We need technological expertize to bolster the current alternatives and to find payment alternatives

Financial: We need financial support for the above three as well as a financial alternative to big banks. Currently local banks, credit unions and crypto (I am not well versed in crypto) are solutions.


Now let us come to the actual movement to the new platforms. Content creators and consumers shall not wait for the hammer to drop and shall start at least cross-posting and cross using the alternative sites from TODAY.  All the content shall be cross-posted to prevent unannounced memory holing by big tech.  The full shift from the big tech (financial and real-life accounts) can commence when we are sure about the security features(this is my personal view, more tech-savvy people may shift right now).

But we have to at least start using them from today. This is a bit like soft and hard Brexit. What the right is doing is a soft shift. We need a hard shift.

Finally, we need direction and organization to tackle the problem.

##Proposal

Here my proposal is that we need a major organization like NRA for the first amendment. Our second amendment rights are protected in a large part because the NRA gives financial legal and political assistance.  We did not need an organization to protect the first amendment until now.

Such an organization will play the following roles

Help organize the free speech community and provide guidance on the most viable alternatives(with full transparency requirements regarding funding, tech and privacy)

Help organize the legal, financial and political effort against censorship.


Give technological and financial assistance to creators of alternatives


Give us strength in numbers so the left cannot take us down digitally one by one.

We can get this proposal to major right-wing media personalities, businesses and politicians who have spoken against censorship and political correctness.

##Some last side points. ( may be skipped)

Currently, the site which tops in free speech are the chances. They have no voting system. So if you have tough skin, one can go there.

Backup this sub...maybe own site?

There is absolutely no reason for there to be a site-centric option to remove a user (unless mandated by law) when users themselves have been given the power to block another user. 

Any true free speech alternative  shall not have a site-centric blocking option(with exception of a legal order) and its algorithms shall not favour one content over other on the basis of popularity(People shall be given a choice but making popularity default is manipulative)",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/btoc7h/fighting_censorship_a_proposal/,1558976154.0,btoc7h

agenda,conservative,The Democratic Party calling the Republican Party 'Nazi' is getting old. Especially when THEY are the party that acts like actual Nazi's.,"They like to call us the 'nazi party' and say that Trump is a 'fascist' yet, it's the democratic party that behaves like actual 'nazi's'.

Example 1: Obsession with Race: Like Hitler who was obsessed with race and used it as a means to wage genocide, Democrats are obsessed with race too. In fact, they are so obsessed that a candidate for the Democrat nominee for US Presidential elections Kamala Harris, lied about her race and claimed that she is Native American among several other races, despite the fact she is not in order to gain political benefits. Furthermore, prominent liberals in the US can be regularly found to be engaged in anti-White rhetoric where they can be seen cheering for ‘White Genocide’, all the while denying that such a thing exists.

Example 2: Ideological Unity between the Media and Political Parties: In Nazi Germany, the media served as the propaganda wing of the fascist government. The media was an extended arm of the Nazis. In the USA, we see the mainstream media act as the propaganda wing of the Democrat party. The collusion that was observed between news networks and Hillary Clinton was for all to see. The liberal American media has even justified violence by Antifa goons against their political opponents. During all of the Biden Administration, the lies, upon lies, the NEVER being able to give a straight answer a simple question, literally telling the American People that all is well and we have the highest economy and lowest unemployment in years all while US citizens can barely afford food and are living pay check to paycheck. As if we are incapable of seeing that we are struggling.

Example 3: Ideological Unity between Academia and Political Parties:: In Nazi Germany, the Academia served the Nazis greatly and even helped shape their ideology and provided them with ideas and techniques to help them achieve their nefarious objectives. We see a similar pattern in the liberal world. The political parties rely on academia for acquiring foot-soldiers and legitimizing their evil agenda while the latter relies on the former for patronage. It is the same in the US. The liberal parties work in tandem in order to indoctrinate the youth and achieve ideological objectives. Elementary School Teachers, Middle School Teachers, High School Teachers, Collage Professors! They all teach the same things, ""White People are evil,"" ""All Republicans Deserve to Die,"" ""Only Certain Lives Matter,"" ""White People Are the Problem, ""Blah blah blah. Hmmmm, sounds exactly like how the Nazi Party condemned the Jews.

Example 4: A Totalitarian Society: The most distinguishing feature of a totalitarian society or a totalitarian ideology is that the power structure isn’t merely interested in what an individual says or how he acts but also how people think. It is not enough to merely say or act in a certain way, a person must also believe the ideology completely. Otherwise, the person can be accused of a ‘thoughtcrime’ and persecuted accordingly. Merely accusations and allegations combined with certain ‘suspicious’ behavior is enough reason to completely destroy an individual’s life. For instance, a person does not have to be a ‘homophobe’ or ‘misogynist’ in order to have his life completely destroyed and ruined, mere accusations are enough. Furthermore, anyone who does not endorse the most extreme positions of the Liberal world is branded ‘homophobe’, ‘misogynist’, ‘regressive’ or whatever the latest buzzword maybe and then it is demanded that his professional career be destroyed. Mere differences in political opinions are treated as thoughtcrimes and efforts are undertaken to crush the individual. Everyone who disagrees with a liberal is evil, fascist, racist, whatever-phobic, sexist ect...ect... against whom even violence is justified.",1574,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ikilae/the_democratic_party_calling_the_republican_party/,1739002651.0,1ikilae

freedom,conservative,"I'm a Gen Z woman. l've been a ""closeted conservative"". This assassination has changed me.","I loved listening to Charlie, I have been for years. I came across the video of the assassination, not knowing what it was... couldn't believe my eyes. I can't sleep. I have never seen anything like that. I'm scarred. I'm scared. I'm heartbroken. I've been sobbing. Sobbing for him, the people who were there and witnessed it, sobbing over the fact that one of the most influential conservative voices to my generation is gone, and, most importantly, sobbing for his parents / his wife and kids. This has deeply affected me, but has also lit a fire in me.

I tend lay low when it comes to politics because everyone around me is very left leaning and aren't afraid to let it be known... but after this I have decided I'm not going to lay low anymore. If he was brave enough to stand up for his beliefs to the point of literally being murdered for it, I will be brave too, in honor of him and in honor of God. No more trying to fit in and practically being an ""undercover"" conservative and Christian.

I started putting this into practice the very next day and it has left me feeling even more concerned for my own personal reality….. I would love to hear y'all's thoughts on this.

I work on a marketing team of a pretty large company. Everyone here is very left-leaving, so I just lay low. When Trump was elected, one of the highest people in the company held an emergency meeting with our department, talking about how afraid they are and knows how we all must be feeling. We were offered to take personal time for mental health that day, as some people were crying. My direct supervisor even messaged me saying that she knows I was going through things at that time and asked if I was okay after the news Trump one and if I needed a personal break. I was thinking to myself, ""can I take personal time to celebrate?"". I let her know I’m okay and was fit to work.

After getting 0 sleep Thursday night and crying so many tears, I messaged this same supervisor spilling it all out.

I told her how I'm conservative, Christian, looked up to Charlie, saw the video, and am devastated... traumatized. I let her know I wanted to take some time off for the day and pray in honor of Charlie. My job is practically social listening and reporting, so I would be all in the weeds and knew I would see more about this horrible event, so I let her know I wasn’t ready to see it again. See anything about it. About the horrible things people are saying. She responded to me coldly, saying that I need to understand the seriousness behind a short notice call off, and how it negatively impacts other members of the team. Again, this is the  same manager pulled me aside after Trump was elected to ask me 1:1 if I need time to process it...

This... this right here opened my eyes to what's actually going on around me. Not just something I see online, no... this shit is real and it's everywhere.

I've never felt this aware. I'm scared y'all...

freedom,conservative,The High Cost of Control: Why Interventionist Planned Economies Are Always a Disaster,"In the grand arc of human history, few forces have propelled civilization forward like the free market. It is not perfect—no human institution is—but it is uniquely self-correcting, incentivizing innovation, allocating resources with uncanny precision, and offering individuals the dignity of choice. The triumph of open markets is not ideological dogma—it is a historical and empirical reality.

The Free Market: Civilization’s Greatest Engine

Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, famously argued in The Wealth of Nations (1776) that individuals pursuing their own self-interest inadvertently promote the public good through the “invisible hand.” Modern economic theory—especially Friedrich Hayek’s insights on price signals and knowledge dissemination—has since fortified that argument. In a truly open economy, prices are not just numbers; they are the distilled wisdom of millions of decentralized decisions. They allow society to coordinate vast and complex processes with stunning efficiency.

Look at the Industrial Revolution in Britain, the postwar economic boom in the United States, or the technological renaissance in Silicon Valley—each a testament to what free enterprise can unleash. These successes were not the result of centralized direction but rather of governments knowing when to step back and let competition, innovation, and entrepreneurial risk-taking do the heavy lifting.

China: A Cautionary Tale—And a Warning

China’s economic transformation in the late 20th century is a perfect illustration of this principle in action. After decades of Maoist economic central planning—which yielded little more than poverty, famine, and stagnation—Beijing initiated a series of market reforms under Deng Xiaoping beginning in 1978. These reforms didn’t fully liberalize the economy but allowed a significant degree of private ownership, competition, and market pricing.

The result was nothing short of spectacular: between 1980 and 2010, China’s GDP grew at an average rate of nearly 10% annually, lifting over 800 million people out of poverty. The introduction of private incentives into agriculture and industry—first tentatively, then more broadly—unleashed decades of pent-up human potential. China’s emergence as a manufacturing and export superpower shook the global economy to its core, presenting a formidable challenge to the industrialized West.

America and the Seduction of Economic Populism

Despite this evidence, many in the United States remain strangely detached from the global legacy of centrally planned economies. It is perhaps the luxury of never having endured breadlines or state rationing that makes parts of the American left nostalgic for economic models that have failed repeatedly and catastrophically elsewhere.

From Cuba to North Korea, from the Soviet Union to Venezuela, the history of planned economies under communist regimes is a record of scarcity, misallocation, and human suffering. Ludwig von Mises, a staunch critic of socialism, warned in Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth (1920) that the absence of market prices in a planned economy would render rational economic calculation impossible. He was right. Planned economies can marshal slogans and committees, but they cannot replicate the spontaneous order of a truly free market.

Yet in recent years, calls for expansive state control—price ceilings, wealth redistribution schemes, nationalization—have crept back into mainstream political discourse. These are not harmless policy preferences; they are the first steps on a road paved with failure. They threaten to erode what has made the U.S. economy resilient: its flexibility, its openness to innovation, and its respect for individual enterprise.

The United States Must Trust Its Economic DNA

The strength of the American economy does not lie in government diktats or five-year plans. It lies in the garage startups that become multinationals, in the relentless churn of creative destruction, in the freedom to fail and try again. Policymakers should remember that interventionist solutions—however well-intentioned—tend to calcify markets and concentrate power in the hands of bureaucrats who are, by nature, distant from the realities of everyday commerce.

As we face a century of global economic rivalry and technological disruption, the degree of economic freedom will increasingly define who leads and who follows. America cannot afford to forget what made it prosperous in the first place.

The free market is not just an economic system—it is a moral argument for liberty, responsibility, and human dignity. We abandon it at our peril.",10,https://i.redd.it/7t9jb1vccm0f1.jpeg,1747172329.0,1kly8td

freedom,conservative,So i read the US Constitution,"I don't know how you will take this since the constitution in America is some kind of a political gospel revered for itself.

That's pretty unique. Anywhere else, they revere the nature of the regime (the republic, the crown) or the political principle (democracy and freedom). But not the text of the constitution.

Anyway. So i'm a French Conservative guy. Also happened to have a master degree in law here. I read the US Constitution following the conference by the White House spokeswoman explaining that judges censuring Trump EO were leftist militants weaponizing justice to limit the lawful executive power of the president.

And.. how to say this. It is awfully dated and imprecise

The president really just is a referee of what the congress does. He's also commander in chief for the army and militia (militia ? WTF ?!).

It's never about an executive power the president has or executive orders can give. I guess layers and layers of court decisions had to make up for what's missing.

I also heard about the two supreme court decisions. One that said that persecuting the president for official act was a trespassing from the judiciary branch to the executive. The other that said that regulation by agencies was a denial of the legislative branch.

Everything that's missing and is needed is a legal and political battleground. So good luck with that.

If it wasn't such a gospel, you could just write it all down again with precised provisions of what the president and anyone can do, with the ways and forms technical regulations can be made.",62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1io2qip/so_i_read_the_us_constitution/,1739396825.0,1io2qip

freedom,conservative,"This isn't clickbait news, it's ""boring"", but important. USA passes 60 Million seniors, with 20 Million more in 15 years.  What is the Republican plan for senior citizens?","Maybe I'm biased, but I think our seniors (like our veterans) are too often forgotten in the media. I don't blame the media, no one likes to remember they are aging. But lately, it feels like Republican legislators are forgetting about 60 Million Americans, and if that doesn't include you yet, hopefully you live long enough to be. 

Now that the Republican Party controls both Houses and the Presidency, is there a plan for improving the wellbeing and economy for seniors?  30% are in poverty or near-poverty.  The median income for all seniors is only $29,740 per year of which $18,520 is Social Security. The financial situation isn't good, and it will get worse in only 9 years the trust fund runs out and Social Security payments will drop like 20%.  

Also health problems are getting worse, lifespan has fallen. 85% of Americans over 65 have a chronic health disease. 90% have prescriptions. 33% have a disability. 75% are overweight or obese.

And then there's a nationwide social crisis especially among seniors are increasingly isolated and spend 6+ hours a day on screens and lacking exercise, happiness, and community.  Of course this is connected to economic stress and health stress. 

What proposals do you see your Republican legislators making? What proposals would you like to see discussed?

Replied to Casty_Who : Health is a priority in my mind too. Getting rid of sugar subsidies and promoting walking and biking infrastructure is a good start. Bad urban planning and car dependency is direct with obesity. And if they're going to tariff they should prioritize taxing unhealthy foods and vehicles and toxic polluting imports.

Replied to Whole_Essay640 : There's a big myth, that I used to believe too, that people died naturally of ""old age"".  Well, you watch enough people die in real life, all the needless sad prolonging of days in poor health, and powerless over their personal autonomy, painfully waiting for an organ system to collapse, while racking up medical expenses (often at taxpayer expense), you wonder why we let our pets go to rest when its time, but human loved ones aren't allowed that grace. 

I think once older famous people from the 50s and 60s start dying and there are several national headlines that like oh say Dolly Parton was ready to go for months but doctors were forced to drag her body out to the bitter end, there will be countless heart-breaking celebrity stories that eventually enough compassion erupts to legalize an ethical secure system for dignified end of life personal freedom.

Replied to Charlestoncav : Congrats! Glad you made it to the top half of wealth. Hope you can understand why legislator's duty to protect all their constituents, including those less fortunate folks who deserve a safe healthy retirement too. Many working people can't grow wealth with the lack of affordable housing and rent inflation at record high. Also, most jobs don't allow pensions nowadays. And all it takes is bad luck, a car accident or an bad illness or a merciless scam and its all gone, not their fault, just life. I'd like to see the elected Republican crack down on scammers, the scam technology is out of control. You be extra careful with that 3/4 million! Consider supporting your local senior center, meals on wheels, and assisted living places. I like republicans for low taxes who already give directly to their community.

~

Replied to AppState1981 : Hey neighbor, go Mountaineers!  Ha Republicans don't need to degrade themselves to authoritarianism to promote healthy lifestyles, there are plenty of freedom-loving ways. Idk about making Medicare free would increase spending by billions... The removing taxes on Social Security income is intriguing. Lower it at least and perhaps redirect it to go direct into the social security fund for the seniors rather than the general IRS for everything.  Welfare won't run out of course, but so many millions of seniors are in poverty or on the edge, especially rural folks and widows, it will get ugly if poverty increases.

First solution off the top of my head concerns food nutrition.

Too much of our nutrition dependency is foreign seed oil, sugar, beef from burning down the Brazilian Amazon, and produce with terrible vitamin content they taste completely different from local foods. Support small farmers, especially young people to replace retiring old farmers (average farmer age is 58)!  Property tax cuts for new young farmers and more funding for schools that have food science and permaculture programs. At the state and local legislator level - support programs connecting high schoolers and college kids to farmers, some good old on the job education. Support 4H and similar programs. Make it harder for giant ag corportations to take over wide swaths of the our country.  Thats why the bird flu spread so bad, too many big disgusting factory producers, not enough local small chicken farmers. Food supply needs to be protected by a diversity of farming fishing and permaculture operations and heritage breeds.

As for the physical exercise part. Support starting it young, preschools shouldn't be allowed to have screens on all day. Kids sports and physical ed should be better funded. Yeah that includes disabled and trans kids too, make everyone participate, I played lots of sports all year long, including co-ed and never whined about what someone elses body was like.

tyranny,conservative,I generally agree with the right and the founding fathers but I think they're wrong about a Republic,"I love the founding fathers but I think the one thing they got wrong was making America a Republic. 

the problem with a republic is you have representatives who people vote on but they rarely govern how they campaigned. i would argue that's far more like a dictatorship than democracy could ever be and that's a common argument republic supporters make that democracy is just a defacto dictatorship

  if we could vote directly on issues, then representatives lying when they campaign and just doing what their donors want would no longer be an issue.  it would be far better for the people to get too much of what they want, than too little.  That sounds say more like we the people than a Republic could ever be regardless of how constitutional it is.  the founders where great people but I feel they screwed up there.  id much rather have a ""tyranny of the majority"".  Than a tyranny of rogue politicians

for me a constitutional democracy is the best of both worlds.  No Representatives to lie to get elected and you have a constitution to restrict voting to some degree so you cant just vote for someone to be mugged or something.  it's much of the restrictions that people like about a constitutional republic without the rogue politicians to F everything up.

No more crying about politicians lying constantly and not caring about us would certainly be a wonderful thing I think.  I also believe if the founders where alive today and saw the flaws of their system show themselves over time they would agree with me but if course no one knows that for sure    ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1mh2lhx/i_generally_agree_with_the_right_and_the_founding/,1754277241.0,1mh2lhx
tyranny,conservative,Declaration of Independence,"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ig9xvf/declaration_of_independence/,1738536147.0,1ig9xvf

https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2025/02/14/ukrainian-president-zelensky-says-he-wont-meet-with-putin-without-u-s-backed-peace-plan/

> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared on February 14 that he would not meet with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, until the United States and its European allies agree on a common plan to end the three-year-old war. Addressing U.S. reluctance regarding Ukraine’s possible accession to NATO, Zelensky said that Ukraine would need to double its army to 1.5 million personnel if membership of the Western alliance remains closed off.

He wants all of Europe to come up with a plan to save him.  He refuses to negotiate.

This is why he was not invited.  He has made it very clear.  He was not ""excluded"", or rather, he ""excluded"" himself.

https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c4g97971rwnt

>Trump - who also spoke to Zelensky by phone - has since said similar, while also insisting he knows Putin ""very well"" and trusts him when he says he wants peace.

>Zelensky, on the other hand, used today to issue world leaders a warning ""against trusting Putin’s claims of readiness to end the war"".

Zelensky has no interest in entertaining any thoughts of being at the table with Putin.  Not wrong for not trusting him per se.

>Kyiv called a proposal that Washington has developed thus far for peace in Ukraine a ""failed plan,"" saying a push for a cease-fire and elections in Ukraine isn't enough to ""intimidate"" Russian President Vladimir Putin.

>Ukraine has sought long-term security guarantees, including the potential for Western peacekeeping forces, to prevent Russia from rebuilding its forces and attacking again following a cease-fire.

Zelensky wants to *intimidate* Putin.  This is seen over and over and over in many of the various articles previous to this last week.  Zelensky wants a total win, despite not actually having a position of strength.  It is almost as if he does not understand what negotiations even are.

>“Don’t trust Putin. Don’t trust just words about ceasefire,” the Ukrainian president said, citing his own experience getting close to a peace deal with Russia in 2019 before the deal fell apart.

>Zelenskyy also said that he still thinks it's possible Ukraine could win the war militarily.

>""Of course, yes. But it's many losses,"" Zelenskyy said. ""o we understand how many. I think it's too much. And I'm not sure that with such speed. If our partners do not help, support, it will be difficult. It will be long. Longer than it can be.""

_____

Why I got here.  I keep seeing ""was excluded"" and framing Trump for all this.  It seems as if people are just absolutely gobbling up the propaganda spin on this one.

Disclaimer:  Putin started the war.  No argument that Putin is as evil as they come.

My only point is that that this is not somehow Trump's fault.  Zelensky is unwilling to try to compromise to end the war.  He only seems to want to ""end"" it by winning utterly, and short of that won't.

There are scattered reports that he *may* soften his stance, in some of the above links even, however, he comes back around to ""we can still win this!""

That is someone trying to *appear* reasonable, but still wanting to not budge one iota.

TL;DR

>Last week: No, I won't talk to them.  This week: HoW DaRe YoU SnUb Me!

fake news,conservative,"Department of Defense Paid Far-Left Newsguard $749,387 to Continue to Censor The Gateway Pundit and Conservative Media","Newsguard is a media “fact-checking” company that was started in 2018.  They claim to rate websites for reliability.  Basically, they’re in the business of deciding who is fake news and who is not.  And they HATE pro-Trump publishers and citizen journalists.  The company is supported by Trump-haters, elites and media giants.

There is ample proof the activists behind Newsguard are unhinged leftists and anti-Trumpers.

ALL of the top activists at the Newsguard organization are virulent Trump-haters.

And their mission is to DESTROY pro-Trump and conservative websites.

Breitbart.com reported on this organization and their goal to demonetize opposing voices online.

Financial Blacklisting: NewsGuard Advises Advertisers to Avoid Pro-Trump Media

NewsGuard, the news-filtering browser extension recently partnered with Microsoft and run by neoconservatives, Obama-Clinton alumni, and other assorted Trump haters, has advised advertisers to withdraw their business from websites on its blacklist of “unreliable” news websites — a list that includes Breitbart News, The Drudge Report, and the Daily Mail…

…The effect isn’t merely to silence pro-Trump media. It also ensures advertisers don’t market their products to Trump voters, causing them to rely less and less on consumers in the heartland, and more on progressive consumers who read establishment news sources.

In 2019 there was a report by La Corte News that revealed conservative sites are twice as likely to be rated unreliable as liberal publishers.

Today we found out the United States Department of Defense was using taxpayer dollars to censor conservatives and independent media online.

The DOD awarded $749,387 to Newsguard in September 2021.

Newsquard has NEVER criticized the mainstream media for lying about Trump-Russia collusion, the Hunter Biden laptop, COVID and vaccines.

From Matt Taibbi: “Some NGOs, like the GEC-funded Global Disinformation Index or the DOD-funded Newsguard, not only seek content moderation but apply subjective “risk” or “reliability” scores to media outlets, which can result in reduction in revenue. Do we want government in this role?”

Our left-wing media is completely, totally, shameless in the way they handle they handle these two stories. 

I asked one of my liberal friends, who constantly watches CNN and MSNBC and other liberal media, what he thought of *the laptop*. He hadn't heard about it - seriously. I explained the situation and he blew up ""Fox! It's all bullshit!"" Of course, I directed him to the mainstream news outlets, who have finally figured out this is a legit news story, and he texted me: ""Wow. That's bad."" 

No shit, Sherlock. Two years into this story, and he didn't even know about it. 

The left has been promulgating the idea, for many years, that censorship is not only OK, but it's important to protect our democracy. It has given them license to use ham-handed blocking of ""misinformation"", deplatforming dissenters, and more subtle techniques like shadowbanning, to prevent narratives that don't align with their political viewpoint. 

The members of this sub know full well how legitimate news stories that were deemed fake news were censored shamelessly the last decade, only to see those viewpoints vindicated months or years later, with never an apology or a mea culpa. We who value free speech have little recourse except to do what we can to move around the barricades the best we can. 

Now Musk wants to remake Twitter to be a more open platform, and the left is melting down. Their monopoly on the narrative and what is considered newsworthy is in jeopardy, and they can't stand it. 

Max Boot's reaction at the Washington post summed it up:

>""I am frightened by the impact on society and politics if Elon Musk acquires Twitter. He seems to believe that on social media anything goes. For democracy to survive, **we need more content moderation**, not less,"" \[my emphasis\]

This is exactly what they are promoting to our young people. They are being taught that we must protect the public from disinformation, from fake news, and that censorship is a great and important civic duty *when done by the correct people*. 

Recent on-the-street interviews with Russian citizens shows how effective controlling the narrative is. Person after person supported Putin's ""special military operations"" to rid the Ukrainian people of their Nazis, and to liberate them from their drug addled leaders. Of course, the interviewer could have, and probably did, cherry-picked the responses, but it's clear that a large fraction of the Russian populace is buying the bullshit. The liberals are paying attention. 

We are plummeting towards this kind of control of the news and the narrative, and in a generation (or much less) we'll probably be there. We are close now. Canada, which  is often called ""The 51st State"", is firmly in control of the narrative and their populace by the Trudeau government. Young people in our schools are being taught how to identify and combat misinformation, which of course requires action to stop it. 

For me, I hope Musk can succeed in his takeover of Twitter. Will it be enough? I doubt it. But anything that can put a chink in their censorship armor has to be a good thing.",34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/u5otbx/hunter_biden_vs_jared_kushner/,1650207679.0,u5otbx

In light of these recent events, I decided that I wanted to share my thoughts on the matter, and starting off, I’d like to say that kindness and understanding in our country, that I hold so dear, is nearly, completely dead in the water.  When we don’t know all the facts and all we have is hearsay from people, we don’t have any valuable reference point of trust for clarity and understanding in a time that should be for grief.  When all we had is footage of a good man, known for honest thought-provoking debate named Charlie Kirk being murdered.  We didn’t see him sitting on his chair shouting violent statements, advocating for violence, all we see is him speaking his mind and sharing in the knowledge he's come to possess through self-education.  We only know what they've let us know, we simply know the end result.  I don’t believe we have a full picture of what occurred yet, as his texts are still being found and more hearsay is still being spread.  What we really need is kindness and understanding from both sides of the aisle.  However, in this world we live in, people will look for any chance/any excuse/any half-baked rumor they can to feed their confirmation bias, and no matter how much evidence to the contrary their narrow mindedness persists as an ever constant.  
  
  
Now, I understand that there are some bad people on the left, just as that is the case in all positions throughout our land and the world.  However, blaming the entirety of the Left or the Right is not an honest accusation, it's a blanket statement made of self-believed falsehoods.  Blaming the entirety of any political conglomerate is such a travesty and is wholly unfounded.  When I hear that narrative on loop, I’m shocked these people can even survive day to day with the major lack of common sense and critical thinking skills, run amok.  Too many trust Main Stream Media is truthful about all things, at this juncture, and they lap up that information which feeds this mindset.  Too many trust the one-minute video of Charlie saying one thing they don't like, despite it being taken out of context and slandering his character falsely.  There is one inherent guideline when it comes to this particular continuum: “Feed the political division and instigation.  If ALL they see is political violence, then that’s all they’ll know or believe there to be.”  
  
  
Additionally, if you corner those who buy this narrative with facts and pure logic, there is no room to debate further, but instead, the self-righteousness takes over, and it turns consistently to personal attacks because their foundational argument doesn’t hold water.  It lacks because they refuse to hear anything but their own bias, media-fed, no doubt.  Your ideals, your childhood, and most of all your strength of character will come under attack because your mindset is different from theirs.  They can’t tolerate that anyone would have a different opinion about things.  Your reality is apparently different from the one they’re living. In short, these are not people you could have a civil debate with, where there is a sense of common decency retained within the conversation, unfortunately, because respect for others has been nearly lost to time.  That is something that makes people such as Charlie Kirk, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Daryl Davis such integral parts of this discussion.  
  
  
These three men possess(ed) a skill that was integral to being well-composed and truly respectable human beings in the realm of conversation and debate.  The ability to have a debate with someone rationally with persistent respect no matter the outcome is all but missing now in our society.  Even with alternate viewpoints, that foundation means everything because if that foundation can’t be built upon, then true change will never occur, and a repetitious cycle of hate and bickering will continue because no true understanding will ever be achieved through those actions.  We mustn't ever stop trying to communicate, we mustn't ever allow ourselves to devolve to rabid animals, we mustn't ever allow the true values of conversational debate on any and all subjects to die out.  For that is when we will die out.

I let them know that it was pretty ironic that they were sending me off when they based their existence on the premise of the Freedom of the Press, but I left when told to nonetheless.

Suffice to say, those in CNN will approve when other businesses are destroyed in the name of “protest,” but when their own business gets a light lampoon by tourists with a thumbs-down, they make sure to get that shut down as soon as possible.  I shouldn't have been surprised.

media bias,conservative,"Life long mostly democrat, feel like the party has moved too far left for me","This post is a bit long, hope you all don't mind. I've voted about 80-90% democrat my whole life. I grew up and live in the bay area, and my mom is a very adamant democratic voter (though for her it's a tribal thing, I don't think she cares much about the issues). I've been feeling increasingly marginalized in the party the past few years, but the past 3 months I feel like the party jumped the shark, and I don't feel like it has a place for me.

First, there's the coronavirus thing. I don't want to re-discuss that whole thing here (my comment history has my views on that topic), but it really opened my eyes to a few things. First was just the strength of media bias, and how the media latches onto a narrative and runs with it. I think the media has grossly exaggerated the danger of the virus. I'm not denying that it's deadly, but the way they've covered it is just not accurate or fair. I did lots and lots of primary source research on the topic, and the way media outlets like NYT and CNN cover it is just garbage. I don't know if Fox News or Breitbart is any better, but before I felt like NYT was a reasonably good source of news. After this episode, I just cannot trust it.

I was also just shocked by the lockdown policies my Democratic state (California) implemented, and the complete lack of debate or skepticism or anything from the general population. It completely violates individual rights with very, very limited scientific basis. I just don't understand how the governor and health officials can claim, out of the blue, the power to dictate that Walmart can open but a hair dresser cannot, or that my child must wear a mask at school, or that I can't hang out with my friends. IANAL, so I have no idea if this violates the constitution, but I kind of wonder what the fuck is the point of a constitution if these policies don't violate it.

So the whole lockdown thing made me deeply skeptical of both the media, and also just the entire party in general.

Then came the George Floyd protests and BLM. There was the obvious, blatant hypocrisy of protesting with tens of thousands of people in the middle of what was supposed to be a deadly pandemic and strict lockdown. But lets ignore that. I'm white and male, and to be honest I feel like the activist wing of the part views those as negatives, or views those as something to be ashamed of. Like the term ""white fragility""--what the fuck is that supposed to mean? I don't commit racist acts, and for whatever it matters I'm a first generation immigrant from a country that was itself oppressed by the Soviet Union in my lifetime. I don't understand why I'm supposed to bear the karmic guilt of Southern racism just because of the color of my skin.

And obviously, once you start voicing opinions like the above, you get into the thought policing that is popular in the activist wing. White people aren't allowed to express certain opinions or wrongthink. I'm a software engineer, and people in my workplace are doing weird stuff like renaming the ""master"" copy of our source code to the ""main"" copy because of imagined racial implications.

Finally, and this is not as topical, but the policies in California are just completely nuts, and very anti-business. AB5, which forces Uber/Lyft to use full time employees, will be terrible for those companies, with no benefit to the workers. Sacrament wants to micromanage the economy, and they think they can solve homelessness by throwing money at the problem. I don't think these people understand or believe in the free market.

I don't know where I'll go from here. I'll be voting for a lot more Republicans at the state level when possible. California restricts the ballot so in many cases, your choices are just 2 Democrats (!!) in the general election. Despite all this, I don't think I can vote for Trump. There's just too much to dislike. I probably identify most with Never-Trump republicans like Romney.

At the moment I feel politically homeless. The libertarian party probably is closest to my views. I'm hoping that if Trump loses in November, the Republican party will go through some changes and become a home for people like me.",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/hj5h68/life_long_mostly_democrat_feel_like_the_party_has/,1593587506.0,hj5h68
media bias,conservative,What the media won't tell you about the protests,"In the past few days, several cities have seen chaotic rioting. Cars and buildings have been torched, looting is rampant and even the Third Police Precinct in Minneapolis was burned as officers abandoned the building. More is to come.

The protests began ostensibly because of the death of George Floyd during an arrest. Systemic racism and police brutality, leftist pundits argue, is to blame.

Some leftists are claiming, as they did during the Occupy Wall Street movement, that the protests have been hijacked by a violent element intent on discrediting the movement.

Conservative commentators, on the other hand, speak of frustration and rage, of a reaction to the claustrophobia of weeks on end lockdown.

**They all miss the mark.**

**The violence since the police-involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis is an actual full blown communist insurrection—nothing more, nothing less.**
---

**Democratic Socialists of America**

In Minneapolis, the 600-comrade strong Twin Cities local of this country’s largest Marxist organization, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), has been actively supporting rioters and participating in protests.

The DSA, which works closely with Antifa-aligned groups, supported a resolution at their [national convention](https://www.dsausa.org/2019-convention-a-world-to-win/) in August to form a “National Working Group to help drive collaboration and resource sharing to support our antifascist organizing.” They say it [bluntly](https://dsabuild.org/r9-establishing-a-national-antifascist-and-direct-action-working-group): “One foot in the institutions, one foot in the streets.”

On May 27, Twin Cities DSA [issued a call](https://twitter.com/TwinCitiesDSA/status/1265774113693372417) on social media for help to comrades for “supplies” at the same intersection where an Auto Zone burnt to the ground later that evening. “Want to help out your comrades protesting the 3rd Precinct at Lake and Minnehaha?” the Marxists posted on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TwinCitiesDSA/photos/a.252330275204626/951997051904608/?type=3&theater). “Here’s a list of needed supplies from folks on the ground.”

An attached list included medical supplies along with “ply wood for shields,” “anything else useful for shielding from cops,” “tennis rackets” and “hockey sticks.” Private cars were also requested: “It sounds like another big need is people able to give rides to people who need to leave the fray.” Is this a call for private ambulances—or getaway cars?

The Twin Cities DSA ecosocialist working group [tweeted to comrades](https://twitter.com/TwinCitiesDSA/status/1266087983893090305)  “support the ongoing mass working-class uprising!”

Twin Cities DSA also tweeted: “Please also give to the TCDSA solidarity fund, because people will need help in the days and weeks ahead!” That means bail money and lawyers fees.

On May 28, the DSA National Political Committee [issued an emotionally charged and extremely biased statement](https://www.dsausa.org/statements/dsa-condemns-the-public-execution-of-george-floyd/) in support of the rioters:

>“We, the National Political Committee of the Democratic Socialists of America, condemn the public execution of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. His murder falls into the deeply entrenched pattern of violence, anti-Blackness, and oppression upheld by policing in this country. … This is white supremacy. …
>
>“Racist police violence is not incidental to the capitalist system, it is necessary to maintain its operation. We recognize that as we fight for a better world, it will be the police who threaten our protests, the police who will break up our picket lines, the police who selectively wield their monopoly on violence against Black people and working-class people to protect those with power and privilege. …
>
>“We stand with and share the rage of all those who are making themselves heard on the streets after years of being suffocated by policing and poverty, after years of being looted by corporations, landlords, and billionaires. …”

Metro Atlanta DSA was [similarly involved](https://www.facebook.com/MetroATLDSA/posts/3306637736053970) in the chaos in Atlanta.

Seattle DSA is [also involved](https://seattledsa.org/justiceforgeorgefloyd/). DSA branches in [Memphis](https://twitter.com/MemphisDSA/status/1266014548798160898) and [Los Angeles](https://www.dsa-la.org/support_floyd_protests_nationwide?fbclid=IwAR2ABFrXdVxj7HQbDJ1BEL6Zl3OBqPVj6OHKGxTO4UkLC0MsqLXNTXIpB_o) held events and are raising funds for “George Floyd Uprisings Nationwide.”


**Workers World Party**

The Stalinist–Trotskyist Workers World Party (WWP), which supports North Korea, Russia, China, Cuba, and Iran and has chapters in about 15 cities across America, is all over the protests.

WWP’s Monica Moorehead [wrote an article May 28](https://www.workers.org/2020/05/49008/) titled, “Against police violence and capitalism, to rebel is justified:”

>“Workers World salutes all the brave protesters in Minneapolis, currently ground zero against police terror. We also salute those activists in Los Angeles, Memphis and other cities who are organizing protests and braving the pandemic to be in the streets or in car caravans to show solidarity with the demand: Justice for George Floyd and all victims of police violence.”

Moorehead goes on to quote WWP founder Sam Marcy’s defense of the 1992 Los Angeles riots—in which 63 people died:

>“In times when the bourgeoisie is up against the wall, when the masses have risen suddenly and unexpectedly, the bourgeoisie gets most lyrical in abjuring violence. It conjures up all sorts of lies and deceits about the unruliness of a few among the masses as against the orderly law-abiding many.
>
>    “Marxism here again cuts through it all. The Marxist view of violence distinguishes between the violence of the oppressors as against the responsive violence of the masses. Just to be able to formulate it that way is a giant step forward, away from disgusting bourgeois praise for nonviolence. It never occurs to any of them to show that the masses have never made any real leap forward with the theory of nonviolence. Timidity never made it in history.”

**Revolutionary Communist Party**

The Maoist-leaning Revolutionary Communist Party is using the death of George Floyd to call for “a movement for an actual revolution.” They [issued communique #6](https://revcom.us/a/649/communique-6-police-murder-after-murder-after-murder-en.html) titled, “Police murder after murder after murder… To YOU who are sick and tired of the madness, and ready to be part of a movement for an ACTUAL REVOLUTION”:

>“If you’re sick of watching video after video of these murders by police … you need to … join with a movement for an actual revolution, to prepare for a time when it will be possible to lead millions to bring this system down, and replace it with a new society based on the Constitution for the New Socialist Republic in North America.”

**Party for Socialism and Liberation**

The Marxist-Leninist pro-China, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, and Russia Party for Socialism and Liberation has chapters in about 30 states. They also [seek to exploit](https://www.liberationnews.org/psl-statement-justice-for-george-floyd/) the death of George Floyd, referring to this time in history as an “absolutely critical period” to impose their vision of a communist revolution:

>“The police will always fulfill their role of being shock troops for white supremacy and capitalism as long as it exists in this racist state.
>
>“In this absolutely critical period, we sharpen our resolve to build organizations capable of waging militant class struggle against the racist state and their ruling class. … Amidst the deep crisis, the racist killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick, Georgia, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky. and Sean Reed in Indianapolis, Ind., make it clear that the protests and fight back must continue and intensify.”

**Long, Hot Summer**

Despite overwhelming and abundant evidence that communists are heavily involved in these protests and riots, very few journalists have been willing to expose the truth.

One notable exception is Antifa expert Andy Ngo:

On May 30, [Ngo tweeted](https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1266582447195488258):

>“We are witnessing glimpses of the full insurrection the far-left has been working on for decades. Within hours, militant antifa cells across the country mobilized to aid BLM rioters. The first broken window is the blood in the water for looters to move in. The fires come next.”

Ngo later added:

>“Media, politicians, public—all of us—have underestimated the training, purpose & capability of left-wing extremists. Every part of the rioting has a purpose. Fires destroy economy. Riots can overwhelm police & even military. All of it leads to a destabilized state if maintained.”

The DSA now has 66,000 members nationwide and locals in almost every state. Other communist groups such as Communist Party USA, Liberation Road, Socialist Alternative, Workers World Party, Party for Socialism and Liberation, Socialist Unity Party, and Revolutionary Communist Party and their allies in Black Lives Matter and Antifa can mobilize tens of thousands of militants and organizing cadre at short notice.

During the Ferguson riots of 2014, the pro-China Freedom Road Socialist Organization (now Liberation Road) and [its allies claim](https://roadtoliberation.org/an-in-depth-look-at-the-ferguson-eruption-organization-for-black-struggle-leader-lays-it-out/) to have brought nearly 10,000 activists into St. Louis, Missouri, to swell the ranks of the rioters.

Without the communists there would still be occasional racially charged incidents. However, all the major city-burning race riots of the 1960s (Newark, Detroit, Chicago, Watts, and many others) and every single one since have been fanned into something bigger by communist forces.

The U.S. left now has the power to start race riots in nearly every major U.S. city.

Unless forcefully countered, these current riots and protests will go on all summer up until the elections. The twin goals are to stall the U.S. economic recovery and destroy President Donald Trump. In truth these riots have nothing to do with race and everything to do with regime change and revolution.

Unless resolute action is taken, Americans are in for a long, hot summer. Revolution may be coming to a city near you.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/gva4hr/what_the_media_wont_tell_you_about_the_protests/,1591114183.0,gva4hr

Yes, you can downvote now because I called your tactic empty. Disney only pulled Kimmel from the air after Sinclair and Nexstar pulled him first. Even if ABC and Disney kept making his episodes you would still never see them because Sinclair and Nexstar have the rights to air what they want. They should be the target of your ire. 

So, see if you have a Sinclair or Nexstar station in your area. Watch the newscast and note the companies that bought TV adverts. Write and call them in mass to express how you dislike them supporting government censorship. Then you do the same to Sinclair or Nexstar. A book of stamps cost $25 dollars, since you're not paying Disney you'll have that now. Use them. If Sinclair and Nexstar get 10 million letters and if Pepsi, Ford, and Auto Zone get another 10 million someone might pay attention. Then stick to your little boycott. Just not watching Disney isn't enough, you have to go after the people that fund the local stations. So stop drinking, eating, or buying the products featured in their ads. (This is base on an Tweet by Dan Satterfield, a former meteorologists). 

I don't like how people are looking at this and understanding what it is, government censorship of a critic, then getting that this is a serious attack on our ability to stand against a man who doesn't want elections in 3 years, but they are only willing to go 1/10th of the way to doing something about it.

based,liberal,"If Trump turned on guns, would his base go along?","My husband and I have been debating this all night, and I wanted to see what other people think.

I personally support stricter gun laws, but I’m curious (and concerned) about the possibility of the Trump administration using gun control as a way to consolidate power. I worry that, over time, they could push policies designed to restrict guns in a top-down, authoritarian way… not for safety, but to control the population.

My husband vehemently disagrees. He thinks the country is too attached to the 2nd Amendment for such a move to work. At most, he says it might affect a small portion of the base but would likely cause a massive split.

I do think the base would be divided, but the pattern I’ve been seeing makes me think people could eventually accept policies that contradict previous principles. Many who were once pro–small federal government and pro–state rights have accepted policies that seem authoritarian, encroaching on individual state’s rights. Those who were anti–electric vehicles or pro–oil/gas have embraced EVs because of Trump’s support of Elon. Advocates for the Constitution and Bill of Rights have voted for leaders ignoring them. The deficit, “moral majority” beliefs, child sex trafficking rings, etc. the list can go on and on. For me, it shows that loyalty to Trump has often outweighed previous political principles.

So if Trump or his allies turned on guns to “protect the people” or “keep them away from the loony left,” I think a significant portion of his base could eventually go along with it. Not immediately, and not everyone, but slowly over time (a sort of “frog in boiling water” scenario). Authoritarian power obviously works best when resistance is minimal, and controlling guns would make that easier.

My husband isn’t convinced it would be attempted, or work if they tried… so I want to hear from others: Could Trump do this? Would he even try? And if he did, would it work",38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ndztn9/if_trump_turned_on_guns_would_his_base_go_along/,1757565881.0,1ndztn9

based,liberal,The new hiring practices put forth by the Office of Personnel Management are terrifying. (detailed analysis),"Despite the outlook of DOGE creating a smaller government by eliminating ""Unneeded"" employees , the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has released a new memo regarding all new hiring practices moving forward.

Their new memo, entitled ""Merit Hiring Plan""  
[https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/latest-memos/merit-hiring-plan/](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/latest-memos/merit-hiring-plan/)

Lays out an entirely new landscape for hiring federal employees. And current federal employees are also being  put under scrutiny regarding the yearly self-evaluations they give in favor of a skills-based test.

Under the new guidelines at the top of the memo it says:

""The American people deserve a Federal workforce dedicated to American values and efficient service. Yet, Federal hiring criteria long ago abandoned any serious need for technical skills and adherence to the Constitution. Instead, the overly complex Federal hiring system overemphasized discriminatory “equity” quotas and too often resulted in the hiring of unfit, unskilled bureaucrats. The American people, who deserve a government that works for them, have suffered.""

Later on it states:

The key elements of the following Merit Hiring Plan are:

1. Reforming the Federal recruitment process to ensure that only the most **talented, capable and patriotic Americans** are hired to the Federal service;
2. Implementing skills-based hiring, **eliminating unnecessary degree requirements**, and requiring the use of rigorous, job-related assessments to ensure candidates are selected **based on their merit and competence, not their skin color or academic pedigree;**
3. Streamlining and improving the job application process; and
4. Reducing time-to-hire to under 80 days by emphasizing the use of talent pools and shared certificates and streamlining the background check process.

I bolded the relevant sections that I find troubling.

Hiring based on merit also does not include the stipulation of being ""patriotic"" because in no way does your opinion on the country, current administration or feelings in general affect your ability to do a job. There is no way to demonstrate patrioticness to a group of hiring managers. 

Eliminating the need for degrees undervalues the well-educated and well informed, which are a majority of people who have liberal ideology. They want people to follow directions and not question why things are being done, or effectively have the mental fortitude to realize that something is wrong with what is being asked. 

This further extends to the jab at skin color which was never an overreaching ideology of DEI. It includes everyone who has an immutable quality that may cause their application or chances to be overlooked in favor of nepotism or unintentional discrimination (as not all discrimination is blatant). Because of the systematic oppression of some groups, studies have shown that white men are the ""favored"" demographic. This is a fact and whether intentional or not, these are the people that are generally seen as qualified, even when they might not always be.

The memorandum then goes on to state that applicants are meant to answer a series of essay questions that when read in the context of the current regime, is an obvious red flag for authoritarianism and apologists:    

1. How has your commitment to the Constitution and the founding principles of the United States inspired you to pursue this role within the Federal government? Provide a concrete example from professional, academic, or personal experience.  
2.  In this role, how would you use your skills and experience to improve government efficiency and effectiveness? Provide specific examples where you improved processes, reduced costs, or improved outcomes. 
3. How would you help advance the President’s Executive Orders and policy priorities in this role? 
4. Identify one or two relevant Executive Orders or policy initiatives that are significant to you, and explain how you would help implement them if hired. How has a strong work ethic contributed to your professional, academic or personal achievements? Provide one or two specific examples, and explain how those qualities would enable you to serve effectively in this position.

I won't go into great detail about these questions because they speak for themselves. The memorandum has laid out an endgame to a very obvious strategic move the government has made to stack the government irreparably in the conservatives favor. 

The playbook laid out is: 

\-Use DOGE to eliminate all of the people in power who might have ever questioned or spoke out against the current administration (recall that all of the Inspector Generals who had active investigations against Musk were terminated) And people holding government positions that are well-versed in policies and inner workings. 

\-make a boogeyman out of things like DEI or any inequality in general and humanitarian efforts to assist people who experience that oppression. (Do people who were forced to retire realize that they were part of 'DEI' since age discrimination is included?)

\-Rehire all of the people using the hiring practices put forth by the Memorandum who are uneducated, unskilled and are easily manipulated by the people in power. They do not have the people being forced to retire to mentor them and question new dangerous practices. 

It was never about saving money or smaller government. It was about stacking the government with puppets and loyalists to push a regime with little to no interference. 

This is not fearmongering. This is the reality of our situation. It has become a repetition of the history we worked so hard to avoid. ",103,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1l33aor/the_new_hiring_practices_put_forth_by_the_office/,1749037064.0,1l33aor
based,liberal,I Will Say This Until I Am Blue in the Face: Gavin Newsom Is Being Strong-Armed by the Trump Administration and We Need To Start PAYING ATTENTION,"*(no pun intended)*

I live in California. I don’t really care about Gavin Newsom one way or the other. He’s fine, whatever. But it’s obvious what’s happening, and people need to wake up. The patterns are there. This isn’t some wild conspiracy theory—this is a clear, documented strategy that authoritarian regimes use to consolidate power. The Trump administration is financially and politically strangling California, and Newsom’s sudden shift is a direct result of that pressure.

# No, This Is Not About 2028. That Excuse Is Insulting.

Some people are saying, “Oh, he’s just moderating to appeal to voters for a presidential run in 2028.” That argument makes no sense.

* He’s already one of the most high-profile Democrats in the country. He doesn’t need to pander to conservatives—he’s not some unknown politician trying to build credibility.
* A governor of California shifting right would never be believable to moderates or conservatives. No one is going to suddenly think, “Oh, Newsom is actually one of us now.” Conservatives hate California. They hate its policies, and they especially hate Newsom.
* If he wanted to appeal to moderates, he wouldn’t be aligning with fascists like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk. There’s a difference between appealing to swing voters and normalizing extremists who openly call for dismantling democracy.
* His own base is turning against him. The people who would actually vote for him in a primary—progressives, labor unions, pro-democracy activists—are all pissed off. No serious politician planning a presidential run alienates their own base for some vague appeal to “moderates.”
* And no, his ex-wife doesn’t mean anything. People love to say, “Oh, but Newsom was married to Kimberly Guilfoyle.” So what?  That was 20 years ago when politics weren't polarizing the country. She also wasn’t a raging MAGA lunatic back then. People change. Having an ex who became a fascist doesn’t mean you’re in on it. It’s just a lazy excuse to ignore the actual problem.

The idea that this is some genius political move makes zero sense. He wouldn’t tank his reputation among Democrats for an impossible play for conservatives who will never support him.

# The Trump Administration Is Actively Cutting Off Federal Support to California

This is where the real story is. While people are arguing about whether Newsom is strategizing for 2028, they’re missing the fact that Trump’s administration is financially and politically strangling California in real time.

* Wildfire aid was delayed and restricted. After the devastating wildfires, the Trump administration dragged its feet on approving FEMA relief for California while greenlighting disaster aid for Florida and Texas immediately. California had to fight for aid it was legally entitled to, while Republican-led states had no issues.
   * Source: [apnews.com/article/trump-blocks-california-wildfire-aid](http://apnews.com/article/trump-blocks-california-wildfire-aid)
* Federal jobs in California are being slashed disproportionately. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), run by Trump loyalists, is gutting federal positions, but California is taking the biggest hit. The IRS and Treasury layoffs are expected to eliminate thousands of California jobs, while other states are being impacted far less.

* Trump has a history of weaponizing federal funding. This isn’t new. Trump has repeatedly punished blue states by withholding money, including:
   * COVID relief funds that were slowed down for Democratic governors.
   * Hurricane aid for Puerto Rico that was deliberately delayed while Florida got immediate help.
   * Law enforcement funding threats against sanctuary cities.

# Newsom’s Shift Happened Overnight—Right After the Wildfire Aid Fight

* Before the fires, Newsom was loud, aggressive, and constantly attacking Trump.
* As soon as California had to beg for FEMA funding, he suddenly changed his tone.
* Instead of calling out Trump’s administration for dragging its feet, Newsom went quiet and started engaging with far-right figures like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon.
* And let’s not forget—before all this, Newsom was a staunch advocate for LGBTQ+ rights.
   * In 2022, he made California a sanctuary state for trans youth, protecting them from legal action in states with anti-trans laws.
   * In 2020, he signed a law allowing trans inmates to be housed according to their gender identity.

# This Isn’t About Newsom—It’s About Trump and the Horror Show Happening Right Now

Newsom isn’t playing chess—he’s been put in check. And if we don’t figure out why, we’re going to watch him go from a supposed Democratic powerhouse to a neutered puppet right before our eyes. And worse? It won’t just be him. They will do this to every Democratic leader until there is no real opposition left.

People need to get their heads out of their asses. Again, I’m not some staunch advocate for Gavin Newsom, but the patterns are there. It’s lazy to just brush this off and say, “Oh, he’s just another corrupt politician.” That’s the same bullshit argument that led people to fall for Trump—acting like all politicians are the same, refusing to recognize nuance, and ignoring blatant power plays when they happen.

This isn’t some conspiracy theory. Everything I’ve laid out is just facts. You don’t have to like Newsom, but you do need to start paying attention. The federal government is actively weaponizing its power against a blue state governor, and people are out here acting like this is just some normal shift to the center. Wake up.

If you refuse to see the pattern here, then you’re part of the problem. Ignoring reality because it’s easier than thinking critically is how authoritarians win. This is bigger than Newsom—this is about whether Democrats even have a future or if every single one of them will be systematically broken, controlled, or erased.

This isn’t just politics as usual. This is how democracies die. And if you’re too busy nitpicking Newsom’s character to recognize the systematic dismantling of opposition happening in real time, then congratulations—you’re exactly the kind of passive, disengaged voter that lets fascism take over.

based,liberal,It's the privatization they are after,"For the last 50 years federal employee levels have stayed stagnant even though the United States population has increased by 2/3rds.

Instead of expanding our government employee base to meet the services there has been an exponential growth in private contracting out of those services these last 50 years. 

Private contracts are where the lion's share of waste, fraud, and abuse happen in our federal government. And even if there isn't any found they still have profit margins to maintain.Profit margins that we pay for.

Privatization destroys accountability to democracy and opens the doors for bribery and political payoffs. Legal bribery since Citizens United passed in the Supreme Court. 

It's privatization that's our enemy and that's their goal right now as they dismantle our federal government. They want more. They want it all.

They are doing their best to cause mass dysfunction in the federal government so they can then tell us that ""see, the government can't do anything right and it needs to be privatized for ""efficiency"""".

They've been brainwashing the American public to hate their own federal government for the last 40 years since Reagan.

Privatization gives Wall Street access to vast pools of taxpayer money. Our money. This is theivery.

based,liberal,The Dred Scott case has no relevance to the second amendment,"It’s my understanding that gun advocates sometimes use the 1857 *Dred Scott v. Sandford* ([link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/60/393/#tab-opinion-1964281)) decision to make the argument that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns.  Just a few examples of 2A advocates making this argument are [this video](https://youtu.be/2W8sppSylVU?si=Nc8sFW1RGujByEjl&t=129), [this video](https://youtu.be/neLdsW7XZSM?si=5wz8HCrInl1s6KCi&t=605), and [this video](https://youtu.be/6vglHW9q2Ek?si=DUs36IP8dXJ6Sp6G&t=101), as well as written examples such as these: [link 1](https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=345),[ link 2](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/mcrp-journal/blog/the-second-amendment-is-racist-why-bruen-should-have-been-decided-on-equal-protection-grounds/),[ link 3](https://harvardlawreview.org/forum/vol-135/racist-gun-laws-and-the-second-amendment/).  In fact, even Justice Clarence Thomas connects *Dred Scott* to the second amendment in his opinion for *NYSRPA vs Bruen* ([link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/597/20-843/#tab-opinion-4600259)).  Most of their argument seems to stem from this excerpt from the opinion in that case written by Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney:

>More especially, it cannot be believed that the large slaveholding States regarded them as included in the word citizens, or would have consented to a Constitution which might compel them to receive them in that character from another State. For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety. **It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went.** And all of this would be done in the face of the subject race of the same color, both free and slaves, and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination among them, and endangering the peace and safety of the State.

The portion I’ve put in bold appears to be what some argue is a synopsis of the federal Bill of Rights, and the statement saying “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” appears to be a reference to the second amendment.  Gun advocates would argue that if the Supreme Court in 1857 believed that the second amendment guaranteed a citizen an individual right to keep and carry a gun, then this must also have been the traditional and authentic interpretation of that amendment.

However, I don’t understand how this argument is valid.  It seems to me that one could only come to the aforementioned conclusion if one has not actually read the context in which the above paragraph appears.  Earlier, Justice Taney had begun his opinion by presenting a list of state laws which placed explicit restrictions upon the rights and privileges of the black populations of the respective states.  These laws dated from colonial times through to the then-present day.  Taney’s reasoning was essentially that it made no sense for a “negro” that was a slave or a descendant of slaves imported from Africa to become a citizen, because the sum of all of the discriminatory and prohibitive laws that had been passed against the black populations strongly indicates that it had been the general will of the individual states to subjugate the black populations in the interest of public peace and security.  And when the individual states ratified the Constitution in order to join into a union under a federal government, the individual states vested to the federal government the protection of their peace and safety; and thus, it would be inappropriate for the federal government to betray this trust by giving citizenship to a demographic which the individual states themselves had seen fit to subjugate.  

 Among the list of discriminatory laws he mentions, the first is a 1717 law from Maryland which declared

>”that if any free negro or mulatto intermarry with any white woman, or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto woman, such negro or mulatto shall become a slave during life, excepting mulattoes born of white women, who, for such intermarriage, shall only become servants for seven years, to be disposed of as the justices of the county court where such marriage so happens shall think fit, to be applied by them towards the support of a public school within the said county. And any white man or white woman who shall intermarry as aforesaid with any negro or mulatto, such white man or white woman shall become servants during the term of seven years, and shall be disposed of by the justices as aforesaid, and be applied to the uses aforesaid.""

 Then he mentions a 1705 Massachusetts law which declared that

>""if any negro or mulatto shall presume to smite or strike any person of the English or other Christian nation, such negro or mulatto shall be severely whipped, at the discretion of the justices before whom the offender shall be convicted.""

 And another law from the same state declares

>""that none of her Majesty's English or Scottish subjects, nor of any other Christian nation, within this province, shall contract matrimony with any negro or mulatto; nor shall any person, duly authorized to solemnize marriage, presume to join any such in marriage, on pain of forfeiting the sum of fifty pounds; one moiety thereof to her Majesty, for and towards the support of the Government within this province, and the other moiety to him or them that shall inform and sue for the same, in any of her Majesty's courts of record within the province, by bill, plaint, or information.""

 He later on mentions a 1774 Connecticut provision

>by which any negro, Indian, or mulatto servant who was found wandering out of the town or place to which he belonged without a written pass such as is therein described was made liable to be seized by anyone, and taken before the next authority to be examined and delivered up to his master -- who was required to pay the charge which had accrued thereby. And a subsequent section of the same law provides that if any free negro shall travel without such pass, and shall be stopped, seized, or taken up, he shall pay all charges arising thereby. And this law was in full operation when the Constitution of the United States was adopted, and was not repealed till 1797. So that, up to that time, free negroes and mulattoes were associated with servants and slaves in the police regulations established by the laws of the State.

 And then another Connecticut law in 1833 which…

>made it penal to set up or establish any school in that State for the instruction of persons of the African race not inhabitants of the State, or to instruct or teach in any such school or institution, or board or harbor for that purpose, any such person without the previous consent in writing of the civil authority of the town in which such school or institution might be.

 Justice Taney mentions a provision in New Hampshire  in 1815, in which

>no one was permitted to be enrolled in the militia of the State but free white citizens, and the same provision is found in a subsequent collection of the laws made in 1855. Nothing could more strongly mark the entire repudiation of the African race. The alien is excluded because, being born in a foreign country, he cannot be a member of the community until he is naturalized. But why are the African race, born in the State, not permitted to share in one of the highest duties of the citizen? The answer is obvious; he is not, by the institutions and laws of the State, numbered among its people. He forms no part of the sovereignty of the State, and is not therefore called on to uphold and defend it.

 And finally he mentions an 1822 Rhode Island law

>forbidding persons who were authorized to join persons in marriage from joining in marriage any white person with any negro, Indian, or mulatto, under the penalty of two hundred dollars, and declaring all such marriages absolutely null and void, and the same law was again reenacted in its revised code of 1844. So that, down to the last-mentioned period, the strongest mark of inferiority and degradation was fastened upon the African race in that State.

 It is after his list of such restrictive and discriminatory laws that Justice Taney extrapolates that if it was the will of the states to exclude the black population from the status of citizenship within each of their respective dominions, then it is only appropriate that the same demographic be excluded from citizenship by the national government into which the respective states had vested their collective interests.  As Taney states,

>For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety.

 And then it is here where Taney states the excerpt which pro-gun advocates so often emphasize:

>It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, *and to keep and carry arms wherever they went*.

Upon looking at the larger context of this excerpt, it would seem that the excerpt doesn’t actually mean what the pro-gun advocates interpret it to mean.  First of all, it would seem that some of the items within this excerpt correlate with the prohibitive laws previously mentioned.  The first is when he mentions “the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased . . . without pass or passport . . . .”  This correlates with the aforementioned 1774 Connecticut provision that required people of color to carry a pass when wandering outside the town of their residence.  And the second correlated item is -- in my interpretation -- the infamous line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went”.   I understand this line to be an allusion to the 1815 New Hampshire law which limited the right of militia duty to only free white citizens of the state.   

Gun-rights advocates would likely interpret the latter line to refer to the text of the second amendment, and to refer to an individual right to own and carry guns for private purposes, such as self defense or sport.  However, it makes no sense for the line “to keep and carry arms wherever they went” to refer to the text of the second amendment.  Even though this line may sound similar to the line “the right of the people to keep and bear arms”, they are not the same, and the differences between the two are not at all negligible.  First of all, the second amendment refers to the right to “bear arms”, while the line from *Dred Scott* says “carry arms”.  The modern reader may simply see these two phrases as synonymous, but they are not.  The meaning of “carry arms” is straightforward, consisting of a transitive verb acting upon a noun; but the phrase “bear arms” does not actually refer to the carrying of arms, but rather is itself a phrasal verb and an idiomatic expression.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary -- the most authoritative resource on the English language -- the expression “bear arms” originated around AD 1325, and is correlated with the Latin phrase *arma ferre*, likely being simply a direct translation of the Latin.  Also according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase is defined simply as “To serve as a soldier; to fight (for a country, cause, etc.).”  The sense of the phrase ""the right to bear arms"" in the sense that pro-gun advocates typically use the phrase is, according to the Oxford dictionary, an originally and chiefly American re-definition of the phrase, originating circa 1776.  Hence, the second amendment references the right of the people to keep arms and *to fight* and/or *serve as a soldier*; while the *Dred Scott* line instead references the right to keep arms and carry arms.  

Furthermore, the *Dred Scott* line also differs from the second amendment by including the modifier “wherever they went”.  No such modifier exists in the second amendment.  In fact, the second amendment is merely a prohibitive provision, one which is applied against Congress itself, and does not directly apply any affirmative granting of rights to the people.  It makes no sense to interpret an absolute prohibition against Congress as somehow establishing a modified affirming of rights to the people.  Because of these linguistic and textual details, it is, at best, quite a stretch to claim that the phrase “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” is somehow a meaningful reference to the second amendment.

Some might alternatively argue that the line, rather than referring to the text of the second amendment specifically, is instead referring to the liberty of private gun use in general.  But what makes much more sense is that the line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went”, instead of referring to private gun use, actually refers to militia duty.  It was customary in early America for militiamen to possess arms -- such as muskets or rifles -- in their personal custody (i.e. “to keep arms”), and to literally carry them wherever they went.  We can see evidence of this from numerous militia-related laws from early America from colonial times until the 20th century.  On example is a New York law from 1640:

>ORDINANCE

>Of the Director and Council of New Netherland, providing for the Arming and mustering of the Militia in case of danger. Passed 9 May, 1640.

>\[N.Y. Col. MSS. IV. 61.\]

>The Honble Director and Council have considered it advisable to ordain that the Inhabitants residing at and around Fort Amsterdam, of what state, quality or condition soever they be, *shall each provide himself with a good gun and keep the same in good repair and at all times ready and in order*; and as they live at a distance the one from the other, every warned person is placed under his Corporal in order that in time of danger he may appear at his post with his gun. Should it happen, which God forbid, that any mischief occur either from enemies or traitors at night, the people will be notified by the discharge of three cannon fired in quick succession; and if by day, means will be found to give warning to every one, who is commanded thereupon to repair instantly to his Corporal at the place appointed and then to adopt such measures as the exigency of the case shall require, on pain of being fined Fifty guilders. \[[link](https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1640-n-y-laws-23-ordinance-of-the-director-and-council-of-new-netherland-providing-for-the-arming-and-mustering-of-the-militia-in-case-of-danger)\]

And here are a few more links to other similar militia laws:

So it would seem that with a deeper understanding of the workings of the militia during early American history, the modifier “wherever they went” should more sensibly be correlated with the common practices surrounding compulsory militia service, rather than being correlated with any sort of voluntary liberty of carrying arms for private purposes.  

The connection that the pro-gun community makes between *Dred Scott* and the second amendment is tenuous at best.  Within the passage in bold from *Dred Scott*, there are four stated civil rights: the right to travel freely without a pass, the right to freedom of speech, the right to hold public meetings on political issues, and the right to keep and carry arms.  Of these four rights, only one of them can be said to correlate directly to the Bill of Rights: the right of freedom of speech.  The rest have no connection to the Bill of Rights.  And to assume that the phrase “to keep and carry arms” is directly related to the second amendment is a stretch, since the language between the two statements has only a superficial correlation.  These stated civil rights in bold do not represent the contents of the Bill of Rights, and thus cannot be interpreted as a general reference to that document; and the phrase “to keep and carry arms wherever they went” does not represent the second amendment directly; for these reasons, there is simply no argument that this passage from *Dred Scott* supports second amendment rights.   

Of the four stated civil rights, it would appear that Justice Taney mentions two of them as allusions to previously mentioned statutes: the line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” correlates to the aforementioned 1815 New Hampshire militia law which excluded black people from militia service; and an even more obvious connection is made between the line “the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased . . . without pass or passport” and the 1774 Connecticut law requiring black people to carry a pass while traveling.  

The other two stated civil rights -- freedom of speech and the right to hold public meetings -- appear to be outliers of this pattern, as they appear to have been mentioned without any aforementioned precedent in state law.  However, there might still be a particular reason why Justice Taney saw fit to mention these particular rights.  It so happens that most of the items listed in the bolded excerpt are also stipulated in the Declaration of Rights in the 1820 Missouri State Constitution.  This is especially relevant since the *Dred Scott* case centered on whether the plaintiff was still considered a slave in the slave state of Missouri after having gained his freedom after traveling to the free state of Illinois.  Notably, the two outlier items are also addressed in the Missouri Constitution.

The statement from *Dred Scott* which says “and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak” appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 16:

>That the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and that every person may freely speak, write, and print, on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.

 And the statement “to hold public meetings upon political affairs” appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 2:

>That the people of this state have the inherent, sole, and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof, and of altering and abolishing their constitution and form of government, whenever it may be necessary to their safety and happiness.

Furthermore, in addition to their connection to the discriminatory laws already established within the text of *Dred Scott*, the remaining two items from the excerpt also appear to have correlates in the Missouri Constitution as well.  The statement about the right of a citizen “to enter every other State whenever they pleased” appears to correlate with a clause in Article 3, section 26:

>It shall be their \[the general assembly’s\] duty, as soon as may be, to pass such laws as may be necessary--1. To prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to and settling in this State, under any pretext whatsoever;

 And it also seems to correlate with Article 13, Clause 21:

> That migration from this state cannot be prohibited.

And the statement “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” appears to correlate with the state arms provision in part of Article 13, Clause 3:

>that their right to bear arms, in defense of themselves and of the state, cannot be questioned.

Compared to the second amendment, this arms provision in the Missouri Constitution seems more pertinent to the arms statement mentioned in the *Dred Scott* decision, since this provision specifically qualifies the lawful purposes for which the right to bear arms may be exercised, which the second amendment does not do.

**Conclusion**

Some might say that it only makes sense that Justice Taney is referring to the federal Bill of Rights in the bolded excerpt because he is speaking on behalf of the United States Supreme Court, which is a federal body.  However, this interpretation is uninformed.  When we look at the actual context of the *Dred Scott* decision, it is clear that the particular point that Justice Taney is making in that excerpt pertains much more to state law than to federal law.  Even though the decision that Justice Taney is making is a federal decision, he is clearly making this federal decision based on state premises.

It has never been the primary prerogative of the federal government to grant rights to American citizens.  It is state governments that have the primary authority and function of specifying and granting civil rights.  Hence, Justice Taney wasn't saying that making black people into citizens -- at the federal level -- would give them rights; his point was that federally making black people into citizens would effectively negate the prohibitive laws that the states have established in order to subjugate their black populations.  In other words, making black people into citizens would create a kind of ""double negative"" whose effect is a positive: it would not actually give them anything, but instead would *take away* the laws that *take away* their liberties.  The verbiage ""it would *give* to persons of the negro race..."" is hence metaphorical rather than literal.  It's like if a judge were to exonerate a convicted prison inmate through DNA evidence: the judge isn't actually *giving* the inmate his freedom; the judge is just *removing* his incarceration.  Thus, it is merely the result of a quirk of language and rhetoric that Justice Taney *appears* to be affirming that American citizens are entitled to the liberty to keep and carry arms wherever they go.  But for gun advocates to take this rhetoric literally, as they often do, is simply a wrong conclusion to draw

As for the content of the bolded excerpt, I can’t say how purposeful or how arbitrary this particular assortment of rights was meant to be.  At least two of the four items appear to be references to state laws which he had previously referenced, yet he breaks this pattern with the other two items, which do not have any statutory precursor in *Dred Scott*; and there are even more state laws referenced earlier that he *does not* allude to in the bolded list.  And furthermore, all of the items in the list could be said to have correlates in the 1820 Missouri Constitution; but it is not clear whether Justice Taney was actually alluding to that constitution in particular -- because of its relevance to the case at hand, or if he was referencing any other state constitution.  In summary, I don’t know exactly why Justice Taney chose the particular list of items that he chose in the bolded excerpt of his majority opinion in *Dred Scott*; however, I can say with much more confidence what this excerpt *does not* indicate.  He is not referencing the federal Bill of Rights as a whole; he is not referencing the second amendment in particular; and he is likely not referencing the general liberty of private firearm rights.  Therefore, there is no basis for pro-gun advocates to use this case as a means to argue for firearm rights.

Right now they’re telling us to “grow up”, that fighting for real reforms to improve people’s lives is “pie in the sky”, and they’re doubling down on their individualism saying “focus on yourself”, “don’t buy this or that”, “change your personal habits” while completely ignoring that Americans hate the status quo and want to the US to take a different course. 

It feels like talking to a wall. No matter what you say, liberals aren’t interested in hearing anything. It’s all black and white thinking, my way or the highway. They don’t want coalitions, they don’t want to work with working class people. Then they’re furious when they can’t turn out the vote! When their own base doesn’t even show up and they lose the election. But there’s zero reflection on how they’ve caused their own base to become numb, disillusioned, and frustrated.

based,liberal,We need to *actually* create Blue MAGA. ,"I’m being dead fucking serious. Perhaps it was my naïveté, but if you had asked me last Monday, I didn’t think we would be here. I gave the American people way too much credit. But we’re here, and the horrors have already started at an alarming rate.

I am posting this from the perspective of someone who grew up Republican and was a Republican staffer on the Hill. I’ve spent time in these spaces. Long story short- it was a long conversion process, but I went from an old school Romney/McCain type to someone who is comfortably just as leftist as AOC. However, that journey has brought me to a place where I’m increasingly infuriated that the Dems don’t seem to fully understand their enemy, nor have they demonstrated the grit needed in a moment like this.

I truly believe we are at a critical moment where the coming months could decide our fate for the rest of our lives. That fat orange fuck has vowed to reshape our country into something none of us would recognize. AND YET- Kamala conceded with barely a peep (despite some actual concerning anomalies imo), Biden is teeheeing with tangerine Hitler in the Oval Office, Warren is TWEETING about how Ol’ Donny Boy broke the law again (he’s a felon??? That’s what criminals do??? HELLO??) and NO ONE seems to be calling for the type of drastic action or leadership that is needed right now. The Republicans are stabbing us to death, and the Dems are handwringing about whether it’s ethical to punch back because “we don’t want to be like them.”

Which brings me to this: if we are to survive, if our home is to survive, we need to somehow find the means to start fighting dirty. And I’m dead fucking serious when I say we actually need a blue MAGA movement. A blue tea party movement. Activists and candidates who are populist, loud, and willing to throw every fucking dirty trick the Republicans have done over the last decade *right back in their faces.* 

I’m talking candidates who insult their opponents and attack establishment Dems on a level not yet seen before. Activists who go to elected official offices with the pure intent of creating click bait content to feed our base. Podcasters who make that little Shitler Nick Fuentes and that bald idiot Rogan look tame. A multi prong, ruthless approach, with the end goal of making the Dems cower like the MAGA fuckers cucked the Republicans. And none of this fucking infighting- everyone falls in line. Everyone supports the movement. If you don’t, you’re fair game too. 

Our country, *our home* is in danger. We need to organize and act accordingly. We need to be as ruthless and dirty and cutthroat as the Republicans have been for years. Fuck your moral high ground. Fuck your norms. If you don’t have the stomach for war, then get the fuck out of our way. Is anyone else with me?

You can only cover your tracks so much before things just start coming up. The rich aren't here to save us. Never have been never will be. A job isn't a job anymore when the boss is your government. One person loses their freedoms the rest follows. History has told us this time and time again. Cutting off trade with tariffs and reinforcing immigration will not help a country that depends on trade for survival, but it will cut us off and distance us from the world more. A liberal media purge which you all assume is fake news, or biased against your beliefs, whatever, means you get one sided, biased, misinformation 24/7. There are no checks and balances on media coverage, meaning we get a constant flood of Trumps message. What he wants us to believe. Hes already done it, who are we even kidding, most of you are so delusional and detatched from reality, this is a waste of time even explaining it, while you think that is the ""right thing for America, make America Great again"" there was never anything wrong with America before Trump.

People played dirty but they didn't play this dirty. Things that have happened over his candidacy, if you would have asked me a decade ago if anything like what hes done or said sounds like an American President, I would say no. Anyone who is old enough, sane enough, smart enough would agree. Like dude Bush was cooler than this. Republicans were different then, had more integrity. Now, as for him helping the economy, bandaid solutions to gaping wound problems. To fix the economy you have to have people who are clean off drugs, people who are EDUCATED, people who are secure, have homes, access to information and resources, this creates job growth, personal growth, and ensures the happiness and growth of your citizens. Businesses with government regulation, have limits on what they can charge, because businesses unregulated can charge whatever, claim whatever, and get off scot free with minimal consequence. What's that mean? Say you order a defibrillator for emergencies and you have a heart condition and it doesn't work, the company that sold it to you isn't liable for faulty products. Pay up. Does anyone remember company stores? Coal camps? Where businesses owned the town, made the cost of living, made the cost of goods? Miserable. Pay up.

I'm not buying it. As I look at Trump numbers, again, I see 74 million votes. That's what he had last time back in 2020. His base has not changed. Going on Joe Rogan didn't change, which, by the way, just want to say I called out Joe Rogan for being a conservative shill a long time ago. 

But I digress. Where are these extra votes going to come from? Harris still sits firmly 4 million votes behind Trump. Eat me. No way she catches up. Those 15 million other votes just stayed home. 

And I agree with the fact that they stayed home because she was a woman. Had she been a man she'd have won this election.

Misogyny is ingrained in America. THAT is why she lost. It's not because she wasn't qualified or what have you. It's because she's a woman.

She was younger, smarter, quicker, and agile... yet she lost to a senile old man who takes a crap anytime someone says something bad about him.

You will never convince me it WASN'T because she was a woman.

I say that as a white, atheist, bi man living in Idaho by the way. So if you want to question my motives for saying this. Go for it.

Edit: I see there are comments here pointing out the racism and yes, I agree, America is racist as shit. But Obama got elected. He was a man.

I asked ChatGPT how to convert people when talking about politics online 

My prompt was:

>How should I make comments online on politics if my goal is not to vent my own emotions but to convert people whether people on the fence or better yet people on the other side?

This link shows ChatGPT's response.

[ChatGPT Response](https://chatgpt.com/share/dd6d61db-0e96-4edc-810d-e56a1011293b)

I think this is a good thing to reflect on. A lot of these aren't followed often by people on our side or on the other side. Although my perception is that people on our side, liberals tend to adhere to these more than conservatives. But I will acknowledge that's just my perception gleamed from personal experiences which are anecdotes.

The points ChatGPT made are listed below. Note that in the response there are more details under each point. For the sake of brevity I didn't quote the entire thing, but it's a relatively short read. I recommend going to the link I provided and reading it.

>1. **Be Respectful and Civil**

>5. **Ask Questions**

>6. **Use Empathy**

>8. **Stay Informed and Updated**

>9. **Use Positive Framing**

>10. **Tailor Your Message**  




ChatGPT also provided an example:

>Instead of saying: ""Your stance on climate change is ignorant and harmful.""

>Try: ""I used to be skeptical about climate change too, but after looking into the scientific evidence from sources like NASA and the IPCC, I realized how serious the issue is. What sources do you rely on for information about climate change?""

I know it's just a Large Language Model and ChatGPT isn't always accurate, but I feel like when I think about these they're common sense. I feel like the more people apply these principles the more successful they'll be in promoting their views.

There has been some progress in a few states by changing to a ranked voting style system instead of the winner takes all. (I think ranked voting allows for a somewhat better representative government)

I wonder if there is any possibility of redefining districts to be ummmm like, an opt-in representation district or an ideological district, instead of a physical location based district.

The Senate already kinda works that way, each state has two senators which represent the whole of the state. The House has apportioned representation based on population, but effectively, the elected officials represent the whole of the state anyway.

I think a system where BOTH senate seats being up for election in the same cycle with ranked voting virtually guarantees the two largest voting blocks each are represented in government, instead of each seat being won by a single party during different cycles with a slim majority.

The House would also either have all of its seats up for election in the same cycle (if state has a number of reps under 3 total) or could be split between two cycles (if the state has 4 or more total reps)

I’ve shared with him things that gave him the ‘leg up’. That he had a place to go back to with our parents when things went bad in his life so he could get a bearing and move forward.

He doesn’t agree. He thinks he’s worked hard and deserves what he got. I know that others agave also works hard but do not get the opportunities he has. 

He thinks that the problem with blacks is they grow up without a male parent and that blacks disproportionately commit a larger percent of crime. I tried to argue that our justice system unjustly incarcerates people of color which affects families.

based,liberal,Could randomly choosing people to serve in government be the best way to select our politicians?,"I'm a huge advocate of something known as **[sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition)**, where people are randomly selected to serve in a legislature. Unfortunately the typical gut reaction against sortition is bewilderment and skepticism. How could we possibly trust ignorant, stupid, normal people to become our leaders? 


# Democracy by Lottery

**Imagine a Congress that actually looks like America. It's filled with nurses, farmers, engineers, waitresses, teachers, accountants, pastors, soldiers, stay-at-home-parents, and retirees. They are conservatives, liberals, and moderates from all parts of the country and all walks of life.**

In the most commonly discussed implementation of sortition, lottery would be used to construct a legislature. Random sampling would be used to draw around 100 to 1000 people to form a house of Congress. Service would be voluntary, for a fixed term, and be well paid. From there, the selected people would have the responsibilities and powers of any elected legislature. These sorts of legislatures would have substantial advantages against elected ones:

* Because of [random sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_\(statistics\)), a sortition Citizens' Assembly would have superior diversity in every conceivable dimension compared to any elected system, including race, class, sex, religion, ideology, cognitive ability, profession, and anything else you can think of. Sortition is therefore the ultimate method of creating a [proportionally representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) Congress. 
* Without the threat of elections demanding ideological purity, a sortition assembly is better able to compromise with their fellow citizens and reach consensus. 
* Without the need for elections, legislators no longer need to waste time campaigning but can rather focus their time on their actual job.
* Legal bribery in the form of campaign donations is eliminated. 
* The nature of lottery creates a more egalitarian Congress ruled by regular people rather than the elites of society. 
* The nature of lottery possibly crushes the formation of political parties - parties that often form due to strategic campaigning needs to win elections. 



# Real World Evidence

Sortition is not a shower-thought. Sortition is thousands of years old and is the topic of active investigation by political scientists. Hundreds of sortition-based [Citizens' Assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) across the world have already been conducted. The decisions they have come to have been of high quality in my opinion. For example:

 * The BC Columbia Citizens Assembly was tasked with designing a new electoral system to replace the old [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) (FPTP) system. The organizers brought in university experts. The organizers also allowed citizens, lobbyists, and interest groups to speak and lobby. Assembly members listened to all the sides, and they decided that the lobbyists were mostly bullshit, and they decided that even though the university experts had biases, they were more trustworthy. This assembly ultimately, nearly unanimously decided that Canada ought to switch to a [Single-Transferable-Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) style election system. They were also nearly unanimous in that they believed FPTP voting needed to be changed. This assembly demonstrates the ability of normal people to learn and make decisions on complex topics. 
 * In [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Assembly_\(Ireland\)), Citizen Assemblies were instrumental in the legalization of both gay marriage and abortion in a traditionally Catholic country. These assemblies were used to resolve politically volatile subjects so that fearful politicians would not have to. 
 * Recent 2019-2020 Citizen Assemblies in Ireland and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Convention_for_Climate) reached consensus on sweeping, broad reforms to fight climate change. In Ireland taxes on carbon and meat were broadly approved. In France the People decided to criminalize ""ecocide"", raise carbon taxes, and introduce regulations in transportation and agriculture. Liberal or conservative, left or right, near unanimous decisions were made on many of these proposals.
 * [America in One Room](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/opinion/america-one-room-experiment.html) deliberative polling experiments have demonstrated the ability of regular Americans to deliberate amongst one another and come to compromises. 

The usage of sortition has also been documented in many societies:

* The greatest known example of sortition is its use in ancient Athens, where lottery was used to select magistrates, legislative councils, and the People's Court. 
* Sortition was also used in combination with elections for the selection of leadership in Renaissance-era Italian City States such as a Venice and Florence. 
* Examples of sortition have also been documented to be used in [Indian tribes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dech.12651). In these tribes, sortition results in an egalitarian government where power is shared. When elections were introduced into these societies however, the author observed the rise in power hierarchies and even ""toxic masculinity"". 


In these societies, you will find echoes of the claims I made above. Political parties in these societies are weak. Concentrations of power are reduced. 

# Comparing to Elections

All electoral methods are a system of choosing a ""natural aristocracy"" of societal elites. This has been claimed by philosophers such as Aristotle since ancient Greek elections 2400 years ago. Elections are biased in favor of those with wealth, affluence, and power. 

Moreover all voters, including you and me, are [rationally ignorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance). We don't have the time nor resources to adequately monitor and manage our politicians. On average we vote ignorantly, oftentimes solely due to party affiliation, or the name or gender of the candidate, rather than actual qualification. We assume *somebody else* is doing the monitoring, and hopefully we'd read about it in the news. And yes, it is somebody else. Marketers, advertisers, lobbyists, and specialists pay huge sums of money to influence your opinion and construct your news reality. Every elections is a hope that we can refine our ignorance into competence. IN CONTRAST, in sortition, normal citizens are given the time, resources, and education to become informed using the process of [deliberative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy). Normal citizens are given the opportunity to deliberate with one another and come to compromise. IN CONTRAST, politicians constantly refuse to compromise for fear of upsetting ignorant voters - voters who did not have the time nor opportunity to research the issues in depth. Our modern, shallow, ignorant management of politicians has led to an era of unprecedented polarization, deadlock, and government ineptitude. 


# Implementations

There are many forms which sortition could take. I list some from least to most extreme:

* The least extreme is the use of Citizen Assemblies or Deliberative Polling in an advisory capacity for legislatures or referendums. Examples of these have been implemented in Ireland, the UK, France. They have also been implemented in Oregon in the form of ""Citizens Initiative Review"" (CIR). Here, a random body of Oregonians are tasked with reviewing ballot propositions and giving referendum voters information about the propositions. 
* A hybrid, two-house Congress has been proposed where one house is chosen by lottery while the other remains elected. This system attempts to balance the pro's and con's of both sortition and election, and use both as checks and balances against each other.
* Random sortition legislators can also be added to existing parliamentary bodies to complement, rather than veto, the decision making capabilities of elected officials. 
* Rather than have citizens directly govern, random citizens can be used exclusively as intermediaries to elect and fire politicians as a sort of electoral college. The benefit here is that citizens are given the time and resources to deploy a traditional hiring & managing procedure to make political appointments. This system removes the typical criticism that you can't trust normal people to govern and write laws.
* Most radically, [multi-body sortition](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/428/) constructs checks and balances by creating several sortition bodies - one decides on what issues to tackle, one makes proposals, one decides on proposals, one selects the bureaucracy, etc, and completely eliminates elected office. 



# The History of Sortition
Democratic lotteries are an ancient idea whose usage is first recorded in ancient Athens in 6th century BC. Athens was most famous for its People's Assembly, in which any citizen could participate (and was paid to participate) in direct democracy. However, the Athenians also invented several additional institutions as checks and balances on the passions of the People's Assembly.

* First, the Council of 500, or the Boule, were 500 citizens chosen by lottery. This group developed legislative proposals and organized the People’s Assemblies.
* In addition, lottery was used to choose the composition of the People’s Court, which would check the legality of decisions made by the People’s Assembly. 
* Most government officials were chosen by lottery from a preselected group to make up the Magistracies of Athens. 
Athens used a mixture of both election and lottery to compose their government. Positions of strategic importance, such as Generals, were elected. 

## Historical Beliefs about Democracy 

Athenian democracy was regarded by Aristotle as a “radical democracy”, a state which practiced the maxim “To be ruled and rule by turns” [2 pp. 71]. For Aristotle, “It is accepted as democratic when public offices are allocated by lot; and as oligarchic when they are filled by election.” 

Renaissance writers thought so too. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu states, “Voting by lot is the nature of democracy; voting by choice is in the nature of aristocracy.”

How is it that ancient and Renaissance philosophers understood democracy to be selection by lottery, while modern people understand democracy to be a system of elections? Democracy was redefined by Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville while he travelled through the United States in the early 1800’s. Tocqueville was impressed by the equality of the social and economic conditions of Americans in the early years of the republic. Importantly, Tocqueville believed that the institutions of American “township democracy”, law, and the practice of the tyranny of the majority made America a land of democracy. Therefore he wrote and titled a book, *Democracy in America*, that redefined America as a democracy rather than the aristocratic republic which its founding fathers had desired. Tocqueville’s book would become a best-seller around the world. 

With Tocqueville’s redefinition of democracy that excluded the practice of lot, the traditions of democracy were forgotten and replaced with the electoral fundamentalism of today. From historican & advocate David Reybrouck, 

> “Electoral fundamentalism is an unshakeable belief in the idea that democracy is inconceivable without elections and elections are a necessary and fundamental precondition when speaking of democracy. Electoral fundamentalists refuse to regard elections as a means of taking part in democracy, seeing them instead as an end in themselves, as a holy doctrine with an intrinsic, inalienable value.” [1 pp 39].



# Concluding Remarks

There are many legitimate arguments against sortition, and these philosophical arguments have been waged for thousands of years since democracy's invention. We might assume that yes, there are superior people, and that the superior ought to lead the inferior irrespective of the inferiors' wishes. If you believe in this kind of superiority, democracy is not for you, and elections aren't for you either (How ridiculous is it to ask the inferior to select the superior!). But if you do believe in democracy, if you believe that people ought to govern over themselves, then I think you need to take sortition seriously as a way to enhance democracy and finally take it to the 21st century.

based,liberal,Shit Trump did. An essay,"

I wanted Warren. I wanted Bernie over Biden. I wanted several candidates more than Biden. Nonetheless:

**2020 is SO much bigger than Biden**

A 2020 Trump Presidency would mean:

- A conservative judiciary the *rest of your life.* A likely 7-2 SCOTUS, and another of lifetime federal judge appointments.

This means unfavorable rulings for: climate change, abortion, gerrymandering, executive power, executive oversight, Congressional authority, civil rights, immigration issues (children in cages), and so, so much more. You can basically say goodbye to this for decades to come with a Trump Presidency. Everything Bernie, Warren, Democrats, and progressives ever stood for is going to take a sledgehammer with a Trump Presidency.

- It would mean the continuing takeover of an authoritarian rule. Trump has argued he is immune from indictments, from oversight, from the courts, and he has a DOJ and Republican Senate to help him solidify his role as America's King.

- It would mean further emboldening of a worrying white nationalist, conspiratorial presence in America. Racism, sexism, xenophobia, wild conspiracies, and more would be given a green light.

- The continued isolation of America on the world stage. Every country on the planet besides NK, Saudi Arabia, and Russia does. not. trust. us. anymore. We are a mockery on the world stage in everything we do.

- The most corrupt cabinet in history. William Barr, Betsy DeVos, Mnuchin, Wheeler, Pence. It's like a super team of unqualified, horrendous people with enormous conflicts of interest. Every position is basically hired to deconstruct the agency they work for. The intelligence community is being flat-out purged for loyalists.

- A continuing WAR against climate change efforts and science. Undoubtedly the biggest issue humanity, including our children, grandchildren, and beyond will face.

No matter what your criticisms of Biden are,  

Let's remember who Trump is:

-Trump defrauded the government of [$400 million dollars.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=4C8152465110DAFBB00CA5F605A32C11&gwt=pay&assetType=REGIWALL)

At the end of the day, we have a choice to make in November as reasonable adults and Americans. 





President Trump is corrupt and has surrounded himself with corrupt criminals. Here is a growing list of criminal investigations and convictions into President Trump and his associates. This is America under his leadership;

- 1) **Trump Foundation was forced to dissolve and court ordered to pay $2 million for misusing charity funds for personal use:** The president's charity was investigated for misusing the charity for personal gain.^[[1]](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/14/new-york-ag-files-lawsuit-against-trump-foundation-for-alleged-illegal-conduct-trump-says-wont-settle.html) The Trump Foundation dissolved following an investigation led by the New York Attorney General.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/nyregion/ny-ag-underwood-trump-foundation.html) President Trump was ordered to pay $2 million for misusing funds.^[[3]](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/07/777287610/judge-says-trump-must-pay-2-million-over-misuse-of-foundation-funds)

>""The Trump Foundation has shut down, funds that were illegally misused are being restored, the president will be subject to ongoing supervision by my office, and the Trump children had to undergo compulsory training to ensure this type of illegal activity never takes place again,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office filed the case, said in a statement. ""The court's decision, together with the settlements we negotiated, are a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain.""

>*Pg. 11*

>During the campaign, Cohen played a central role in two similar schemes to purchase the rights to stories - each from women who claimed to have had an affair with Individual-1 - so as to suppress the stories and thereby prevent them from influencing the election. With respect to both payments, Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election. Cohen coordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of payments. In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1.

based,liberal,"Counter points about hating ""Government""","A government is  the governing body of a nation, state, or community. 

&#x200B;

It's that simple. It doesn't matter where you go, the moment more than one person is working together there is some kind of government at play.   


Today on Ask Trump Supporters, a question was posed asking when does the government best the private sector. Incredibly, the most common response is the Military. That command economy merit based society with high training, welfare, hands on management, held accountable, regulated faction of the United States that commands floating cities with more airpower than most nations in the world, and global reach.    


Ask for examples.  
When talking to anyone trying to sell you that the private, plutocratic, invisible hand mentality is the best way to go, ask for examples in real life and history. Because at no time in history did a plutocratic/ corporate society held out for long before the economy stagnated and corruption rotted that system of government to the ground. 

&#x200B;

The best reasons to have an organized governing structure is accountability, anti-corruption, data tiered data analysis of the people and resources, and bulk purchases of goods and services to supply to the public and prepare for disasters and issues. 

&#x200B;

**Explain basic civics.**   
There are generally two axis to most government types. Power and authority on one, wealth and economy on the other. 

&#x200B;

With power and authority, three of the most basic examples are easily explained as starting points. A single ruler (Monarch, Dictator), a layered rule (Republic, leader based), and a rule by the people (Democracy). Each with advantages and disadvantages.  


[https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher\_lessons/3branches/1.htm](https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher_lessons/3branches/1.htm)

&#x200B;

**A King.**

A single ruler is quick and easy. Fast and effective. However is quicker to corrupt and pursuaid into making bad decisions, especially when they believe they are the best of the best because of the seat of power they hold. In the States, we have the president who is elected mostly by the general population to fill this role, and can act as a dictator in times of emergencies and crisis. Because an imperfect action is often better than no action at all.

&#x200B;

**Representatives**

A layered rule such as a Republic or some kind of body of leaders offers better information and management of specialized tasks and responsibilities. It requires more effort to corrupt and distort as hopefully merit based and elected officials will have a shared say, and have to discuss with peers for actions. It also means they are held accountable by their peers if embezzlement or criminal activity is pursued or carried out. In the states we have Congress and the Senet. Elected into office by groups of people to represent them. 

&#x200B;

**Rule by all**

A total democracy is a full rule by the people, it's slow and a fools vote is equal to a scholar. Democracy is determined by how accountable the government is to the people, and whether or not the government reflect the populations best interest, or is corrupt and serving other powers such as a foreign body or corruption. 

&#x200B;

**Wealth & Economy**  
This is where Conservatives will tell you the government fails at most. Spending other people's money is the worst way to go about things and should be avoided at all cost and try to sell you that private business is the best way to go. I have no examples of when privatization was better than an uncorrupted government once funding was factored in. Every project in history performed best when it was given resources, proper management, and was held accountable. 

&#x200B;

**Economic Anarchy**  
Free Market and the invisible hand. Where the wealth is, incentives follow. No regulations or management is taken into account and theft against the poor and powerless via slavery is quick to take effect. Workers can't defend themselves against an organized power with money and marshal forces so they are limited to basic work. Micro empires rise as corporations, but in every instance, the most organized, regulated groups of people take over and the Freemarket disappears. It is the line when the greed get too greedy, paranoid, and are overthrown. The fall of Capitalism is when consumers are bankrupt and the wealthy blame them for it.

&#x200B;

**Command Economies, Socialism & Communism.**

The very moment control is taken to manage resources is when a command economy takes shape. Socialism is where the governing body takes control of some or all services to enable the public to perform well, by mass managing, bulk buying and problem prevention through trends and analysis goods and services such as roads, military, disaster response, emergency response, medical, financial safety nets, disability management, and so on. The last elements to be taken over and the push into Communism occurs when luxury services and economic caps are put in place to regulate the wealthy and prevent them from becoming too powerful to manage, and leave ruin the state. 

&#x200B;

**Examples**

We have many examples in history regarding the private sector taking over, and the moment a business opens shares to the public, workers comp and investments drop. The moment pro-profit healthcare was allowed under Reagan, we saw healthcare costs increase. When we look at public and private schools, the biggest factor is money. Public schools that are well funded and regulated perform just as well as private schools.   


In the United States, we have cities that specialize and perform better due to the focused mindset than if they were attempting to be jack of all trades social centers. Unless you seriously think everyone should design and build their own car from scratch, it's a very good idea that we have predictable settings such as roads that are maintained for specialized vehicles to operate on, designed by people who specialize in vehicular design. They couldn't design those cars if they were too busy farming and training in a militia. 

&#x200B;

**My final thoughts ranting about this**

The only people who are trying to tell us the government is bad are people who are either ignorant of basic civics, economics, and history to know better, or are lying and trying to sell mass privatization to fleece the population of power and wealth.   


This has been a rant that is my observation and understanding to explain what the fuck a government is, because this argument is beyond stupid by now. I hope better people chime in here to correct and refine my attempt here. To create a post that can be easily linked to for educational purposes as to what the hell government is and why its used. Accountability and management.   


If you read this and hate the government, I honestly hope you chime in with outstanding examples of how the private sector, with the same economic resources, outperformed a managed government organization. Because as we have so far, Governments landed on the moon,[invented the computer](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000984.htm), built roads in Roman times, and as we see in the Military, are capable of identifying and applying organizational practices that give us the most bang for the buck. The only modern examples I can think of would be the fact that [NASA needs more funding.](https://www.21stcentech.com/money-spent-nasa-not-waste/)

&#x200B;

So when you try to tell me that Government is stupid, or some other nonsense, I'm going to need you to clarify. Because as far as I'm concerned, corruption is the problem, and Conservatives don't hate organizations, they hate being held accountable and having regulations keep them in check from making money off the suffering of others.  


As usual, I'm going to post something I picked up somewhere. Two links that show how Conservatives are the problem in America, and I have yet to see anything that counter discusses this.

About how Nixon's Detente (his ending of hostilities with Russia) was sabotaged, resulting in U.S. taxpayers paying a huge price in Trillions & Trillions of tax dollars given 2 scheming ""Defense"" industry","""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA""; By Anne Hessing Cahn

Book review in the ""Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists"" January, 1999

No. 1, Vol. 55; Pg. 70

By Warnke, Paul C. (reviewer)

Killing Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.

In presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)

Shortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly **overstating** Soviet military expenditures. **[WhereIsFiber's note: The Soviets, now the Russians, have always spent a small fraction on defense compared to our wildly wasteful U.S. ""Defense"" budgets. The USA spends on ""Defense"" what the next 12 countries combined spend on defense. That's why our economy is just limping along and our national debt has skyrocketed to 19 Trillion, and dangerously rising.]**

In late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by ""projecting a sense of complacency."" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.

The initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.

The navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.

Whatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by ""independent"" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.

As the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the ""intellectual godfather"" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. **[My note: This is laughable.]** In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the ""intensity, scope, and implicit threat"" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that ""Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded."" **[Note: Haha, if you're going to waste Trillions of U.S. taxpayers' money on ""Defense,"" you need a big boogeyman/bogeyman, a scary ""enemy,"" a phantom menace. The reality is the U.S. foisted the Cold War on the Russians.  The Russians wanted to be our ally, just like the French are our ally.  In fact, the Russians were our allies during World War 2 against the Nazis.  After World War 2, U.S. war mongers started the Cold War against Russia.  No less than double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling has said the Soviets/Russians did not want the Cold War.]**

It is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.

Detente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.

Although the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided ""intellectual fodder"" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that ""the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup."" **[Lol. You accuse your ""enemy"" of what you, yourself, are most guilty.]** The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, ""has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated from a single center--Moscow."" **[The jokes keep coming.]**

Not surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

Fortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.

Although detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, **[this book was published in 1998 during Bill Clinton's presidency, so, no, detente did not survive the Bush/Cheney regime and the ""Project For a New American Century,"" the 21st Century's equivalent of the anti-Nixon, anti-detente ""Team B"" liars]** the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.

""Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA"" author Anne Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But it is the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.

Previously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.

Paul C. Warnke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., was director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and chief arms negotiator in the Carter administration, and assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs in the Johnson administration.

woke,liberal,I have quit the right wing and being anti woke,"Why I Stopped being Anti-Woke

Let me begin by saying I am a staunch supporter of some right wing principles still, like economics and anti cancel culture and free speech absolutism but I will admit, I quit the anti woke movement.

Let me just say, I was super super far right and like, while thankfully it never hit a violent space, I used to be the type of guy who would listen to Tim pool and Alex Jones. These people were my absolute favourite and I always justified it by saying they were not homophobic or transphobic, cause maybe they had Blaire white (still love you Blaire white, your different), but I quickly noticed something disturbing .

They are bigots who hate being called bigots. Straight up, if you watch any video, they hate labels like transphobe, homophobe or racist and their standard for being one is so so so high like if you don't say directly ""I don't want the death of this XYZ minority"" you are not one. 


And another issue, they will deny objective reality in the face of preserving their narrative. I was watching a video by Matt Walsh, he was explaining what happened to Jonathan joose wasn't a homophobic hate crime, and the comments were so repulsive, they accused his husband of faking it. His husband was killed and their dogs dead head was in the mail.


Plus, I notice they value personal anecdotes over reality. I saw people claim there were no guns shot at January 6. I saw the videos with my own videos there were, certainly guns. Also what is truly worse, the weaponisation of labels when they need it against a minority!

They want to fight Muslims! They cry anti semetism and will discuss how Muslim migration will harm LGBT communities


They want to fight trans people! They cry women's rights but will cry DEI at the hiring of a women!

They want to fight LGBT people! Now the fact that people reading gay books hurts Muslims and Now, the opinions of Muslims matter.

On the final point.its truly became a 'you become what you hate movement"". What I noticed there is no difference between Andy pants sonic and some one like Anita Sarkissian. They both watch media and find something to scream about. Before it was people who boycott movies due to lack of black characters, now its people boycotting beer for collabing with trans women. Worse, they will watch any movie and scream it's woke, they cannot enjoy movies and comics cause their looking for woke.

And trust me, movies are just that movies if you don't give a shit if their woke or not. ",262,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1m5oa4h/i_have_quit_the_right_wing_and_being_anti_woke/,1753116906.0,1m5oa4h
woke,liberal,Where will we land with all the parents vs. educators culture wars?,"Once upon a time, parents and teachers were mostly allies. It's tiring to hear about one after another parental vigilante group go ""how dare you teach my child! We want parental involvement!!""

It's like it never leaves the news cycle these days. God forbid the whitewashed American historical narrative is updated! The latest iteration is libraries and drag queens.

Just as ""woke"" was co-opted by the right for ironic derision, it could be argued that ""politically correct"" has taken on a new additional meaning in the 2020s.

These helicopter parents aren't the traditional, stodgy Silent Generation/Baby Boomer parents depicted in 1980s teen movies. They *were* the kids in those movies: primarily Gen X, and, increasingly, Millennials. Why are these younger generations more sensitive/""concerned"" with their children's education? Is it just smart PR on the part of conservatives: ""no one can argue with wanting the best for and protecting children""?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/11r9ruu/where_will_we_land_with_all_the_parents_vs/,1678808991.0,11r9ruu
woke,liberal,29 fewer citizens (An Open Letter),"&#x200B;

We woke this morning with 29 fewer citizens in this country then we had this time Friday. 29 fewer people will greet their loved ones at the door after coming home from work or school. 29 separate empty spaces in hearts, in families, in communities, 29 empty positions at the office and desks at school, 29 I Love Yous that won't get a reply, 29 circles of friends who are missing someone, 29 memories that won't be made, 29 laughs silenced, 29 hugs not given, 29 voices now unheard, 29 experiences never to be had, 29 lives left incomplete, and countless others mourning them. 

When is it enough? When is it enough Senator McConnell, when is it enough? Republican Party? When is it enough? Legislators, Governors, and Officials? How much more blood needs to be spilled before you're willing to acknowledge the problem. Are we asking for too much? Everyone who buys a firearm, anywhere in the United States should have a background check to ensure they are safe to have a firearm, No one who has prior records of domestic violence or serious mental illness should have access to firearms, and No one should be given legal access to bump stocks to make that weapon more dangerous and deadly, and the investment in smart arms that would ensure limited access to the weapons being sold to the public. Most all of us are pretty agreed on at least these steps. So where are all you people who can do something about it? Even if you get voted out in the next election at least passing these kinds of measures will be doing something to make the lives of the public better. Getting voted out for the right reason, because you did a good thing that you can take pride in. You love to hail the bravery and sacrifice of others, but lack the conviction to make sacrifices yourselves. Doing something, not just thinking and praying will be what makes the world a little better, and isn't that why its called public service in the first place?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/clz1yt/29_fewer_citizens_an_open_letter/,1564940087.0,clz1yt

traitor,liberal,A list of all the terrible things Donald Trump has done (and a few good things he has done to keep the Trumpkins happy),"Alright before I list the fucking horrible things Trump did as president, I am first going to list the good things he has done:

- He made several peace deals between Middle eastern countries and Israel.

- He made it possible for prescription drugs to be imported from foreign countries for a cheaper price.

- He repealed the ""three strikes you're out"" law, where if someone commits the same crime three times, they are sentenced to life in prison without a trial or parole. The day before Biden would become President, he pardoned several victims of this unjust law.

Alright, now it is time for me to show you his true colors:

- He revoked Obama's ban on waterboarding, an extremely controversial and inhumane form of torture used to gain information from criminals. Several studies have proven that waterboarding is ineffective.

- He banned Muslims from being able to enter the country from 2016-2018. 

- He withdrew the country from the WHO.

- He downplayed the COVID pandemic in its early stages, prioritizing the economy over human lives. This resulted in 400,000 people dying due to COVID.

- In a press conference, Trump suggested people inject bleach into themselves in order to ""cure"" themselves of Covid.

- Trump abolished the Affordable Care Act, resulting in over 30 million Americans losing their health care. 

- Trump revoked LGBT protections in health care, education and the workplace, allowing discrimination to take place. He also banned same-sex marriage in the military.

- Trump introduced insane tax cuts on the rich, basically having them pay nothing.

- Trump pardoned several traitors, including those who are agents of countries who are our enemies.

- Trump gave funds to the king of Saudi Arabia so they can bomb cities in Yemen.

- Trump pulled soldiers out of northern Syria after a phone call with the president of Turkey. Turkey then invaded Syria, committing several atrocities and almost spiraling NATO into a proxy war with Russia.

- Trump covered up reports of Russian agents placing bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan.

- Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord

- Trump encouraged an armed insurrection on the US Capitol building.

- Trump played a game of chicken with the dictator of North Korea, almost spiraling the US into a nuclear war with North Korea.

- Trump made a ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN"" tweet in the Summer, while COVID was in full swing. This resulted in far-right white supremacists attempting to kidnap the governor of Michigan.

- Trump quoted Benito Mussolini in a tweet.

- He boasted about how Trump Tower was the tallest building in Lower Manhattan after the 9-11 terrorist attacks.

- Trump hid his tax returns for four years.

- Trump made a remark about how there are ""fine people on both sides"" after a violent white supremacist riot took place in Charlottesville, resulting in a little girl getting shot.

- Trump separated families at the border, and allowed ICE to sterilize migrant women. He then bribed fact-checkers to dismiss these as being taken out of context.

- Trump started drilling oil in an area of Alaska previously marked as being preserved for wildlife reasons. Now that oil is being drilled, hunting of animals in this area is legal.

patriot,liberal,I asked it before but where the fuck is the media presenting an alternative vision to this right-wing blitz?,"The right wing have their media army, conditioning their followers with buzzwords like ""critical thinking"" and ""DEI,"" but everything Trump is doing is like a direct attack on everything it means to be American, where is the media that actually outlines this? Or the importance of our system of government? The importance of checks and balances?

I can almost understand why low-information people get seduced by right wing media, there simply is no other media source in 2025 that educates viewers or readers on the mythology of this country.

I mean, I guess I'm just remembering things I read as a kid, like the whole ""streets are paved in gold"" thing, and bygone talking points about our country from generations past. But I don't hear these viewpoints anywhere, touting the true goodness of this country and its shared heritage. The creation of the national parks, defending democracy in WW2, the importance of things like due process or an independent judiciary... I swear when I was a kid in the 1990s there were widely spread talking points around these things. It was more baked in to the collective consciousness the importance of democratic values.

But I don't hear these perspectives anymore, from either side. For something to get into the collective consciousness and battle the right wing doublethink onslaught, it has to be readily available for people to watch again and again. Tucker Carlson's spinning his narrative night after night, so are many other shock jock-level news entertainers who are selling out the delicate soft power and shared culture of this country's governance. 

But is there anyone left who actually feels a shred of genuine patriotism over our democratic values and shared history? Where are these media sources that talk about *why* the things that are being cut and destroyed are important, and why we'll miss them later? 

I've looked through liberal sources (am proud liberal who just doesn't watch much political news anymore) and all I really see is people reacting to conservatives, or maybe wringing their hands about Palestine, a country that is NOT the United States. Is *anyone* actually talking in mass media, night after night, about the promise of this country, of what is possible with effective government? 

Has the whole political debate shrunk down to literally just ""let's destroy ourselves"" vs ""let's only destroy ourselves a little bit""?? Is no one with a megaphone really advancing a *positive* perspective of how the economy could work better for average people, or the benefits of investing in single payer healthcare and infrastructure? Or why it's a bad thing to cut the EPA? Or the importance of limiting corruption because a lot of our financial reputation is staked on being a low-corruption country with strong property rights? Does anyone actually fucking understand how this country works?

patriot,liberal,Worry about schools using right wing curriculum,"I recently wrote a strongly worded email to my child’s principal and district superintendent, and honestly anyone else that looked mildly important on the district website, about the “Indoctrination of K-12 schools” executive order and how worried I was for the changes in curriculum that it implies. 

I got an accidental reply, someone in the district forwarded it to someone else and said it was a “form letter” but they should reply to me anyways. It actually isn’t a form letter but it got me thinking…maybe it could be! So here it is in case anyone else wants to edit it, send it to whoever will be most bothered. 


To whom it may concern,

My name is ______ and I am a concerned parent within the _______ School District. I am deeply disturbed over the current president’s executive order for “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling”.

This executive order is in itself an appalling and overzealous attempt to indoctrinate my child and the children of our community into believing a singular and all together false account of our national history.

I am writing to you today to specifically talk about Section 3 B. 

“(viii)  “the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory.

And the following Section D:
“Patriotic education” means a presentation of the history of America grounded in: 
(i)    an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles; 
(ii)   a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history; 
(iii)  the concept that commitment to America’s aspirations is beneficial and justified; and
(iv)   the concept that celebration of America’s greatness and history is proper.”

I have the utmost trust in our college-educated, professionally trained and licensed teachers to display a developmentally appropriate yet accurate reflection of history throughout all grade levels. However, I am concerned for the ways that our school’s curriculum may be forced to change, either within this school year or the years following, to accommodate the aforementioned demands.

The federal government is trying to enforce by a law a subjective manner of tone. What exactly constitutes “accurate and ennobling” when considering the ways various marginalized citizens have fought to earn human rights in America?

Subverting the racial and sexist reality of our nation’s history erases our community members’ struggles, laying the groundwork for future discrimination, and creating an environment where the subjective tone of factual events can be punishable by law and funding. 

I ask that you are transparent if and when ______ School and all schools within __________ School District are altering any policies or curriculum to accommodate the aforementioned and all additional sections of this executive order.

And I demand, as a community member and parent, that you DON’T allow the extreme overreach of federal government into our children’s education and livelihood.

patriot,liberal,A horrifying reality of Trump's 2nd term. NO ONE is safe from p2025. Am I the only one seeing this?,"Can we start to assume that no one this time in the white house will ever be liable for anything anymore so long as their lips are aligned with Trump's asshole and suck whatever comes out?

No one on his Legion of Doom will ever have consequences for their actions until they devour themselves for power over whatever is left standing when they are done using anyone that goes against them for slave labor.

I've been calling this game MAGAtes and p2025 have laid out for years.. but I need to run it by other liberals that can be objective and tell me I'm not right. I hope I'm not.

If you can follow this logic and have any decent memory of events in the past 3 Republican terms, you might feel like this is an actually real scenario... If I'm way off on something please call me out. I'm not saying this will be exact, but that the end result will be the same regardless of the how's and when's.

We won't have mass deportation like he's saying but there will be laws that ramp up justice arm's power to get rid of and imprison people here slowly over time .. which eventually through p2025 can fall on ANYONE they decide they wish to detain or get rid of.. even US born citizens. They will have the power to decide unilaterally and disregard civil rights and due process.

It will start with the undocumented immigrants they locate.. then find people who are expendable or have criminal records, people with addictions or that have had govt assistance, down to people that just aren't ""American"" enough, dangers or non-patriots.. they will be rounded up to be ""reformed."" They'll use camps for these people and work their way down the list until you have his side, and those suffering doing Chinese/gulag/gestapo-style govt labor to achieve forever power and control over us. You can change the terms and methods but let's assume they can do what they want, because they have everything they need now to do so.

Think it's crazy? Conspiracy? Yeah I get it but sometimes we see things before they happen and never listen to the ones who warned us. But it's all in the 2025 playbook and we've been here before. This time only the people can stop it, but that won't happen when we're scared and shut in our homes asking for help, saying yeah but not MY family right?

All they need to do is what I've been saying for years, declare another seemingly needed, but ultimately bullshit ""war.."" 

I think this time it will be the ""war on immigration"" or something so they can make up emergency war time acts/laws.. just like the war on terror. Which was how we got the patriot act..  remember that? Civil liberties trampled on, privacy violated. We were scared, so they were allowed to quell our fears, but what they were really doing was not targeted at terror and our enemies, but at Americans themselves. 

People are scared again, and just like COVID you get rich by causing a problem and selling the solution. This time I truly feel like they're going to take everything from us.. and what I fear more is that they know we can't sustain our population anymore, and they intend to close ranks, save themselves, and watch the rest of us slowly fade into genocidal memory.

Please take a few minutes to read and absorb just what this woman had to say, and then hopefully everyone will pass it to their entire mailing list, and theirs to theirs until it circles the nation!  Time is short and arrogance, stupidity and ignorance abound...


 

The following letter is rapidly circulating around the country. Americans everywhere identify with this 53-year-old woman. She has given us a voice. Once you read this, you will want to forward it to all of your friends...


 




""I am a home grown American citizen, 53, registered Democrat all my life. Before the last presidential election I registered as a Republican because I no longer felt the Democratic Party represents my views or works to pursue issues important to me. Now I no longer feel the Republican Party represents my views or works to pursue issues important to me. The fact is I no longer feel any political party or representative in Washington represents my views or works to pursue the issues important to me.   Instead, we are burdened with Congressional Dukes and Duchesses who think they know better than the citizens they are supposed to represent.

There must be someone. Please tell me who you are. Please stand up and tell me that you are there and that you're willing to fight for our Constitution as it was written. Please stand up now. 
You might ask yourself what my views and issues are that I would feel so horribly disenfranchised by both major political parties. What kind of nut-job am I? Well, these briefly are the views and issues for which I seek   representation: 

One, illegal immigration.. I want you to stop coddling illegal immigrants and secure our borders. Close the underground tunnels.. Stop the violence and the trafficking in drugs and people. No amnesty, not again. Been there, done that, no resolution.  

 P.S., I'm not a racist. This is not to be confused with legal immigration.


Two, the STIMULUS bill. I want it repealed and I want no further funding supplied to it. We told you No, but you did it anyway. I want the remaining unfunded 95% repealed. Freeze, repeal.


Three: Czars. I want the circumvention of our constitutional checks and balances stopped immediately. Fire the czars. No more czars. Government officials answer to the process, not to the president. Stop trampling on our Constitution, and honor it.


Four, cap and trade. The debate on global warming is not over. There are many conflicting opinions and it is too soon for this radical legislation. Quit throwing our nation into politically-correct quicksand.


Five, universal healthcare. I will not be rushed into another expensive decision that will burden me, my children, and grandchildren. Don't you dare try to pass this in the middle of the night without even reading it. Slow down!  Fix only what is broken -- we have the best health care system in the world -- and test any new program in one or two states first.


Six, growing government control. I want states rights and sovereignty   fully restored. I want less government in my life, not more. More is not better! Shrink it down. Mind your own business.  You have enough to take care of with your real [Constitutional] obligations. Why don't you start there.


Seven, ACORN. I do not want ACORN and its affiliates in charge of our 2010 census.. I want them investigated. I also do not want mandatory escrow fees contributed to them every time on every real estate deal that closes -- how did they pull that one off?  Stop the funding to ACORN and its affiliates pending impartial audits and investigations. I do not trust them with taking the census with our taxpayer money. I don't trust them with any of our taxpayer money. Face up to the allegations against them and get it resolved before taxpayers get any more involved with them. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, hello. Stop protecting your political buddies. You work for us, the people. Investigate.


Eight, redistribution of wealth. No, no, no. I work for my money. It is mine. I have always worked for people with more money than I have because they gave me jobs -- and that is the only redistribution of wealth that I will support. I never got a job from a poor person! Why do you want me to hate my employers? And what do you have against shareholders making a profit?


Nine, charitable contributions. Although I never got a job from a poor person, I have helped many in need. Charity belongs in our local communities, where we know our needs best and can use our local talent and our local resources. Butt out, please. We want to do it ourselves.


Ten, corporate bailouts. Knock it off. Every company must sink or swim like the rest of us. If there are hard times ahead, we'll be better off just getting into it and letting the strong survive. Quick and painful. (Have you ever ripped off a Band-Aid?) We will pull together. Great things happen in America under great hardship. Give us the chance to innovate. We cannot disappoint you more than you have disappointed us.


Eleven, transparency and accountability. How about it? No, really, how about it? Let's have it. Let's say we give the buzzwords a rest and have some straight honest talk.. Please stop trying to manipulate and appease me with clever wording.. I am not the idiot you obviously take me for. Stop sneaking around and meeting in back rooms making deals with your friends. It will only be a prelude to your criminal investigation. Stop hiding things from me.


Twelve, unprecedented quick spending. Stop it now.
Take a breath. Listen to the people. Slow down and get some input from nonpoliticians and experts on the subject. Stop making everything an emergency. Stop speed-reading our bills into law. I am not an activist.. I am not a community organizer. Nor am I a terrorist, a militant or a violent person. I am a parent and a grandparent.. I work. I'm busy.  I am busy, and I am tired. I thought we elected competent people to take care of the business of government so that we could work, raise our families, pay our bills, have a little recreation, complain about taxes, endure our hardships, pursue our personal goals, cut our lawn, wash our cars on the weekends and be responsible contributing members of society and teach our children to be the same all while living in the home of the free and land of the brave.


I entrusted you with upholding the Constitution. I believed in the checks and balances to keep from getting far off course. What happened? You are very far off course. Do you really think I find humor in the hiring of a speed reader to unintelligently ramble all through a bill that you signed into law without knowing what it contained? I do not. 
It is a mockery of the responsibility I have entrusted to you. It is a slap in the face. I am not laughing at your arrogance. Why is it that I feel as if you would not trust me to make a single decision about my own life and how I would live it but you should expect that I should trust you with the debt that you have laid on all of us and our children. We did not want the TARP bill. We said no. We would repeal it if we could. I am sure that we still cannot. There is needless urgency and recklessness in all of your recent spending of our tax dollars.


From my perspective, it seems that all of you have gone insane. I also know that I am far from alone in these feelings. Do you honestly feel that your current pursuits have merit to patriotic Americans? We want it to stop. We want to put the brakes on everything that is being rushed by us and forced upon us. We want our voice back. You have forced us to put our lives on hold to straighten out the mess that you are making. We will have to give up our vacations, our time spent with our children, any relaxation time we may have had and money we cannot afford to spend on bringing our concerns to Washington . Our president often knows all the right buzzwords like unsustainable. Well, no kidding. How many tens of thousands of dollars did the focus group cost to come up with that word? We don't want your overpriced words. Stop treating us like we're morons.


We want all of you to stop focusing on your reelection and do the job we want done, not the job you want done or the job your party wants done. You work for us and at this rate I guarantee you not for long because we are coming. We will be heard and we will be represented.. You think we're so busy with our lives that we will never come for you? We are the formerly silent majority, all of us who quietly work, pay taxes, obey the law, vote, save money, keep our noses to the grindstone... and we are now looking at you. 


You have awakened us, the patriotic freedom spirit so strong and so powerful that it had been sleeping too long. You have pushed us too far. Our numbers are great. They may surprise you. For every one of us who will be there, there will be hundreds more that could not come. Unlike you, we have their trust. We will represent them honestly, rest assured. They will be at the polls on voting day to usher you out of office. 

We have cancelled vacations. We will use our last few dollars saved. We will find the representation among us and a grassroots campaign will flourish. We didn't ask for this fight. But the gloves are coming off. We do not come in violence, but we are angry. You will represent us or you will be replaced with someone who will. There are candidates among us who will rise like a Phoenix from the ashes that you have made of our constitution.

elites,liberal,What do you think? Afghanistan in 70s vs US today?,"The transformation of Afghanistan in the 1970s into a conservative religious state and recent cultural shifts in the United States share some parallels in terms of societal responses to modernization, polarization, and the role of religion.

Similarities:

1. Backlash Against Modernization:

   - In Afghanistan, rapid modernization efforts in the 20th century—such as women's education and secular reforms—provoked strong resistance from conservative rural populations, leading to a reversal toward religious conservatism.

   - In the U.S., cultural debates over progressive policies (e.g., gender rights, education reforms) have fueled polarization, with some groups advocating for a return to traditional or religious values.


2. Urban-Rural Divide:

   - Afghanistan experienced a widening gap between urban elites embracing modernization and rural communities adhering to traditional Islamic norms[2].

   - Similarly, the U.S. has seen divisions between urban areas leaning progressive and rural regions favoring conservative ideologies.


3. Rise of Religious Conservatism:

   - In Afghanistan, political instability and external interventions enabled the rise of Islamist movements like the Taliban, which imposed strict religious laws.

   - In the U.S., there has been a resurgence of Christian nationalist rhetoric among certain political factions, emphasizing religion's role in governance.


4. Polarization and Reactionary Movements:

   - In both contexts, societal polarization has led to reactionary movements opposing perceived threats to cultural or religious identity, whether through Islamization in Afghanistan or conservative pushes in the U.S.


While the specifics differ—Afghanistan's changes were shaped by war and foreign intervention—the underlying dynamics of resistance to rapid change and cultural divides are comparable.",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ijzf9h/what_do_you_think_afghanistan_in_70s_vs_us_today/,1738946754.0,1ijzf9h
elites,liberal,The Conservatives are using the L.A. fires to begin the attempt to make a Republican Governor of California. (Rant),"Gavin Newsom will be termed out in 2026. The Conservatives kept mentioning him as a possible replacement for Joe Biden in the 2024 election. I suspect they are expecting him to run in 2028 and are already gearing up a smear campaign to knock him out of the primaries. 

Right now they are blaming the fires on Democrat leadership. My guess is that the Conservatives, who now basically run the GOP will find a conservative candidate to run for Governor in 2026. This candidate will no doubt be endorsed by Trump. 

Once Trump officially takes office, I expect Comer and Jordan to launch the first investigation of the year against Newsom and the Mayor of L.A (a Black female Democrat). It will be a show trial that doesn’t solve anything. The main purpose is to make the people of California think the Democrats are idiots. If it works is a different story. 

What I find funny is how hypocritical the conservatives are. During the election they hated the “Hollywood elites”. Now they sympathize with them for losing the their million dollar homes. Building reservoirs and new fire hydrants will be the “low egg and gas prices” of the 2026 California election.

elites,liberal,"Group Read—""The Death of the Liberal Class,"" by Chris Hedges","Hi all,

/r/NonFictionBookClub just picked our next book, [*The Death of the Liberal Class*](http://www.amazon.com/Death-Liberal-Class-Chris-Hedges/dp/1568586795), and I thought some of you folks might be interested in joining us to read it. The book argues that Liberal institutions have failed to protect Liberal values, and have essentially sold out the American public to other interests.

Hedges is pretty (in fact intensely) Liberal, so you'll probably agree with him in a lot of places, but he makes some controversial points that are definitely worth considering. And anyways, Hedges is an entertaining and generally pretty intelligent author; a fun read if you agree with him, and no less enjoyable if you disagree.

Blurb from Amazon:

> *The Death of the Liberal Class* examines the failure of the liberal class to confront the rise of the corporate state and the consequences of a liberalism that has become profoundly bankrupted. Hedges argues there are five pillars of the liberal establishment — the press, liberal religious institutions, labor unions, universities and the Democratic Party — and that each of these institutions, more concerned with status and privilege than justice and progress, sold out the constituents they represented. In doing so, the liberal class has become irrelevant to society at large and ultimately the corporate power elite they once served.

Our first discussion will be of chapter 1, on Monday the 21st, and we'd love to have you join us. If you have trouble getting the book, I'll be uploading a pdf of the first few chapters (at least) in the next few days.

Thanks /u/davidreiss666 for letting me post here.

brainwashed,liberal,When some people wake up and realize they made a mistake either voting for Trump or not voting at all my sympathy will be gone.,"Make no mistake. I'm sure over the course of the next four years we'll get posts from people who lament their choices this election. I won't have any sympathy. In fact, I'll gladly give them the middle finger. 

The writing has been on the walls for months... years even. Harris, to anyone with common sense, was the better candidate. Regardless of the culture war nonsense she was young, had more experience, and smarter than Trump or Biden. She garnered MILLIONS MORE votes than Hillary did against Trump and STILL lost. It's insane.

So when people inevitably regret their decisions I'm not going to hold back the punches. All the warnings were handed to them on a silver platter and they ignored them. They were brainwashed by Fox News and other alt-right influencers like Joe Rogan. And while them regretting their decision might be considered a good thing, it won't change my response. The damage has been done... will be done... and part of that blame lies on them.",274,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1hoheq6/when_some_people_wake_up_and_realize_they_made_a/,1735425838.0,1hoheq6
agenda,liberal,The nationally televised address I want to hear from President Biden right now,"My fellow Americans, this week the Supreme Court declared that the President of the United States is completely immune to prosecution for any crime he commits in his official capacity.  The majority held that the President’s communications, intentions, and even his own confessions cannot be considered to hold him accountable for his crimes committed in the course of almost anything related to his official acts.  

This ruling is wrong, unprecedented, and offensive to our democracy.  It has been universally condemned by legal experts from across the political spectrum.  Absolutely nothing in our Constitution or laws says anything which remotely resembles the legal immunity which this Court has announced, and all available evidence suggests that its exclusion from our Constitution was intentional.  Founding Father Alexander Hamilton wrote that unlike a king, a president under our Constitution could be impeached and, quote, “would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment,” unquote.  Former President Nixon conceded his potential criminal liability by accepting a pardon for his illegal conduct in office in 1974.  As recently as 2021, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Donald Trump was not immune to the civil and criminal consequences of his actions leading up to the January 6 insurrection against Congress. 

We are a nation of laws and equality, not a monarchy in which our leaders are above the law.  We elect stewards of our government, not all-powerful dictators.  Our presidents are not only bound to the same law as everyone else, but especially responsible to execute their duties in strict and solemn conformance with the lawfully-enacted statutes which govern the awesome powers entrusted to them by the American people.  I, like my predecessors, am a sworn protector of the law, and can never be authorized to abuse it without consequence.  I have already pledged never to take advantage of the outrageous opinion of the Supreme Court’s majority.  I renew that pledge today, and ask every individual who seeks this office in the future to pledge the same. 

Know that this ruling cannot and will not stand. Today I announce that I, the Democratic Party, and Republicans who value our first-world democracy will work together to ensure that the Office of the President of the United States, regardless of its occupant, forever remains bound by the law of the land.  Every available option — from a constitutional amendment, federal legislation, to restructuring of our Supreme Court and its ethical obligations — is on the table.  We will restore our revered tradition of legal equality.  Tyrants, despots, and compromised jurists will not undermine our 248-year old nation of democratic governance — we, as freedom-loving Americans, simply will not permit it.  Presidents change, and their agendas differ, but their obligation to obey the law must remain constant.  I ask every American, regardless of their political leanings, to join me in this critical endeavor for the sanctity and security of our great nation.  Thank you and good night.

agenda,liberal,"Even after reading the horror story coming from the C.B.O.report,Trump and the Republicans are still going to ram us with this horrible Trumpcare through some budget maneuvers that requires only 50 Senate votes. Go figure !","Yes, it seems like the Republicans are totally determined to push through their agenda of making the older Americans suffer with higher premiums at the expense of lower premiums for the younger generation.

Actually I've no problem with the younger people paying less premium than older people as it's a common fact that the older people fall more sick than the younger people.

But to raise the older Americans' premiums sky high when they're on a fixed income of either social security payments or pension or both, is one hell of a devilish act. 

Yes, Devil has to be acting through Trump and these congressional Republicans' mind, otherwise who could think of a time in America when our older generation along with our Medicaid recipients will be totally annihilated from no insurance to cover their doctors and hospital visits.

But what puzzles most about Trump and Republicans is that they already forgot that there was a time when White older Americans used to be main driver behind their control of Congress.

But now with this new and totally disastrous Republican healthcare plan or Trumpcare as it'll be called, it seems like that demographic block of older White Americans and older Black and older minority Americans will be thrown 'under the bus' by this totally moronic Republican members of congress led by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. 

Yes, it was totally unthinkable a few years back under Obamacare that the younger Americans will be paying much less premiums than older people.

But now under this new plan, the older Americans will pay at the rate of 20 to 30 percent higher premium than a 20 year old.

Actually those younger Americans' premiums will go down by 20 to 25 percent under Trumpcare.

And it'll be 8 percent to 10 percent lower for a 40 year old.

Although I do not want anybody's premium go higher but to expect the older Americans to pony up $14,600 higher under the Republican plan is akin to asking the older people to die early.

And the same goes for the Americans who are under Medicaid .

If the Republicans really go through this 'horse and pony show' and cut Medicaid for 24 million people who're getting a lifeline under Obamacare and tell them abruptly that they're no longer eligible for any benefits, then the Republicans in the Congress can be sure that all hell will break loose in this country of 350 million people where at least 75 million people are Medicaid recipients.

''Yes, Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell, be rest assured that our country's poor citizens will revolt .

Neither Trump nor your Republican members of Congress can do anything about that.

And by the way before I forget to add to my blog, a little less than half of those Medicaid recipients are Republicans.

And they always voted for the Republican candidates in all the elections.

So go ahead with your stupid healthcare plan and see if you hold the majorities in both the Chambers of Congress.

Your defeats next year in the congressional elections will be as swift as your wins were so far.''",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/5zf899/even_after_reading_the_horror_story_coming_from/,1489528449.0,5zf899
agenda,liberal,Am I turning into an old fart? losing faith in liberalism.,"I used to consider myself liberal, but have been having a really hard time with it recently, and have almost abandoned it completely due to the massive influx of opinions and movements that are seeming increasing retarded and dangerous... I'm not trying to provoke anything here, but is anyone else losing faith in liberals? some of my main concerns are young liberals ""safe place"" style culture of everyone living in a hugbox and never having their opinions challenged, or feelings hurt.

The assumption that no harm will come from tens of thousands of refugees from the war torn middle entering Europe and the west. The increasingly violent lashing out at people with other political views. I have never considered myself conservative, but cant in all honestly call myself a liberal anymore.

It also seems like the parties are way too divided, did politicians not used to share both liberal and conservative ideas?

freedom,liberal,A Call to Rethink Gun Control in the Age of Authoritarianism,"

This is an essay I've been working on for a bit. Feel free to ignore if you don't like mucho texto, tl;dr at the bottom. 

As the United States confronts the renewed and intensifying authoritarianism of the Trump administration in 2025 with its swelling number of executive orders, deepening disregard for civil liberties, and growing cult of personality, it is time for liberals, Democrats, and left-leaning citizens to seriously reconsider their long-held stances on gun control.

This is not a call to violence. This is a call to awareness, to responsibility, and to freedom. In an era where institutions are being hollowed out, where the judiciary is being stacked to enable the erosion of constitutional rights, and where federal power is consolidating in deeply troubling ways, it is a grave mistake for the political left to continue championing policies that disarm the very people most likely to resist tyranny.

Historically, the roots of many American gun control measures lie not in public safety, but in fear and racism. The 1967 Mulford Act in California, which banned open carry, was a direct response to the Black Panthers lawfully bearing arms in protest. Ronald Reagan, then governor, supported the bill precisely because it disarmed black radicals. This pattern where laws are crafted and enforced in ways that disproportionately disarm and criminalize Black, Brown, and working-class Americans has continued to this day.

Today, the same liberal institutions that once defended civil rights have become complacent in the overregulation of firearms, too often embracing a classist and condescending rhetoric that alienates millions of working-class Americans, especially in rural and Southern communities. Mocking gun owners, belittling their concerns, or labeling them with crude stereotypes not only undermines solidarity, it actively pushes potential allies into the arms of reactionary movements.

Worse yet, the recent semi-automatic weapons ban in Colorado and the proposed Glock ban in California are not only tone-deaf in the midst of rising authoritarianism, they’re destructive. These measures confirm the worst suspicions of gun owners: that they are being politically and culturally targeted, not for public safety, but for ideological control. Such legislation doesn’t make communities safer, it only further polarizes the electorate and entrenches gun owners deeper into the right, driving them away from any shared civic cause with progressives.

Meanwhile, it is the marginalized: immigrants, the poor, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals among others who are left defenseless in an increasingly hostile political landscape. Police budgets swell while community protections shrink. Civil society is not safer with fewer guns, it is simply more vulnerable to the unchecked force of the state.

If those on the left are serious about resisting creeping authoritarianism, they must be serious about empowering the people, all the people. That includes respecting the right to self-defense, the right to organize, and yes, the right to bear arms as enshrined in the Second Amendment. One cannot claim to defend democracy while advocating for the state to monopolize violence.

And to those who identify as liberal or progressive: if there is any hope of forging common ground in this fractured country, gun owners must be treated as citizens with legitimate concerns, not ridiculed, belittled, or dismissed with smug insults. Their fears of government overreach are no longer fringe, they are grounded in the daily reality of American politics. Recognizing that is not surrendering progressive values, it’s understanding the urgency of the moment.

Let this be the moment the left shifts. Let this be the generation that reclaims the Second Amendment, not as a symbol of fear, but as a tool of democratic empowerment. Let it be used to build a society where civil rights and community safety are not mutually exclusive. Where the right to speak, assemble, and defend ourselves are respected equally.

Because if we truly believe in freedom, in democracy, and in justice then we cannot afford to keep fighting the wrong battles.


TL;DR:
In the face of growing authoritarianism under Trump, the left must reconsider gun control. Many restrictions have racist origins and hurt marginalized communities. Recent bans alienate gun owners and push them rightward. To resist state overreach, progressives should respect the Second Amendment and stop vilifying gun owners, it's a matter of empowerment as much as it is pragmatism.

freedom,liberal,Another Rant - STOP EXTERNALIZING BLAME,"After the 2016 election I was, like most liberals, at a complete loss as to what happened and felt like I lacked any understanding of the American electorate. I was incredibly disappointed in my fellow Americans. I still am. But we’ve had *eight years* to figure them out how to persuade them to vote this infantile sociopath out of public life. We failed miserably at doing the *things that are under control* to win. I’m so sick of hearing about the things that are *not* under our control, like inflation, the economy, the right wing media, and the intelligence/ignorance/gullibility of the electorate. For the love of god can we focus on  **addressing the concerns of the American electorate* as they are, not as we want them to be, instead of constantly trying to deflect or explain them away. Even worse is chastising people for having concerns. There are always going to be external factors that influence elections. Tough sh*t. 

The American electorate is **economically populist and socially moderate**. For the social progressives here, you don’t have to like it but you do have to accept reality. We need a **simple and positive message that matches the will of the American electorate**. 

Examples:

1. Immigration. 

“We love legal immigration. It’s been the backbone of our country forever. We want a fair system where people can legally emigrate. However we will not tolerate lawlessness and will strictly enforce our borders. I wish we would have addressed this earlier but we are serious now. And by the way, we have a great bill that Republicans failed to pass.” 

2. Inflation. 

Yes: “I know the American people are hurting. The problem is wages have not kept up with inflation. [insert populist message]

No: “It’s not a big deal, it’s slowed down to normal now!”  

3. Social issues. 

Yes: “Yeah, some of us got a little out of hand during the pandemic era, but the Democratic Party categorically rejects the lawlessness of the defund the police movement and rejects government overreach in imposing social values on others. We reject identity politics and are here for everyone!”

No: “Uhh, next question.” 

4. Media/social media. 

Yes: “We categorically reject government censorship of social media, outside of state secrets and other serious stuff like that. We are not your big brother. We believe in freedom. Yes I’ll absolutely go on Joe Rogan and even light up a joint!” 

No: “another GOP talking point - I can’t believe you idiots are falling for it! Rogan!? Sounds risky!”.

5. Freedom. 

“We are the party of freedom! Let’s legalize weed! Also online gambling! We will protect your porn! And obviously, a woman’s right to choose! The GOP will do none of this. *They* want to be your big brother, not us.” 

6. Trump. 

Yes: “He doesn’t give a shi*t about you. He cares about golfing and doesn’t even like to read.” 

No: “He’s a fascist/racist!” 

The bottom line is we have to address issues as they are brought up - *even if they are brought up in bad faith* by the GOP. Deflecting and pointing out they are being brought up to manipulate and don’t really matter to many people’s lives - *even if true* - is an absolutely awful strategy that has played a large role in leading to this disaster. We are not being manipulated into *responding* to culture war and other issues, we are being manipulated into *not responding* and taking an actual stance on these issues because the GOP knows it looks bad when we do it. It’s not that hard folks: if something seems to matter to people, address it head on with an economically populist and socially moderate standpoint. Do not deflect and externalize blame. End rant.

freedom,liberal,Pamphlet on the Corruption and Absurdity of American Institutions of Higher Learning,"Pamphlet on the Corruption and Absurdity of American Institutions of Higher Learning  
  
I am sorry for the long post I prepared, but it is the most important post to society I need to offer.   
  
This post is to reveal the petty crimes and corruption committed by institutions providing higher learning (Colleges, Universities). This corruption is in plain view, yet people trust on the credibility of these institutions and ignore the problems. A little backstory on the author will help give a few details. I am a college student taking courses at Edmonds College, in Washington State. The courses will allow me in finishing the requirements for an associate degree in science, for computer science. As most of my discussion will be familiar to Edmonds College, yet Edmonds College is only one important part in a system called American education. It only takes one brick to bring down a house, so will it take one college to discredit each institution of higher learning. Today I will prove the institutions of higher learning uncredible and that there is, in fact, something strange and secret going on behind the walls of our local college or university. Most of this has to do with money, hence, why corruption exists.    
  
The first point and the main point I would begin discussing is the evidential purpose that institutions of higher learning are in fact shaving as much money off you as they can before you graduate. Let me explain, if you would click on this link https://www.edmonds.edu/programs-and-degrees/areas-of-study/ you will be redirected to the various studies and degrees offered by Edmonds college (the institution I am attending). If you scan through as many programs as you would like, you will notice the trend of similar classes offered by every degree no matter that they are completely opposite areas of study. Lets look at a few degrees here: Culinary Arts – Associate of Technical Arts Degree: https://catalog.edmonds.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=61&poid=14803 , Associate in Arts – Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA): https://catalog.edmonds.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=61&poid=14646 , Associate in Science-T – Track 2 – Physics, Computer Science, Engineering, Atmospheric Sciences: https://catalog.edmonds.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=61&poid=14782 . Two important points strike the eyeball and that is the General Education Requirements for every degree. Looking at almost any degree will yield the same point and that is that your degree requires you to take General Education Requirements. General Education requirements are self-explanatory and that they are classes like English, Science, or mathematics, just like the classes that could be taken at high school, except this time you must pay for these classes. Many points can be brought about questioning the requirement of taking these classes. First of all, in order for me to receive my associate’s diploma, I will have to take these classes despite them clearly not having any use for my study. Why do I need to take an English class requirement for my Science degree in Computer Science that has nothing to do with using Java code? Why do I need to take a business mathematics class for my Culinary Arts degree when most chefs are employed by managers and not for themselves? Why do I even need any math class for my associate in art? This also shows that these degrees are all similar and therefore could just be one degree that everyone strives for. How about we make every college student follow the same path to a diploma like they do in high school. There would be no need of choosing or even understanding that there are different degrees for different studies because clearly, all the degrees listed have a majority of the same classes. Crystal clear is the point that these General Education requirements are just useless classes required you to be taken and paid for from your own pocket. Have I not taken English, Mathematics, History, and Art classes at my public/private/home school annually for twelve years, yet after graduating I am required to take these classes again and this time pay for them out of my own pocket? Could this be a way that colleges exploit and have exploited simple students like us so that they can benefit? Do we really want that to keep happening to us?   
  
Another point, although quite small, are the Cultural Diversity Skills required by my college although other colleges and universities will require you to take such classes as Critical Race Theory (while also requiring yourself to pay for them). If you look at the first set of classes in the previous paragraph, you could see that all of them require you to take a Cultural Diversity Skills class. Although I could have used the same classes, I will list a different set to diversify this work. Take a look at a different set of classes: Associate in Biology – Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA/MRP): https://catalog.edmonds.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=61&poid=14701, Culinary Arts - Baking Associate of Technical Arts Degree: https://catalog.edmonds.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=61&poid=14806, Horticulture – Landscape Design Specialization Associate of Technical Arts Degree: https://catalog.edmonds.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=61&poid=14789. All these degrees have a Cultural Diversity Skills requirement. I would assume Cultural Diversity Skills is what it is and that it is a requirement for you to be taught the diversity of the world. This is the same problem faced in the previous paragraph and that these skills were learned and developed at a public/private/home grade school that we went to for 12 years at no cost. Since first grade we were exposed to friends/classmates of varying cultures and ethnic groups. At no circumstance have we been taught by our teachers to hate these cultures or ethnic groups. In fact, some public schools even began teaching us to embrace these cultures. In middle school we began learning history of America and of other countries that we not yet knew of. Just recently graduating high school showed me that (at least at my school), we needed to take classes that fulfilled our World History, United States History, and another History elective credits. World history would literally teach us the history of different countries, cultures, and ethnic groups that existed on the continents of Asia, South America, North America, Europe, Africa, and Oceania. United States history would teach us the History of the United States and that, yes, slavery and racism played a major role in our country and that now we know to do something about it. Even other classes like political science which would fulfill our History elective credit would teach us the cultural, ethnic, and racial factors at play in Americas political system. All these classes taught us cultural diversity in grade school for free. Why then do I have to take another diversity class in college required for my degree, and pay a minimum of $50 just to understand that I should not be racist? Sure some classes do need a Cultural Diversity Skills requirement like Diversity Studies https://www.edmonds.edu/programs-and-degrees/areas-of-study/social-sciences-and-cultural-studies/diversity-studies/ (I kid you not, my college literally links Diversity Studies to the same degree: Associate in Arts (Transfer Degree). Is not that lazy?). I understand that other classes will need a Cultural Diversity Class, but I am not studying for Diversity Studies, I am studying in Computer Science: https://catalog.edmonds.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=61&poid=14782 .   
  
Thirdly, there is another absurd class requirement and that it is sweetly named “Career and College Success”. This might just be the class required at my school only, but it needs to be discussed. I will speak frankly and without formation. Basically, from what I have heard this class will teach you things like notetaking and efficient scheduling that are apparently for “career and college success https://catalog.edmonds.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=61&poid=14782 (stated under the Career and College Success heading).” What if I already know how to note-take and efficiently spend my day, am I still required to relearn these skills? Did I not have good or even better grades in middle and high school when I was still developing these skills? Am I required to be taught how to be an efficient employee or student for my employers or teachers? Clearly this class has nothing to do for our studies whatsoever. Personally, I have yet to take this requirement, but I can already tell this is a scam. I am really required to enroll in and pay for this class that is just a self-help class except with stress, work, and a possibility of a failing grade.   
  
What if I am wrong in my opinion and that all these classes are truly needed for my degree and that I am not understanding the full picture of why institutions require students to learn these things. If you have insights into why institutions require these classes, then post a reply and we could all learn. Meanwhile, I only have two reasons as to why there is a requirement for these classes (and not for a waste of your money) and that is that all of us come from varying backgrounds of education and that we need to be on the same page when taking any class in the institution. Another reason is that I am just a stupid rebellious student who does not understand the inner workings of my college because I am not a professor, administrator, manager or even my job employer to understand why these classes are useful. I am not aware of what you might think, but my mind quickly destroys the plausibility of these claims as both are as unstable as a chair with one leg. Firstly, if we come from different backgrounds of education like, some came from, home school, others from private, and yet many from public school, then you are telling these people that you do not trust if they have been taught correctly or even taught at all? You are telling me that the same public school I attended that is in the same literal state county as the College, did not teach me correctly? You are telling me personally although indirectly, that after going to a public school (everyone can trust government education?) for twelve years, that I have not been taught correctly by the government the same government that funds your college? Furthermore, one can ask “well what about students who arrived abroad and have never studied at an American school” or how about “private or home schoolers” and to that I say this: If these degree requirements are so well tailored to students who come to study from abroad or from a different program, then how about you stop putting public American citizens in the same suit that doesn’t fit them at all. How about colleges and universities tailor their degrees for their students instead of tailoring their students to the programs that they offer. The last counterclaim is the idea that I do not know what I am talking about as I do not have the credentials to understand, and upon that claim, I spit. The same can be said by the president of America that we, the people are dumb and know nothing about American politics and that we should just give the president all the power because he is clearly the president. Or that we should allow our children to be taught anything and everything that we don’t like at the schools we pay (either by taxes or actual subscriptions) because we are just the parents and not the teachers. Or how about we allow the managers to increase our work hours and decrease our pay because the managers know better than we do and after all, we are not the managers. Anyone and maybe even an imbecile will understand that something is out of place or wrong just because everyone has the ability to reason, and we are all equal on that. It is reasonable to me that I should never give my money to scams like these. We need to tell the institutions of higher learning that we will only pay for the classes truly needed for our degree and that which make sense.   
  
My associate in science (computer science) degree has only 30% or less classes that are actually useful compared to a majority of General Education and other requirements. If I work as a McDonalds cashier, earning less than $40,000 dollars a year ($15 every hour for eight hours a day every Monday to Friday at nine o’clock to five). And I pay close to half (sometimes even all) of my salary to education and the other half to bills, food, taxes, for four-years before I can become a computer programmer, then why is it I am paying such a great and useless burden for the betterment of my own life if it could just be lighter? (Although after finally having a skilled job, you will still need to repay student loans.) Instead, I could be paying less than a third of my salary to higher education and even learning faster to finally not have to spend dreading my life at a minimum wage job for four years.   
  
Another and last problem or question we need to ask is whether government funding to these colleges/universities/schools is being used correctly. This is the last and wider point about American institutions of higher learning and has nothing to do with my college. Since I recently learned of this and am in fact talking about the Absurdity of American institutions, I would need to bring this topic to the surface. This point might not have much evidence or even strong evidence although I am just trying to discuss the plausibility of it and not merrily defending it. This point states: government funding is going to the institutions of higher education, but is it worth it (government funding is our tax money)? Here is a certain website I looked at https://www.collegevaluesonline.com/colleges-benefiting-from-government-spending/ and it shows the amount of government spending on institutions of higher learning. I am not sure but am certain that the further you go down the list the more prestigious and the more government funded the institutions get. The 30th place, Dine college from Tsaile, Arizona. Honestly I have never heard of this college, but could assume it might be revered in its area. Looking in the top twenty colleges will show Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts at number 11th place. Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts at number 10th place. Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut at number 9th place. Stanford University in Stanford, California at number 6th place. Columbia University in New York City, New York at number 4th place. Finally, albeit ironically, University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, at the number 1st place. The pattern you can notice is that the first five Institutions I have listed, MIT, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Columbia are all private ivy league schools. University of Washington is a public research university that received $1.45 Billion in federal funding in 2021 according to the website. From there you could guess how much the other private institutions would be getting when they are not supposed to. Of course, some of this federal funding could come from student scholarships, endowments, and research funds from the government. Although I think everyone has heard that these institutions are quite expensive, so I have no idea as to why the schools still need more funding. University of Washington is the only school who rightfully deserves direct government funding, but some questions could be raised about that. Again, this idea does not have much evidence to it as I do not want to discuss this idea for too long and that it is not as important, but that it still needs some thought.   
  
This whole post proved the misuse and waste of your money “for the obtainment of higher education”. I could have added more topics like how most degrees also need you to take electives which is the same aspect you could do in High School except also for free. Or the idea that some classes can be grouped together into one class like Calculus I, II, III (and then it goes stupidly on from there) so that lesser classes and therefore lesser money being taken and paid for. Or I could have talked more about general topics like Ivy league schools being just higher learning clubs for the rich, or how Ivy leagues (or the prestigious colleges) should not be allowed as if there are literally the best colleges in the world (should not all colleges be superior since all of them provide higher education?). Though all this shows one conclusion and that these problems need to be fixed, otherwise all of us will suffer. I reckon that most people seeking higher education are immigrants or first-generation Americans that are not at all wealthy to be throwing their money around. And not only immigrants but anyone who goes to institutions of higher learning will suffer financially (when it is not necessary). Most of these useless requirements are the majority of classes for a degree like Science: https://catalog.edmonds.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=61&poid=14782 , while they only form a minority for some like Culinary arts: https://catalog.edmonds.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=61&poid=14803 . All of us want our money to be worth it, so if we could only remove these classes from our curricula we would have to pay less for our degree and at the same time graduate faster and pursue further higher learning. I kid you not, if I did not have to take these requirement classes for my degree, I would be done with a Science Degree in computer science in only a year or so and pay half. Why then are two years required with a significantly higher cost? If no one wants to fix this problem for us then we have to fix it for ourselves, otherwise we will suffer and keep suffering from generation to generation. Do we really want our children to live the same financial ruin we did? All of us have to choose.   
  
In conclusion, there might be more absurd facts I missed about higher education institutions, but these are the ones that need immediate response. We need colleges to change their program requirements, and to rethink their purpose in society. Once you graduate high school, you have a greater freedom in choosing what you want to learn, and that you have greater options than you had in high school. It does not make sense that I need to continue where I left off from high school at my own expense. If the college requires me to take classes for my degree that do not make sense, then how about these colleges pay for it because the classes clearly have no purpose in my specialized degree. Colleges would be much cheaper and efficient if they would just only address these points. Otherwise, it should be our duty, of the people, to fix our country’s education system, and especially the institutions of higher learning, for the betterment of democracy and life.

Be sure to keep repeating those total bullshit lies to yourselves over the next few decades, every time the old white guy who replaces Ginsburg, rules oppositely of how she would have and sets social progress back decades.

Just remember to look on the bright side; at least you didn’t have to suffer through a Hillary Clinton presidency.

Yes, it was your right to refuse to vote for her, either by voting 3rd party or not voting at all, but like all other freedoms, the right to vote does not mean freedom from social consequences.

freedom,liberal,How to bridge the economic left with the religious right,"Just finished listening to the Ezra Klein show where he discusses with political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson on the intersection (feedback loop? tense alliance?) between white identity politics and the economic right (the drivers of wealth inequality) in the United States.  It is a great interview and worth a listen: [The Ezra Klein Show: How inequality and white identity politics feed each other](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vdGhlZXpyYWtsZWluc2hvdw&ep=14&episode=NDBmNjA5ZGUtMTU0OS0xMWVhLTk0MmYtMDc1MTA5OWQxOWNi)

What I am struck with as a thought at the end of the episode: is there some sort of way to create a bridge between the liberal left and the Evangelical right when it comes to economics?

Clearly, when it comes to social issues, the two sides remain hugely divided.  Abortion, feminism, and LGBT+ rights are all topics that the two sides may never be able to reconcile.  However, it strikes me that the gaping inequality within the US is an issue that many within the Evangelical movement would possibly be willing to approach from a more liberal perspective.  Greed and usury are both extremely antithetical to the teaching of Jesus (at least from my outside understanding as a Jew), while charity toward the poor is a huge motivator for many Christian institutions.

I would also like to believe that those on the Christian right would reject the hard dive into white identity politics that we have seen from the Trump administration and many Republican representatives like Tom Cotton, although I do not have polling data to support that claim.

I know that these issues tend to place lower for many religious right voters, with the social issues placing higher, especially since they have been framed by the Republican Party and right-wing media as attacks on religious freedom and social morality.   But I know what a strong position religion holds in the lives of many Americans, so I believe that bridging to these institutions is important to eventually reach their parishioners.  I also think that many of their parishioners also represent constituents who would benefit greatly from economic left policies that would drive down wealth inequality within the US.

Is there some sort of way the two sides could come to enough of a truce on social issue politics, or put that aside long enough, for them to work towards more liberal economic policies that would address wealth inequality, lack of economic mobility, and lack of economic safety net within the US?  And is this even a potential bridge of interest for the religious right?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/i53mhl/how_to_bridge_the_economic_left_with_the/,1596759557.0,i53mhl
freedom,liberal,Republican Clown Doug Collins just spent 10 minutes lying his ass off in congress.,"So for the last 10 minutes, during the opening of today's impeachment hearing, Doug Collins flapped his gums while he falsely claimed that Democrats are ignoring facts, while plainly ignoring all facts of the case. Now he's running his mouth about pointless procedural bullshit that is irrelevant to the matters of the hearing. This group continually just whines and cries because they cannot stand the fact that they hitched their cart to a poisoned and toxic horse. Now the joke of a human Matt Gaetz begins shouting like the pathetic frat boy loudmouth he is. The whole strategy at this point, for republicans, is to disrupt, delay, interrupt, obfuscate, bloviate etc.

They ignore facts while saying Democrats are ignoring facts  
They make the whole thing into a shit show while claiming Democrats are creating a shit show  
They lie left and right while saying democrats are lying.  


They have no integrity and only possess the capability to project.

They claim the institution of congress is in great danger, while manifestly representing that very threat.

freedom,liberal,Questions from a Conservative:,"Hi friends, I’m here to learn and not to start WWIII. I just had a few questions and I’d love to hear from those on the other side of the aisle. To give a summary of who I am and my beliefs, I’m a half White, half Hispanic libertarian-conservative. I believe that a small government gives people the most freedom and through that freedom, we can all thrive. I’m also Catholic, so I believe in traditional marriage BUT I do believe gay marriage should be legal. I’m also pro life and believe life should be protected from conception until natural death. I’m a big supporter of clean energy and the environment. I’m also a 2nd Amendment supporter. I graduated from a University of California school with a degree in sociology so I’m pretty well versed in Marxist and more left leaning thinking. In fact studying those schools of thought made me solidify my conservative beliefs. I voted for President Trump and I like some of what he’s done and I hate others. I also HATE his twitter feed.... it drives me insane.

My questions:

1. A couple of decades ago liberals and conservatives were able to respectfully talk with one another, but sadly I do not see that happen much today. Do you think there’s a chance we can once again come together and talk politics? I’m a firm believer that the United States is like the Bald Eagle, it cannot fly without the left or the right wing. She needs both.

2. Do you believe that the mainstream media has some bias?

3. Do you read the Constitution as a textualist/originalist?

4. Why do you think the Democratic Party is supporting socialism more and more?

5. Do you have conservative friends and do you have respectful conversations with them?

6. Do you listen to conservative thinkers to gain insight on conservative thought? For example, Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager, Mark Levin, Milton Friedman, or others?

7. Do you support the ever growing disdain for conservatives on US campuses? During my experiences at my university, and the countless videos and experiences I’ve seen/read about, it saddens me to see how much hate we receive.

8. Do you believe in some conservative views?

9. Can we be friends? A lot of my friends are liberal and I do value their opinions and I enjoy listening to their views. I honestly just want to be able to have these conversations without name-calling and spewing hate at one another.

freedom,liberal,"If Trump and Steve King from Iowa were Democrats, they'd been kicked out from our party with a note,""Don't reapply"". Only the G.O.P. could tolerate these type of totally racist hate mongers in their party for so long.","Yes, for a very long time, Republican party members were winning their local,state and national elections by taking full advantages of their core supporters' lack of education.

And what does lack of education bring : utter ignorance.

Steve King,the congressman from Iowa was taking full advantage of his followers' ignorance to spread his hate filled diatribe which're similar to the views of all the White Nationalists here as well as Geert Wilders, a far-right  Dutch politician and many others like him in Europe whose racist world views match with Trump and Mr. King's.

But Mr. King who branded together all the children coming from South America with a few drug smugglers saying ""these young immigrants have calves like cantaloupe,from hauling marijuana over the border,"" do not understand that by painting other people with black color he's asking those people to hate all the White Americans.

And that'll be totally antithesis of what almost 200+ millions of White Americans stand for.

These great Americans couldn't make their candidate Hillary win because of direct interference in our election process by Putin and Mr. Comey, but they'd never talk like some racist bastards from the other side of the spectrum in their lives.

Also by blaming the Democrats for trying to ""fill the void of nearly 60 million aborted babies since 1973, by raising somebody else's babies,"" Mr. King proved to us that he and Trump want to turn all the  Americans like them. Totally racist monsters.

And that talk from Mr. King about ""raising other people's babies"" was the dumbest thing that any politician can ever say on national tv, because we're not raising other people's babies but our own American babies.

Those babies might look different from Mr. King's color of the skin or his cultures or different in their religious views but nonetheless if they're born in America like Obama was, they're American citizens.

And if some babies or children left their countries in the South America because of our neglect or direct involvement in those countries' insecurity, then it becomes incumbent on us to accept those babies or children and give them shelter, food and a chance to lead a decent life in our great country.

But for Trump and Mr. King to talk in such generalized terms about these babies and also other refugees, who're coming to our country because of the Republican party's deliberate attempt to subvert those countries in the middle-east and in Latin America, these two Republican blowhards and many others like them are proving to us and the whole world that they do not want America to progress or go forward.

Their main intention is to take us back to those dark old days of '50s when the minorities were treated like cattle in this country with no power to vote, no liberty, justice and personal freedom as is enshrined in gold letters in our Bill of Rights for all the Americans irrespective of their color of the skin or their different cultures and their different than us customs as well as freedom to worship any God they wanted to. 

But to Trump and these racists monsters like Mr. King from the other side of the isles in Congress, our Constitution means nothing.

Actually to Trump who never read the Constitution and Steve King who read it, our Bill of Rights be damned. It's just their way for all the Americans or else the highway.

In fact if they've enough votes, the Republicans in Congress will amend each and every clauses written in our Constitution, especially the clauses written in the Bill of Rights.

Their hatred for other people, who don't look like them or don't speak like them or don't pray to the Gods like them, is so intense that these bunch of racist Republicans led by Trump and Mr. King will pass 20+ more amendments to our Constitution to take away all the rights as our original writers of the Constitution wanted everyone in this country to have irrespective of their political or moral differences.

So its no wonder that we got rid of these hatemongers from our Democratic party long time back when we expelled all the Dixie Democrats and the Reagan Democrats.

Racist people like Trump and Steve King won't even get a job to clean our toilets in the Democratic Party Headquarters in Washington DC.",44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/5zipvy/if_trump_and_steve_king_from_iowa_were_democrats/,1489576169.0,5zipvy
freedom,liberal,Trumped Faith: Donald Trump and the Return of White Exceptionalism,"The undying loyalty of Donald's Trump's remaining supporters serves as a canary in the coal mine. Their willingness to follow him into the dark sewers of his misogynistic vulgar rhetoric, is an expose' of dark truths. Using Clinton as a most capable scapegoat, Trump has emboldened his base to completely undress their beliefs and desperation. He looks on as they expose what attitudes and actions they are willing to endorse for a president that will give them what they want. For a time, America was afforded the luxury of pretending that the dark periods of sexism, discrimination, misogyny and racism we largely behind us. Over the course of this election we have discovered they are very much alive; quietly lurking in dark shadows and waiting for permission to return to the light of socially acceptable attitudes.


The rejections of Trump's advances by the majority of the American public have been met with furious responses by his alt-right base. Trump's foreplay indulged their deepest fantasy of making America great again by revisiting the 1950's. The red-faced retort of his most rabid fan base seeks to blame anyone and everyone for the implosion of Trump except Donald Trump. The often frank and offensive style of Trump's speech not only built rapport and trust with supporters; it gave them permission to follow his lead.


His base made quick work of blurring the lines between the shackles of political correctness and the gutters of human behavior. It required little coaxing for an ill informed, alt-right militia to begin splicing half-truths with shockingly profane sentiments and rage as ammunition for a verbal shoot out at the O.K. Coral. With Hillary Clinton well positioned to play the bad guy, there is no behavior or sentiment off limits. Her perceived lows of criminal conduct redefines acceptable behavior in response. In this alternate reality everyone that doubles down on angry rhetoric, despite its factual basis, is John Wayne in a white hat attempting to save the republic. Ride ‘em Cowboy. This is the America we know and love.


Who wouldn’t be spitting and furious in their place? Who wouldn’t try to go back, if only a moment, to a time when their authority was unchallenged? A time when women were subservient victims of your whim with little voice, rights, or recourse. A time when other races, sexual orientations, and religions knew their place. A time when institutions gave priority to their religious preferences. A time when the world trembled in their presence and the people on it were theirs to dominate in any way they saw fit.

--

The tantrums we are witnessing today are the result of declining white exceptionalism in America. It's zenith is often pointed to as the 1950’s; the period just before civil rights marches forced a discussion that rudely interrupted America's TV dinners. A time before Martin Luther King Jr. implored a devoutly religious nation to dig deeper into it's understanding of what it professed to believe. White exceptionalism indulges a fantasy that America was its greatest when it was far less concerned about making good on its own promise of freedom and equality for all as god-given right. We are lead to believe It is mere coincidence that the predominate culture of this time period is white and christian while other cultures, orientations, and creeds are secondary if not subservient.


As a slogan, “Make America Great Again.” is the result of brilliant engineering. It provides ample room for misinterpretation. What is meant by ”America”? What is implied by ”great again”? Everyone believes they know the definitive meaning while the actual answers differ radically. The base then is emboldened by its collective numbers, believing they are speaking the same language. White supremacists can be part of the club, misogynist authoritarians have a place to take root, and sexual predatory sentiments can take haven under an umbrella of faux moral superiority provided by the religious right. In aligning with Trump, you don’t need to come out and admit to any of the unsavory, underlying motives. You can if you wish. If you don’t, you can duck in quietly, take a seat, and it’s simply understood. We’re going to force everyone to go back in time to when things were great for us. Wink wink.

Donald Trump is the unwitting mascot of white exceptionalism; a caricature of success, excess, and the good old boys club. He has successfully sold an image for the past 30 years as America's premiere boss, leveraging the inertia of his brand name to sell an image of success to the working class. From his university, to his real estate seminars, and his books one thing is clear; Trump’s strongest skill has been selling the illusion that he’s letting you into his club. He has made a fortune doing it for decades.


Are we to actually believe this savvy businessman is looking to create more competition for himself? That through these offerings he seeks to create an army of competent real estate and business moguls? Of course not. These business lines are created to sell an image of success through a self-made story line to America’s working class. The underlying reality is that the true fee for entry into his echelon is not a course for thousands of dollars, it is a meager loan of one million dollars. It would be laughable if it weren't so sad to be taking thousands of dollars from American families in trade for his magic beans.


Trump's business proposal to consumers has always played to our gambling sensibilities. This election is no different. For the low cost of one vote we stand a chance to win it all. What do you have to loose? In the primaries, the GOP took the bait; betting their credibility at the Trump Casino. Even before the election concludes they have counted it as a loss. This is not because he's a revolutionary adept at cleaning a house of ill repute with his supreme business acumen. It's because he is a loose canon who eviscerates the credibility of his Republican allies; selling out the values it claims fealty to as a primary platform fixture. Both parties have done their share to erode their own credibility for more than 40 years. Trump simply sought to leverage a depressed asset in the GOP for his own gain. This is Trump's typical mode of operation.


Trump's campaign has also been successful at completely inverting the signs of failed candidacy with his base. Enlisting the aid of public relations strategists and conservative apologists, reality becomes alt-reality. Losing GOP's endorsements means you are finally unrestrained instead of the appearance of a serious warning sign. Long-standing, conservative-leaning institutions are forced to support his very controversial opposition by virtue of his own vitriol and pettiness and it's herald as great success. Negative media attention means the media is in on the fix. An absence of Presidential endorsements is even more confirmation that they are on the right path. For this audience, anything can twisted into an obvious benefit that emboldens their base to indulge beliefs of convenience. It speaks to the very real danger of naive, dogmatic belief focused through the most distorted of lenses of conservative punditry. With the reputation of the GOP now in flames, Trump's conservative media supporters board the Trump Train to follow his audience wherever the charismatic leader decides to take them.

What has been the most shocking of all in this election is to watch the religious right trade its final shreds of credibility as the self proclaimed gold standard of morality by supporting Trump as their candidate. They perform ridiculous contortions and present self defeating logic as defense for an indefensible double standard. Were it Howard Stern saying the things Trump has said, the outfall from the religious right would be swift and merciless. They would be doing everything in their power to have him removed from the airways. Had it been a gay or lesbian who wanted to grab woman by the pussy. a fevered plot would arise to brand her a predatory, sexual demon and threat to society at large. However, when it concerns a presidential candidate that pays the weakest lip service to religious beliefs while validating their aspiration to regain dominance, pointing to his own words and actions is the greatest of conspiracies by the hand of the media to invalidate the power of their beloved leader.


Despite this very blatant hypocrisy, evangelicals embrace moral relativism and continue to take a quiet seat on the Trump Train. The promise for their portion of the spoils in his sales pitch proves worth the expense of the very virtues they allege set them apart. To continue to extol these virtues of superior discernment and judgement, that had long ago been outsourced to corporate spokesmen like Hannity and Limbaugh, turns their claim of moral superiority into a punchline. Witnessing these pied pipers lead their respective flocks over the cliff of credibility is truly breathtaking to witness. May God’s will be done.


As with every meaningful movement for equality prior, we need not look to the religious attitudes of white christian culture as a barometer of what is moral conduct. Weather it be the abolishment of slavery in the 1830's, the right for African Americans to vote in the 1870's, the right for woman to vote in the 1920's, and the civil rights movement of the 1960's, the allegiance of this faction has been made clear; to manipulate religious belief to the service of white christian power through whatever means necessary. This is quite the sobering admission they make, albeit unintended. I believe it is the moral obligation of all Americans to ensure that religious Trump supporters be made to choke on the hypocrisy of their position by shining the light of reason upon it. These are the true demons that must be exercised from America's soul once and for all. They must be made to understand that allowing ignorance to parade as virtue will not be tolerated.

Trump is not an answer to America's problems. Trump is an opportunity to leverage America’s problems through the emptiest rhetoric in order to serve his narcissism and restore white exceptionalism by whatever means necessary. A wall. Religious profiling. Law and Order. Fascism. Nukes. Whatever works. The ends justify the means. To believe this will make America great in any way is entertaining the most dangerous disillusion.


America was and is still an experiment. The central idea that defines America's greatness continues to be its most progressive; freedom and equality for all. Trump reminds us that America will never be made great by indulging our tribal fears and provoking our most base urges. America is only made great when we are in pursuit of this revolutionary idea by inspiring the best in each other. We must look to promote true examples of leadership that don't convince us to extinguish the torch of liberty but inspire us to carry it so that we can proudly hand it to future generations.

freedom,liberal,"""LetterToRepublicans Part Four: Christian Nation."" What are your thoughts?","#‎LetterToRepublicans‬ Part Four: Christian Nation


Okay so Muslims aren't ruining America. Immigrants aren't ruining America. You know what is ruining America? Everyone is trying to take Christ out of Christmas! Our founding fathers were Christian! America was founded as a Christian country! America is now a Christian country! Everyone who doesn't love God should get out.


Yikes, such a strong statement. A strong and incredibly incorrect statement. In the age of the internet/the age of information I don't even understand how people still believe this to be true. Besides that I don't even understand how it matters what America's founding fathers' religions were. Our country today is home to millions of people of many religions and beliefs. Why would the personal religious beliefs of a few men several hundred years ago really matter in our law today? It doesn't. Plain and simple. We are in a different time. We can look to the constitution, as we have, to see for ourselves what the founding fathers had intended for the country. The Constitution makes no mention of God (1). The Declaration of Independence mentions ""the laws of Nature and Nature's God"" and defended that all men had rights ""endowed by their Creator (1)."" There is no mention of ""Christian Nation"" or even a religious God at all. We can argue what they meant by ""Creator"" but fact is these men were very careful in the wording to not emphasize any specific religious deity. At the time demographically America was predominantly Christian. The fact the founding fathers did not endorse Christianity while it was still dominant was not an accident. They wanted this country to be secular. Our founding fathers were not all God-fearing Christian men (2). Some were. Some weren't. Many of those that were religious still understood the value of keeping that as a personal affair and out of politics (2).


The current platform of trying to force one religion on everybody hasn't tried to be done so extensively since the Puritans established local theocracies upon first immigrating here in the 1600s (10). It was understandable then because religiously-ruled governments were normal in that time. Never in America has this been tried to such a huge degree as to expand across the entire country. It's a newer endeavor, and one that is arguable completely un-American, considering that one of the reasons America was considered to be so great after the writing of the constitution is because of the decision to maintain our power in the people, rather than a ""divinely"" inspired government (9). The Founding Fathers were very familiar with the role of a religious government, as it was the typical scenario in their time. Today we see attempts at theocracies in action in Muslim and middle eastern countries (10). Historically governments were ruled by religion and that religion was forced upon it's people. The founding of America recognized this as an unfit way of governance and ensured the freedom to practice one's religion without fear of persecution or proselytization (1,9). This would be the basis for the countries of the rest of the world to turn to. People came to America to escape their government-imposed religious persecution.


""Many of the Founding Fathers worried that religion would corrupt the state and, conversely, that the state would corrupt religion (2)."" ""Hostile to the political theology of both the Catholic Church and Protestant kings, Paine celebrated a vision for America that reflected the democratic god of nature and reason (2)."" ""Jefferson explained his support for religious freedom in practical terms: ""(I)t does me no injury for my neighbor to believe in twenty gods or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg."" (2)"" ""James Madison challenged the idea that religion in politics would lead men to ""cooperate for their common good"" and asserted instead that it would make them ""vex and oppress each other."" (2)""""Benjamin Franklin was the only self-professed deist among the leading founders (2)."" ""Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were strong advocates for the complete separation of church and state. John Adams and George Washington believed that religion was essential to the cultivation of a virtuous citizenry, an essential trait of any successful republic (2)."" In the 1790's evangelical Christianity surged in response to the quickly growing numbers of skeptics amount students, physicians, and western settlers. It wasn't until the 19th century that the ""christian nation"" myth rooted in the mind of the religious as a way to establish a national identity and it wasn't until the 20th century that it became a political platform (2).


As if it wasn't clear enough in the initial documents written by the founding fathers, we don't have to look much further than the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli which was started by George Washington, it was signed by John Adams and ratified unanimously by the senate that was still half occupied by those who signed the Constitution (2). In this document it states plain as can be ""the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion. (2)"" You would have to be a special kind of daft to not understand those words. Go ahead. Reread them. Really.


Some of the first migrants to the 13 colonies were the Puritans/Pilgrims in what was called ""The Great Migration."" These people were leaving England for fear that King Charles was going to impose a Catholic rule when he married the Catholic daughter of King Henry IV of France (which he was planning on in a secret treaty enacted for the marriage in order by the King of France) (3). People were fleeing in order to NOT be subjected to the rule of an enforced religion. Exactly what the religious right are attempting to do to others today.


In 1864 Congress approved the motto ""In God We Trust"" can be placed on American currency (4).The first paper currency with the motto was from 1957 (4). In 1956 Congress passed making ""In God We Trust"" the national motto as approved by Eisenhower (5). In 1956 Eisenhower also added the words ""Under God"" to the constitution, against the implied wishes of the original writer (6).
This was during the apex of the cold war with McCarthyism and the hunt for communists in the country (6). The original pledge also included a salute to the flag when the words ""to the flag"" were read. This salute identified too similarly as a Nazi salute after WWII and was removed and replaced with holding the hand over the heart (7). So our secular pledge was made religious by the fear of communism. Eisenhower adding this religious motto to our country is unconstitutional by not maintaining a separation between church and state (8). One day we can hopefully rid ourselves of this mistake but no president will want to face the harsh public outcry of the righteous religious by doing so anytime soon.


I have no problem with people worshiping their God. I have a BIG problem when you pass laws or national standards promoting the beliefs of any religion. Which happens to be the Republican Party's favorite past-time. Nobody will tell me how to take care of my body because of their religious beliefs. Nobody will tell me how to live my life because of their religious beliefs. No company should be exempt from providing medical care (birth control) to their employees because of religious beliefs. The Christina Right have seemed to confuse the fact that America is a safe place to practice religious beliefs with turning around and completely reverting back to the systematic enforced religious rule of early governments. America does not cater to you and your religious beliefs. Other individuals having the same rights as you (LGBT, Muslims, Atheists, women, etc) does not infringe upon your rights. Others breaking your religious code (sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll) does not warrant shaming and abuse. Just because you can't act a certain way due to your beliefs does not mean you get to legally impose that on others. This country is not a christian/catholic country. Eisenhower screwed everyone over who doesn't acclimate to religious beliefs and now we must live with it until the crazy religious realize this country wasn't built for them. It was built for Us. All of us. The believers. The nonbelievers. The unsure. The don't-really-care. We all live in this country together and we all have to learn to get along.

Lessig would revolutionize and open  up the internet for the future and pass The Citizens Equality Act of 2017

>The Citizen Equality Act of 2017 is a package of reforms that would allow Congress to listen to voters instead of a few funders.

>It changes the way we fund campaigns, ends gerrymandering, and protects the right of all citizens to vote.

>These reforms will give us — finally — what we were promised: a government of, by, and for the people.

 Lessig has met the polling requirements for the next Democrat Presidential debate but has been denied admittances Democrstic Party insiders change debate admittance rules to exclude him.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig

Lessig is a candidate for the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Lessig is a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on copyright, trademark, and radio frequency spectrum, particularly in technology applications. In 2001, he founded Creative Commons, a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon and to share legally. Prior to his most recent appointment at Harvard, he was a professor of law at Stanford Law School, where he founded the Center for Internet and Society, and at the University of Chicago. He is a former board member of the Free Software Foundation and Software Freedom Law Center; the Washington, D.C. lobbying groups Public Knowledge and Free Press; and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.[2]
As a political activist, Lessig has called for state-based activism to promote substantive reform of government with a Second Constitutional Convention.[3] In May 2014, he launched a crowd-funded political action committee which he termed Mayday PAC with the purpose of electing candidates to Congress who would pass campaign finance reform.[4] Lessig is also the co-founder of Rootstrikers, and is on the boards of MapLight and Represent.us.[5] He serves on the advisory boards of the Democracy Café[6] and the Sunlight Foundation.[7]

Then the Hillary campaign insiders changed the rules

> As CNN specified in a late September memo, to qualify a candidate had to poll at 1 percent in the ""polls released between August 1, 2015 and October 10, 2015."" The first debate was October 12.

>So, we believed we had our guidelines. And as such, we worked hard--and spent our campaign's resources--to meet this clarified goal. It wasn't easy, as most of the national polls didn't even include Lessig's name. But then a week ago, a Monmouth poll of Democrats nationally found him at the qualifying percentage. Then an NBC poll found the same. HuffPost Pollster now lists three polls at 1%. Since the Monmouth poll, no poll that included Lessig's name found him with anything less than 1%.

>But apparently it did not matter. Late last week, the DNC again changed the rules for participation in the debates. Just at the point that it seemed Lessig was about to get in, the DNC has shut the door.

>We were informed of this change in a phone call late last week that I had with the DNC political director. During that call, I was told that the DNC participation standard for the debates was for a candidate to be at one percent in three polls conducted, ""six weeks prior to the debate""--not the clarified rule cited earlier by Wasserman-Shultz and the DNC political director that a candidate had to be at one percent in three polls conducted ""in the six weeks prior to the debate.""

tyranny,liberal,"""They’ll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner, you should reject these voices.""","""The U.S. deputy chief of mission in Libya, Gregory Hicks, says that he was told not to speak to a member of Congress about Benghazi without a State Department lawyer present, that he received a phone call from Hillary Clinton’s chief of staff disapproving of his discussion with Representative Jason Chaffetz, and that he was “effectively demoted” afterwards.
The controversy over the editing of the “talking points” revolves around the steady deletion of factual information from the explanation to the American people, leading to the emphasis of a protest that the U.S. personnel on the ground did not report.
In an effort to ferret out leaks, the Department of Justice secretly reviewed the phone records of at least 20 phone lines of Associated Press reporters — their work, home, and cell-phone lines. The move is unprecedented and has journalists up in arms because it means that a journalist can no longer guarantee the confidentiality of any phone conversation with a source that wishes to not be publicly identified.
The Department of Justice went before a judge and alleged that Fox News reporter James Rosen was a criminal “co-conspirator” in leaking classified information, in order to access his personal e-mail accounts. No reporter has ever been prosecuted as a co-conspirator under the Espionage Act; in all previous cases, it has been used to prosecute the leaker of classified information, not the recipient. The classified information in question was an analyst’s assessment that North Korea would respond to new U.N. sanctions with another nuclear test.
In another bit of punishment for whistleblowers, the Department of Justice Inspector General determined that former Arizona U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke leaked a document smearing Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent John Dodson, an Operation Fast and Furious whistle-blower. The IG concluded that “his explanations for why he did not believe his actions were improper were not credible.”
Despite all these ruthless efforts to stop leaks elsewhere in government, the Cincinnati office of the IRS leaked unapproved applications for nine conservative groups to the media web site ProPublica. The IRS separately released confidential information about the National Organization for Marriage. The IRS asserted, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration concluded, the releases were “inadvertent.” The problem with the “inadvertent” explanation is that the Human Rights Campaign said they were sent the private IRS filing from NOM via a “whistleblower.”
The Environmental Protection Agency waived their fees for Freedom of Information Act requests from “green” or environmental groups while keeping them in place for conservative groups.""

what's been going on recently in and outside of the current administration is disgusting. what's more disgusting is to see people defend the IRS, DOJ, etc. in order to protect their ideological obsession with the president. i identify as liberal (especially socially), but if something happens on a scale like this that is so clearly reprehensible, i dont give a flying fuck if it makes my side (whichever it may be) look bad....i fucking give them hell. so should you. im disappointed that suddenly, all of my aggressively political liberal facebook friends could care less about what's going on because it makes them look like shit. they will casually forget it all happened and, if brought up against their will, cast the blame on the previous (oh wait, previous-previous) administration. if you defend what's going on and show not the slightest concern for the state of our government, then you're pathetic. 

""“Unfortunately, you’ve grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that’s at the root of all our problems; some of these same voices also doing their best to gum up the works...They’ll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner, you should reject these voices."" -Obama (~2 fucking weeks ago)

tyranny,liberal,Can someone explain the Liberal point of view? I just fail to understand their logic.,"    I am probably just going to get spammed with hate mail. Just to help you understand my point of view I am a strong supporter of the Libertarian ideas. My vote is Ron Paul for 2012.
     I don't see how limiting our freedoms and raising taxes is a ""Progressive"" idea. America fought against tyranny for freedom. We fought against the monarchy for human rights. We the people stood our ground for what we believe in and won our liberty. 
    I am a gun owner. I am not sure how getting rid of all of the law abiding citizens guns is a step in the right direction. I believe that ""a government that fears its citizens being armed should reconsider what they are doing"". Criminals will always have guns. Look at Mexico; only the criminals have guns and they are killing thousands of innocents because the innocents have nothing for protection. Now look at Switzerland. Everyone is armed to the teeth and Switzerland is one of the safest places on Earth. Everyone, for the most part, in Switzerland understands and respects firearms for the good they are capable of.
    Why does the Democratic party claim to want out of the war? Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize for ""Inspiring Hope"". Obama has authorized the military to invade many other countries and put more of our miltary lives in the line of danger. War is not peace. If Alfred Nobel was still alive, he would never let a war monger take the prize for peace!
    Can someone explain how dumping a never ending amount of money into a country creates prosperity? Spending creates debt; the problem that our country is facing now. Inflation of the American Dollar is bad for the whole world. The Dollar is also the reserve currency for Europe. The fact that Europe has the Dollar as its reserve currency proves that the world used to once believe in America, The America that I am referring to is the America where people could depend on themselves. Charity comes from the individual, not the government.
    How are handouts to people good for them in the long run? People and government bureaucrats get a surplus of money and then get used to it. Once they get used to the large amounts of ""free"" money, they cannot function on what they used to. This ""free"" money is a crutch and is used people get dependent. Once someone is dependent on the government, they are forced to keep the party that crippled them in power.
    Can someone explain how the idea of the government controlling your life is a good thing for you? I was put out of work because the California condor is breeding. A bird was put before the American worker. The Delta Smelt is a 3"" fish that is harming the farmers and their production. A fish is coming before America's largest producer. This impacts the entire country. I think the madness is a power trip by some Liberal that wants to attempt to justify his/her position. How is more regulation on everything we do help? Why can't I do to my property what I want? If I want to do something to my property, I have to go submit papers and get permission to put something on MY LAND. This is land that I pay for and maintain. This is land that I pay taxes for. But let me reiterate and just mention the Liberal with a power trip is the reason why I can't do what I want with my land.
    Why so much tax? There is a reason everyone complains about taxes (with the exceptions of the government/government workers). Taxes hurt business and limit what peoples' capabilities. I do not understand how the government justifies stealing my money to help ""spread the wealth"". The Democratic Party and the Republican Party have proven that they use our money to support corrupt businesses and war. It must be easy to spend everyone else's money.
      I see political correctness as being racist. I don't see in color. I just see people as people. I think that the P.C. argument is made by people that want to be seen as so ""not racist"" that they do anything that they can in order to separate themselves from the supposed racists. This action within itself creates racism. Affirmative action is in place to make a separation between races. Class and racial warfare is how political parties make caucuses and manipulate the masses by putting the massing into subcategories. A political cartoon I once saw in a California textbook showed a university without affirmative action and the university was 100% white. There was a speech bubble that said ""Without affirmative action in place, I can really see how it makes me not see any difference in people"". This to me was the real racist statement. This comment undermined everything that anti-racism is about; not seeing the difference in people. I believe that the Democratic Party is also trying too hard to cover their racist roots. It was the Republican Party that freed the slaves and daren't you forget that.
    Can people help explain this thought process to me. I am really interested in learning about how Liberals think. These thoughts are not attempting to be slanderous. These are legitimate issues that I just don’t understand seeing from the Progressive perspective.

propaganda,liberal,"“Antifa"" has made a statement:","TO: ALL MEDIA
PUBLIC STATEMENT FROM “ANTIFA” IN RESPONSE TO THE THREATS ISSUED BY UNITED STATES PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP
Dear Mr. Trump:
Let us be perfectly clear:
“Antifa” isn’t an organization. There’s no membership, no meetings, no dues, no rules, no leaders, no structure. It is, literally, an idea and nothing more. Even the claim of this author to represent “Antifa” is one made unilaterally for the purposes of this communication and nothing more; there is no governing body nor trademark owner to dispute the author’s right to represent “AntiFa.”
“Antifa” is a neologism constructed from a contraction of the phrase “anti-fascist.” The truth is, there’s no such thing as being “anti-Fascist.” Either you are a decent human being with a conscience, or you are a fascist.
The ostensible president of the United States has, today, openly declared that he is a fascist, and that he intends to turn the military power of the United States into a fascist tool.
Now there is no question, and we can stop pretending that this man represents anything but the worst in humanity, which his supporters embody.
And that is the only effect his words will have.
It will likely be no problem for LEO to identify the author of this document, who also has maintained the “AntiFa” page on Facebook since founding it in 2017.
The author of this document is unconcerned with that inevitability because neither that author, nor this document, has been involved in a crime of any sort in any way.
But, since both the “president” and the media insist on acting as though “AntiFa” is this big, scary organization, the author supposes it’s time for “AntiFa” to make a statement.
Thus:
“AntiFa supports and defends the right of all people to live free from oppressive abuse of power, whether that power is unjustly derived from wealth, status as an employer, or political popularity.
Particularly, AntiFa defends and supports the right of oppressed and marginalized people to protest, march, and engage in civil disobedience in pursuit of justice. While it is never our intent to engage in violent or destructive behavior, we cannot and will not take responsibility for telling people how they are allowed to be righteously outraged. We prefer and encourage non-violent action. We also understand that some people just aren’t feeling that nice anymore. Their feelings are entirely justified, and it is neither our role nor our privilege to tell them otherwise.
Mass civil disobedience is what happens when people say they’re hurting and whoever’s hurting them refuses to stop.
Stop hurting them. Fix your broken systems. Get real and meaningful psychological evaluations and background checks - police in some nations have to pass a more stringent test to carry pepper spray than any police department in the US, or the US military, have in place. As a direct and possibly deliberate consequence, our military and paramilitary personnel simply cannot be assumed to be fighting in the interests of the people of this country.
We’ve all seen the photos. This destruction and burning and looting is largely the behavior of outsiders; white people taking advantage of the situation both to enrich themselves by looting under cover of the protests, and to provide excuses for uncontrolled fascist elements within our military and police forces as plausible cover for killing more black, brown, and poor people without fear of sanction. The so-called “accellerationists” who have committed to ensuring that, any time a marginalized community stands up and demands justice, construct a narrative of criminality and destruction that white bigots and affluent oligarchs who benefit from our broken system to validate their bigotry and injustice retroactively. They are successful in this for two reasons: because people like you are easily manipulated in your banal, self-serving ignorance, and because people like you are more than happy to passive-aggressively reap the benefits of pretending to believe this destruction is the act of the oppressed.
This game has gone on for decades on an endless loop since the very dawn of the civil rights era, and we the people are saying ‘no more.’”
And that, “President” Trump, is your solution. No more. Get the dirt out of your law enforcement and your military. Get the dirt out of your government and administration. Ideally, resign now and take your VP and cabinet with you; Nancy Pelosi isn’t a great deal of improvement, but she’ll only be president for a few months.
You can’t arrest 100 million of us, sir, and you would be well-advised not to try. If you think that targeting and “making an example of” the author of this document will get you anywhere, you may rest assured that this author is more than prepared to allow his real name to be used as a rallying cry for justice and civil disobedience from coast to coast.
It is time for you and everyone who thinks like you to understand that whether black, red, brown, white, or any other color, Americans are done living in a nation of empty platitudes and broken promises.
Traditionally, this type of document is accompanied by a list of “demands.” Here are our demands:
-Universal single payer health care, without regard for citizenship status.
-Universal basic income WITH a federal job guarantee, under which the federal government becomes the “employer of last resort.” Involuntary unemployment is a function of profiteering by fascist capitalist oligarchs who are willing to sacrifice the lives of others for their own enrichment. It must end.
-The abolition of “right to work laws” which do exactly the opposite of ensuring anyone’s right to work.
-Publicly funded higher education.
-Robust and effective social welfare programs to include child care, education, employment training and counseling, parenting skills training, and life skills training including fiscal education.
-A requirement that functional proficiency in media, political, and economic literacy be demonstrated to graduate high school.
-The creation of a publicly funded non-partisan media source to serve as the primary source of government information, to be overseen and managed day to day by a coalition of well-known communicators, political scientists, and other experts in propaganda to strip ALL bias from official information before it is broadcast.
-Federal charges of treason filed against anyone willfully and knowingly attempting to minimize public perception of the impact and risks of the coronavirus.
-Reform of whistleblower laws to ensure they have teeth, and particularly to ensure that a whistleblower, acting in good faith, is not identified to the public, ever.
In the end, Mr. “President,” the simple reality is that “AntiFa” isn’t a thing. You can’t end it, you can’t arrest it, and you can’t silence it. Nor, in any decent nation, would the attempt even be made.
“Antifa” means “Anti-Fascism.” The only position that opposes that is fascism. In the end, there is no “organization” that you can “declare terrorists.”
You, sir, and yours, are the terrorists, and your victims are done putting up with it.
America is not, in spite of having an openly admitted fascist as “president,” a fascist nation. We’ve had wars about this. The fascists are 0-2.
Please, Mr. “President” - let’s not try to make it 0-3? Because it will never, ever be 1-2, and none of us wants to see the death toll from your attempt to make it so.
Currently, media and other actors wishing to contact this author may do so through the page. Should Mr. Zuckerberg, who has displayed plenty of authoritarian and fascist tendencies himself, decide not to host that page any longer, this document will be updated.

fake news,liberal,Why do we always have to pretend as though we win every time we start to lose?,"These past few years I can't stand watching liberal and left-wing news or news content creators. By no means have I come anywhere close to giving up or falling for right-wing conspiratorial to outright false talking points, but I can't stand it anymore. I watch MSNBC and the reactions are always the same. Either shock that Trump or his supporters said something, smugness over right wing hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance, or stern scolding to people who aren't watching. And then we act and treat this as a win when Trump supporters don't care. They never will because they already believe that every negative thing about him is fake, if he does do anything he said he wouldn't do it's the right choice or a ploy, and that if what he said doesn't work-out he was misled or sabotage. We act like we haven't been dealing with these people for years. Trump and his supports will never accept a loss even as they are eating the rotten discarded remains.

Even when we do win it's not like they care anyways. I just saw a video about how Trump said the egg prices would go down before he even took office (because of course he is the darn tootenist gosh golly thing to touch the economy since overspeculation, buying on margin, and high variable interest rates) and while I care that eggs are still expensive, I stopped listening to Trumps boasting a long time ago. Trump supporters are still blaming Biden, and they'll continue blame him and other democrats as long as they possibly can. We act like people aren't treating us as villains for cutting out trump supporting family members and friends even though they'll pretend that their crowd has never done that. I can't be brought to care if you cut trump supporters out, by all means it might make your life better, but we act like it's only been a good thing for liberals and democrats. 

I talk to Trump supporters, both in my family and workplace. They haven't ""fallen besides themselves"" since Matt Gaetz withdrew, they see it as either an operation to remove democratic/rhino opposition to Trump's next appointee or as Gaetz willingly and nobly stepping to the side so that the ""Democrat psy-op"" and ""Forged accusations"" won't distract from Trump's next term. We know that handing them the receipts won't convince them because they will have forgotten to read. When they do happen to get a win, we default to talking about our wins that they don't care about, and it just comes across as though we're living in a fantasy land. It's like we're trying to emulate them but somehow missed the point of why they behave like they do.

I don't want us to give up and admit defeat. I just want us to stop pretending as though every little thing that happens is a win.  ",34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gyvcys/why_do_we_always_have_to_pretend_as_though_we_win/,1732466881.0,1gyvcys
fake news,liberal,I work in Voting Machine/Voter Security and these are my thoughts on the recent Voter ID laws and restrictions.,"Hello All,

I work with voting machine security as well as auditing procedures related to ballot security and compliance with constitutional, state, and federal regulations on voting. I want to state right away that there are things I simply cannot talk about, as such, if anyone has questions my answers will all be based on information that is a matter of public record.

In any case, I wanted to talk about the recent issues related to Voter ID laws in multiple states and just share my opinion.

First off, any political issue of relevance has to be precipitated by a crisis. Regardless of what you believe on the issue. For example, abortion is seen by pro-life activists as murder of people which is a crisis. I don't necessarily agree with that, but its clear that to them this is a crisis. For the recent string of Voter ID laws, there is no crisis. There is no loud call on either party by the American people to strengthen Voter ID legislation. To be clear, some group may have existed prior to this, but it was roughly as noticeable as the activists who believe that we should not use machines to count votes which doesn't really count^[1]. So what does this mean? To me it means that this was a crisis created artificially for political purposes. Probably to marginalize a perceived section of the population. This is proven in the following passage from Wikipedia which is well cited and confirmed:
>In 2007, a report prepared by the staff of the federal Election Assistance Commission found that, among experts, ""there is widespread but not unanimous agreement that there is little polling place fraud"". The report was based on research conducted by Job Serebov, Republican elections lawyer, and Tova Wang, voting expert from the Century Foundation. The final version released to the public, however, stated that there was ""a great deal of debate on the pervasiveness of fraud.""

Feel free to see for yourself here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_ID_laws_in_the_United_States

In theory, there is nothing wrong with requiring an ID to vote. The ID is provided to you assuming that you are eligible to vote and serves to make sure that you are who you claim you are. However, I've always been of the opinion that if something is not a problem, then it should not be regulated. If people are not committing voter fraud then why regulate it? To be clear, I do believe that the government, with sufficient representation and oversight of the people should be capable of regulating anything in agreement with basic human rights, but why regulate something that is not inherently broken? The financial industry is broken, several the people in charge of their Industry Self-Regulation boards have been convicted of fraud and were in charge of massive Ponzi schemes. See Bernia Madoff. That should be regulated to some extent, but why place further regulations on voting if there is little to no voter fraud?

For a while, I was on the fence regarding voter ID regulation. From strictly a cybersecurity point of view, Voter IDs are great. Just as a security concept it is always good to identify people as this helps protect the whole group from fraud and if implemented properly it should protect their privacy as well (there's a lot of room for misinterpretation there so here is an example: you want an account and password on facebook that identify you to make sure that you are the only accessing your info). Identification as a policy has a lot of room for error and misuse as people can be identified and unfairly discriminated against or spied on which is why it is so important that identification of any kind is implemented properly with both security and ethical concerns in mind. In voting this is important in that when you vote, no one should be able to say that they are you, and at the same time, ballots have to be anonymous so that no one, not even the gov't can figure out who you voted for. This also prevents the selling of votes as the buyer can never be sure how you voted and this is also why its illegal to post pictures of your ballot showing how you voted on facebook and the like.

But then North Carolina happened...^[2] holy crap on a cracker. Fine, from a security point of view I can understand Voter ID requirements, if you are worried about that, that's great, but why in the world would you *ever* try to get rid of flexibility in voting? And that's really what it comes down to. They are actually making democracy **harder**... They decreased the time for early voting, they increased the waiting time for voter registration before elections, and they defunded efforts to get people to register to vote. I will say this only once, and I hope someone hears me: **Democracy will only work with greater participation of people in government**. We should **NEVER** be making it harder for people to exercise their rights beyond what inherently protects society and even then we should always err on the side of caution and vastly prefer to side with rights more than restrictions. We are a government of the people, for the people and by the people. Any alternative, and apparently one the Republicans have as their goal, will lead to an olegarchy or something even worse. Why would you ever decrease the time for early voting? What is the concern? That people will have more time to vote?!?!?! That's point! Why would you ever require 60 days before an election to register? Registration takes nanoseconds on a computer and maybe a day to check against the DMV database that you are who you say you are. Another day to confirm you're not a felon. What is the concern? Please enlighten me! As someone who works with voter security, I can, with certainty, say from a professional point of view that there is absolutely **no** security reason to do any of those things and I dare them to prove me wrong. Hell, people should be able to vote for a whole month, not just a single day. If it increases voter participation by 1% its completely worthit. We are a democratic country and our system will only work if we participate in it. Any attempt to prevent us from doing so is a red flag against the likes of which the NSA spying allegations pale in comparison.




[1] - In case you are one of these people, I will say this to you now: Yes, voting machines can be hacked, I've done it, but we've designed human procedures to make sure that doesn't happen and my lab actually runs the audits on these machines and to date these procedures have been remarkably successful even when using machines of questionable quality. The fact of the matter is that people are **many** times worse at counting than machines. An experiment was conducted where a precise, but large number of ballots was determined. Then we got a team of people to use the best hand-count procedure today, with multiple cross-checks and we told their ""team lead"" a fake count number and instructed her to recount until they get that number of votes. They recounted incorrectly several times before they got the *exact* number we told them which was incorrect, and another few times before they got the actual number. The margin of error on machines is limited to people not marking their ballots properly (i.e. using a pencil and making a small mark of circling the candidate instead of filling in the bubble).

based,news,2022 Midterm Elections Megathread (plus important information),"We know a lot of you are very concerned about the US election, and frankly we are too. There's a lot of disinformation worming its way around online, and we are doing our best to fight it here in /r/news. Below you'll find a lot of important information to help you navigate voting and watching the results come in.

&nbsp;

## Your Voting Rights on Election Day

1. The FBI [is warning](https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1589241399039463424) that people may try to scam you or lie to you about the date of the election or your polling place. **Today, Tuesday, November 8 is Election Day.** You can look up your polling place [here.](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/)

2. Many states require some form of identification to vote in person. And the laws in your state may have changed in recent years. Make sure to [check your local election rules](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect) so you know what identification may be required.

3. If the polls close while you are waiting in line to vote, REMAIN IN LINE. The polling location must let you vote if you were already in line before the polls closed. 

4. If you voted by mail, you can [track your ballot here.](https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/how-do-i-track-my-ballot-details-for-every-state/) 

5. You have the right to vote in private and without being intimidated. If you experience voter intimidation, let a poll worker know and then report it to the Election Protection Hotline (1-866-OUR-VOTE) or the US Department of Justice voting rights hotline (1-800-253-3931). You should also contact your state board of elections. 

Not sure what voter intimidation is? [The ACLU has a good explainer here.](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_pdf_file/kyr-voterintimidation-v03.pdf)


&nbsp;

##Here's a quick FAQ to help you understand the 2022 midterm elections in the United States:


* **When will we get results?**

> Experts are predicting that it could take a few days to get the final unofficial vote tallies in some states. [FiveThirtyEight has a good breakdown here.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/when-election-results-2022/) 

> The biggest reason for the expected delay in results this year is due to mail-in ballots - including ballots from military service members - which some states are not allowed to start counting until the polls close. For example, Pennsylvania does not start processing their mail-in ballots until Election Day, even if they've received them in advance. 

> In especially close races, the delays could be longer because it could come down to just a handful of votes. 

&nbsp;

* **But all the ballots should be counted on election night!**

> FALSE. On election night, experts make projections based on statistical probabilities with the data they have. It is normal for it to take weeks to count all the votes. The good news is that most states are optimistic that they can have the unofficial vote count available within the first 72 hours. 

&nbsp;

* **Okay - but counting votes after election night will steal the election!**

> FALSE. Mail in ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day, and many states require that they must be received by Election Day. States have to count all votes. Counting all the votes cast isn't ""stealing"" anything: it's making sure that every vote is counted, just like every other election.

&nbsp;

* **What's this ""red mirage"" I keep hearing about?**

> A ""red mirage"" is expected in some states where election day votes are counted first. This is because election day voters tend to skew Republican, while early voting and mail-in-ballots tend to skew Democrat. This means that a state, like Pennsylvania, will count those Election Day votes first, which will make it appear like the Republican candidates have a massive lead. 

> However, as election workers start counting those mail-in-ballots, the Democratic candidates will start gaining ground. This is expected. It's not fraud. It's just the votes being counted. 

&nbsp;

* **What about the ""blue mirage""? I've also heard that phrase floating around.**

> Unlike Pennsylvania, Arizona begins counting votes as they are received. This means that early votes and mail-in-ballots will already be in the process of being counted on Election Day, and when polls close, it will look like the Democratic candidates have a lead. 

> As the night goes on, you should expect to see Republicans make up ground and you'll see a ""red shift"".  

> This is why counting all the votes is not a partisan endeavor. 

&nbsp;

* **Okay, so which states will have a ""red mirage"" or a ""blue mirage""?**

CNN has done a good job of [laying all this out](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/blue-shift-red-mirage-2022-election-results/index.html) and explaining the mirages and shifts we might see this year. But here's a cheat sheet for you:

> **Pennsylvania**: Likely red to blue

> **Arizona**: Likely blue to red

> **Georgia**: Likely red to blue

> **Nevada**: Unclear

> **Wisconsin**: Likely red to blue

> **Michigan**: Likely red to blue

&nbsp;

* **Are mail-in ballots rife with fraud?**

> No. Mail-in ballots are very secure and they are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots [since the Civil War](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/debate-over-mail-voting-dates-back-civil-war-180976091/), and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail. In 2020, it rose to 46%, largely due to the pandemic. [Here's a handy chart showing how votes have been cast since 1992.](https://imgur.com/QFk3T6L)

> Colorado is almost completely vote by mail and has some of the [most secure elections](https://www.rmpbs.org/blogs/news/experts-colorados-elections-system-is-the-gold-standard-nationally/) in the country. Check out this helpful vote by mail resource from the [Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/false-narrative-vote-mail-fraud). Heck, Ivanka and Jared even [voted by mail](https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1320775685514772480) in the 2020 election.

&nbsp;

* **Are Democrats/Republicans/Aliens/Bigfoot trying to steal the election?**

> No. Counting the votes is not stealing the election. Americans cast their votes and now we must wait for them all to be counted. 

&nbsp; 

* **Where can I find the official election results?**

> The only official results are those certified by state elections officials. While the media can make projections based on ballots counted versus outstanding, state election officials are the authorities. So if you’re not sure about a victory claim you’re seeing in the media or from candidates, check back with the local officials. The National Association of Secretaries of States lets you look up state election officials [here.](https://www.nass.org/initiatives/trustedinfo)


&nbsp;

##Help us stop disinformation

We have a zero-tolerance policy for election disinformation. 

Please report comments that:

* Claim that mail-in ballots are fraudulent.

* Claim that the election is being stolen.

* Claim that a candidate has won an election before the results have been officially called.

* Call for violence or try to organize for violent action.

by Brandon J Raub on Friday, November 11, 2011 at 10:00am

America has lost itself.  We have lost who we truly are.  This is the land of the free and the home of the brave.  This is the land of Thomas Jefferson.  This is the land of Benjamin Franklin.  This is the land of Fredrick Douglas.  This is the land of Smedley Butler.  This is the land John F. Kennedy.  This is the land of Martin Luther King.  This is the land where the cowboy wins.  This is the land where you can start from the bottom and get to the top.  This is the land where regardless of you race and ethnicity you can suceed and build a better life for you and your family.  This is the land where every race coexists peacefully.  This is the land where justice wins.  This is the land where liberty dwells. This is the land where freedom reigns.  This is the land where we help the poor, and people help eachother.  This is land where people beat racism.

 

The federal reserve is wrong.  They have designed a system based off of gread and fear.  They designed a system to crush the middle class between taxes and inflation.  This is wrong, and it is unjust.  It is wrong.

 

We have allowed ourselves to be devieced and seduced by the powers of the printing press.  It is not a good system.  It discourages saving: the foundation for all stable economic activity.  The federal reserve is artificially manipulating interests rates and creating phony economic data.  This thing has decieved our entire nation.

 

They created it 1913.  They also created the income tax in 1913.  They encouraged the growth of debt so they can tax you on it.  There is interest on the debt.  Your government is in bed with these people.  They want to enslave you to the government so that they can control every aspect of your lives.  It is an empire based on lies.  They operate of greed and fear.

 

There is a better way.  It's called freedom.  Freedom is called a lot of things.  But there is a true meaning.  It means very simply that you have the right to do whatever you want as long as you are not infringing on the feedoms of other people.

 

I firmly believe that God set America apart from the other nations of the world.  He saved a place where people could come to to escape bad systems of goverment.  This system we have created works.  It really works.

 

There is evil going on all around the world.  The United States was meant to lead the charge against injustice, but through our example not our force.  People do not respond to having liberty and freedom forced on them.

 

Men and Women follow courage.  They follow leadership, and courage.  Our example has paved the way for people all around the world to change their forms of goverment.

 

Force is not the way because liberty is a powerful concept.  The idea that men can govern themselves is the basis for every just form of government. 

 

We can govern ourselves.  We do not need to be governed by men who want to install a one world banking system.  These men have machine hearts.  Machine and unnatural hearts.  They have blocked out the possibility of a better world.  They fear human progress.  They have monopolies on everything.

 

This life can be free and beautiful.  There are enough resources on this earth to support the world's population.  There are enough resources on this earth to feed everyone.  There is enough land for everyone to own their own land and farm, and produce their own energy.

 

These people have been hiding technology.  There are ways to create power easily.  There is technology that can provide free cheap power for everyone.  There are farming techniques that can feed the entire world.

 

They are controlling your media.  They have dumbed you down through your school systems.  They have systematically dismantled the constitution.  It is in rags.

 

The bill of rights is being systematically dismantled.  Men have spilled their blood for those rights.

 

Your sons and daughters, your brothers and sisters, and Americas best young men and women are loosing their limbs.  They are loosing their lives.  They are loosing the hearts.  They do not know why they are fighting.  They are killing.  And they do not know why.

 

They have done some extroadinary acts.  Their deeds go before them.  But these wars are lies.  They are lies.  They decieved our entire nation with terrorism.  They have gotten us to hand them our rights.  Our Rights!  Men died for those rights!

 

September Eleventh was an inside job.  They blew up a third building in broad daylight.  Building 7.

 

Your leaders betrayed you.

 

You elected an aristocracy.  They are beholden to special interests.  They were brainwashed through the Council on Foreign Relations.  Your leaders are planning to merge the United States into a one world banking system.  They want to put computer chips in you.

 

These men have evil hearts.  They have tricked you into supporting corporate facism.  We gave them the keys to our country.  We were not vigilant with our republic.

That coronavirus death rate, which is lower than earlier estimates, takes into account potentially milder cases that often go undiagnosed -- but it's still far higher than the 0.1% of people who are killed by the flu. When undetected infections aren't taken into account, the Lancet study found that the coronavirus death rate was 1.38%, which is more consistent with earlier reports.

MYT is GMT/UTC + 8.

Keep in mind that there are lots of stories going around right now, and the updates you see here are posted only after I've verified them with reputable news sources. For example, stories about phones ringing are because of the phones going to voicemail or call forwarding - they are not actually the passengers' phones themselves ringing. To my knowledge, none of the passengers' phones have been reported as active or responsive.

**UPDATE 5:21 PM UTC**: White House Press Secretary says NTSB, FAA officials have arrived in Malaysia; still not enough information to know cause of plane's disappearance.

**UPDATE 4:06 PM UTC**: China to adjust search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight over expanded range and involve more ships in rescue work, state news agency says. [Source](https://twitter.com/XHNews)

>Malaysia Airlines has become aware of the allegations being made against First Officer, Fariq Ab Hamid which we take very seriously. We are shocked by these allegations.

>We have not been able to confirm the validity of the pictures and videos of the alleged incident. As you are aware, we are in the midst of a crisis, and we do not want our attention to be diverted.

>We also urge the media and general public to respect the privacy of the families of our colleagues and passengers. It has been a difficult time for them.

>The welfare of both the crew and passenger’s families remain our focus. At the same time, the security and safety of our passengers is of the utmost importance to us.

**UPDATE 1:03 PM UTC**: Relatives of Chinese passengers on board missing the flight have refused to accept money from Malaysia Airlines as distrust and frustration at the carrier mounted, AFP reports.
The airline said it had offered “financial assistance” of 31,000 yuan (£3,040) to the family of each missing traveller.
But a relative of one of the passengers, from east China’s Shandong province, told AFP: “We’re not really interested in the money.” 

**UPDATE 10:35 AM UTC**: Interpol has revealed the names of two Iranians who boarded flight MH370 on the stolen passports.Interpol’s chief Ronald Noble named one as Pouri Nour Mohammadi who was born on 30 April 1995. The other was Delavar Syed Mohammad Reza born 21 September 1984.
He later added that he was inclined to thing the disappearance of the plane was not a terrorist incident. [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2014/mar/11/malaysia-airlines-mh370-search-refocused-on-malacca-straits-live-updates#block-531ee41ce4b025518d900a60)

**TWELFTH MEDIA STATEMENT, 5:29 PM MYT/9:29 AM UTC**:

> This statement is in reference to the many queries on the alleged five (5) passengers who checked-in but did not board MH370 on 8 March 2014 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing despite having valid tickets to travel.

> Malaysia Airlines wishes to clarify that there were four (4) passengers who had valid booking to travel on flight MH370, 8 March 2014, but did not show up to check-in for the flight.

> As such, the issue of off-loading unaccompanied baggage did not arise, as the said four passengers did not check in for the flight. Hence, the above claim is untrue.

**03:00 pm MYT / 07:00 am GMT - PRESS CONFERENCE**

* No confirmation of any findings of debris
* Passenger using stolen Austrian passport has been identified as 19 year old Iranian, Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehdad. He's a asylum seeker heading to Frankfurt to see his mother. It's ""not likely"" they were involved with terrorist organisation.

**ELEVENTH MEDIA STATEMENT, 11:15 AM MYT/3:15 AM UTC**:

>As we enter into Day 4, the aircraft is yet to be found. 

>The search and rescue teams have expanded the scope beyond the flight path. The focus now is on the West Peninsular of Malaysia at the Straits of Malacca. The authorities are looking at a possibility of an attempt made by MH370 to turn back to Subang. All angles are being looked at. We are not ruling out any possibilities.

>The last known position of MH370 before it disappeared off the radar was 065515 North (longitude) and 1033443 East (latitude).

>The mission is aided by various countries namely Australia, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines and the United States of America. The assets deployed to cover the search and rescue is expensive. In total there are nine aircraft and 24 vessels deployed on this mission.

>Apart from the search in the sea, search on land in between these areas is also conducted.

>The search and rescue teams have analysed debris and oil slick found in the waters. It is confirmed that it does not belong to MH370.

>The B777-200 aircraft that operated MH370 underwent maintenance 10 days before this particular flight on 6 March 2014. The next check is due on 19 June 2014. The maintenance was conducted at the KLIA hangar and there were no issues on the health of the aircraft.

>The aircraft was delivered to Malaysia Airlines in 2002 and have since recorded 53,465.21 hours with a total of 7525 cycles. All Malaysia Airlines aircraft are equipped with continuous data monitoring system called the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) which transmits data automatically. Nevertheless, there were no distress calls and no information was relayed.

>Malaysia Airlines has a special task force to take care of families. Mercy Malaysia and Tzu Chi and others are also helping Malaysia Airlines by providing special psychological counseling to families and also the MH crew.

>The Chinese government officials in Malaysia are also working closely with Malaysia Airlines. A representative from the embassy is stationed at the Emergency Operations Centre to assist with the emergency management and matters related to families in Kuala Lumpur.

>In Beijing, the Prime Minister’s special envoy to China, Tan Sri Ong Ka Ting is there to assist and coordinate all operational matters with Malaysia Airlines.

> We regret and empathise with the families and we will do whatever we can to ensure that all basic needs, comfort, psychological support are delivered. We are as anxious as the families to know the status of their loved ones.

> To the families of the crew on-board MH370, we share your pain and anxiety. They are of the MAS family and we are deeply affected by this unfortunate incident.

12:32: Had an [email](http://d.pr/i/GMTd) from CU Denver Police forwarded to me. Originally timestamped July 20, 2012 11:41 AM MDT.

    Many of you have noticed the increased police on campus as a result of the tragic movie theater
    shooting. Our thoughts are focused the patients and the families who have lost loved ones.
 
    The alleged shooter involved, James Holmes, spent time as a graduate student at the Anschutz
    Medical Campus. He voluntarily left in June 2012, his building access was then terminated and he
    was in the process of completing withdrawal paperwork. He is currently in police custody and we do
    not believe he has been on campus since mid-June. While at this point the University Police have no
    to reason to believe that our students or staff are at risk, out of an abundance of caution, we are
    asking all non-essential campus personnel in RC-1 North and South, and RC 2 to leave the campus
    and/or not report to work. Our police have walked the buildings and believe that there is no reason to
    be concerned. However, we have specially-trained dogs that will be arriving shortly to add another
    level of assurance.

based,politicaldiscussion,Should the United States bail out Argentina?,"Trump currently plans to bailout Argentina with a $20 billion credit swap.  His motives seem perverse as he regularly pointed to Argentina and President Milei's ultra right-wing policies as a model for which the United States should follow; therefore, Argentina failing economically would make Trump look like a bad judge of economic policy.  

It has also been reported that our current treasury secretary has ties to billionaire Rob Citrone, who began heavily investing in the success of the Argentinean economy when Milei first entered office 2023. Is it possible that this is a coincidence?

This news has particularly upset us soybean farmers who are currently struggling because while normally they would be exporting their product to China, Trump's economic policies have made it so that China is acquiring their soy from Argentina instead. 

Some like David Frum in *The Atlantic* have expressed positive views of the news, saying:.

>The plan is unpopular with Republicans and Democrats alike. Yet at a time when much of U.S. policy seems driven by a perverse hostility to the outside world, assistance to Argentina is a welcome exception that deserves support across the political spectrum.

He does not explicitly explain his point of view except to say that it would be like if the Trump administration was acting like a "" normal American government"". 

However, for the most part currently the plan seems unpopular with both parties, especially because it seems to be happening for self-serving and corrupt purposes. 

Many are upset because it's been continuously emphasized that ""America is broke' and thus the federal workforce and bureaucracy has been hacked and slashed significantly, as well as a large reduction in spending on safety net programs, aid to Ukraine, and many other areas. 

Yet we have 20 billion available for Argentina. It also seems to go against Trump's America First rhetoric— President Trump has even said that we need to ""Make Argentina great again.""


1. Are there any positives to bailing out Argentina, regardless of whether or not it is being done for self-serving purposes? Legitimate benefits for the United States and its citizens?

2. What are the potential repercussions?

3.  Given that the plan seems unpopular with both parties, will this issue Trump's approval among his own base? Recent polls have indicated that his support on the individual issues and among his party or at the lowest point in his second term. Will this continue to push his approval downward?

4. Is there a chance he chickens out?",112,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nvqgtr/should_the_united_states_bail_out_argentina/,1759368051.0,1nvqgtr
based,politicaldiscussion,Is America an idea or a heritage?,"Recently JD Vance talked about in his speech at the Claremont institute about how America is a heritage.

“If you think about it, identifying America just with agreeing with the principles, let’s say, of the Declaration of Independence, that’s a definition that is way overinclusive and underinclusive at the same time,” the vice president said, taking aim at traditional American creedal nationalism. “What do I mean by that? Well, first of all, it would include hundreds of millions, maybe billions of foreign citizens who agree with the principles of the Declaration of Independence. Must we admit all of them tomorrow? If you follow that logic of America as a purely creedal nation, America purely as an idea, that is where it would lead you.

That answer would also reject a lot of people that the A.D.L. would label as domestic extremists even those very Americans had their ancestors fight in the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. I think the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong”

Now, the vice president did not completely exclude immigrants, but he conditioned his acceptance of new citizens on their gratitude, condemning those who would criticize the United States as ungrateful. To make this point, Vance went after Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City.

""Today is July 5th, 2025, which means, as all of you know, that yesterday we celebrated the 249th anniversary of the birth of our nation, Now, the person who wishes to lead our largest city had, according to multiple media reports, never once publicly mentioned America's Independence Day in earnest. But when he did so this year, this is what he said, and this is an actual quote.""

""America is beautiful, contradictory, unfinished. I am proud of our country, even as we constantly strive to make it better.""

“There is no gratitude in those words. No sense of owing something to this land and the people who turned its wilderness into the

Zoran Mamdani’s father fled Uganda when the tyrant Idi Amin decided to ethnically cleanse his nation’s Indian population. Mamdani’s family fled violent racial hatred only for him to come to this country, a country built by people he never knew, overflowing with generosity to his family, offering a haven from the kind of violent ethnic conflict that is commonplace in world history, but it is not commonplace here, and he dares on our 249th anniversary to congratulate it by paying homage to its incompleteness and to its, as he calls it, contradiction.

I wonder, has he ever read the letters from boy soldiers in the Union Army to parents and sweethearts that they’d never see again? Has he ever visited the gravesite of a loved one who gave their life to build the kind of society where his family can escape racial theft and racial violence? Has he ever looked in the mirror and recognized that he might not be alive were it not for the generosity of a country he dares to insult on its most sacred day? Who the hell does he think that he is?”

While what Vance says is theoretically true, it also means he think Mamdani doesn’t have the right to criticize the US system even though he has to take the oath to the same constitution and go through the legal process to become a citizen. Does this extend to someone who is say a second generation immigrant. Are they allowed to be ungrateful if they couldn’t be here without the generosity of the US?

Or is the US is a creedal nation? While I don’t know if I can make a good argument, I can refer to Abraham Lincoln.

Here’s what he said on July 10, 1858, in a speech on “popular sovereignty,” the Scott ruling and the expansion of slavery.

“””We have besides these men — descended by blood from our ancestors — among us perhaps half our people who are not descendants at all of these men, they are men who have come from Europe — German, Irish, French and Scandinavian — men that have come from Europe themselves or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here, finding themselves our equals in all things. If they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood, they find they have none, they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us, but when they look through that old Declaration of Independence, they find that those old men say that “we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,” and then they feel that that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are. That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.”””

I think it is under this assumption, that everyone who becomes a US citizen has a direct heritage back to our founding fathers, that Lincoln and the Republicans signed birthright citizenship and the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments into law.

So is the US a creedal nation or based on blood and soil?

Not about MAGA or Anti-MAGA. I would like to have a discussion about the government as a whole and how it has changed from the original intent and is this a good thing or not.

The Founding fathers had very specific concepts on the way they felt the government should run, designing each branch with fundamental responsibilities and limitation. One of the primary issues I have with the current view of the constitution and government is that we have three equal branches. That is not how it was designed or intended to be viewed. Congress is almighty, the executive is secondary and the judicial is minimal.

# 1. Legislative Branch – Congress

The Founding Fathers believed the legislative branch should be the most powerful and central component of the federal government. Created under Article I of the Constitution, Congress was charged with making the laws that govern the nation. This included the power to tax, regulate commerce, declare war, and control the national budget. The Founders designed Congress to be the closest branch to the people, with members of the House elected directly by citizens and Senators originally chosen by state legislatures. They intended this branch to be deliberative and slow moving, using debate and compromise to produce well considered laws. By splitting it into two chambers, the House and the Senate, they sought to balance popular influence with institutional stability. As James Madison put it in *Federalist No. 51*, in a republic, the legislative authority “necessarily predominates,” meaning the Founders saw Congress as the proper place for major national decisions to be debated and decided. The founders never imagined a congress that was politically deadlocked and so unwilling to compromise that legislation .

# 2. Executive Branch – The President

The executive branch, described in Article II of the Constitution, was meant to enforce the laws passed by Congress, not create them. The Founders feared concentrated power, especially anything resembling monarchy, so they designed a presidency that would be strong enough to act decisively in emergencies, but constrained by law and oversight. The president was granted powers like commanding the military, negotiating treaties (with Senate approval), vetoing legislation, and appointing federal officials. But these powers were limited and conditional, with Congress holding the authority to override vetoes, control funding, and even remove the president through impeachment. The Founders envisioned the president as a unifying, energetic figurehead who could respond swiftly to national needs while remaining accountable to the Constitution and subordinate to the legislative branch. The role was meant to be administrative, not legislative or judicial in nature. Executive Orders were originally intended for rare but needed situation that could be used in emergencies and handling of executive needs.

# 3. Judicial Branch – The Courts

The judicial branch, established in Article III, was intended to be the weakest of the three branches, possessing neither “the sword” of the executive nor “the purse” of the legislature, as Alexander Hamilton wrote in *Federalist No. 78*. Its core function was to interpret the laws and resolve disputes under them. The Founders gave federal judges lifetime appointments to insulate them from political pressure, ensuring they could decide cases based on legal principles rather than popular opinion. However, the judiciary was not originally imagined as a major check on the presidency or the legislature; rather, its role was to settle conflicts and clarify what the law said. Over time, the courts have taken on a more assertive role in checking the other branches, but at the founding, they were designed to be cautious, apolitical arbiters of justice. The judiciary created it's own power of judicial review and having authority over Congress and the Executive in 1803 in Marbury v. Madison, the Constitution does not give this power.

# In Summary

The Founders built a system where **Congress makes the laws**, the **president enforces them**, and the **courts interpret them**. Their aim was to prevent the concentration of power in any one branch, preserving liberty through a system of checks and balances. While they expected disputes and overlap, they believed that if each branch remained within its constitutional limits, the republic would remain strong and free.

So my questions are:

Do you think the Founding Fathers view was correct?

Do you think we should revert to the original intent or take on a more moderate view?

based,politicaldiscussion,In his second term Donald Trump has targeted research and universities. They make for a soft target because they receive large sums of grant money from the federal government and vote largely for the Democratic party. What is a similar soft target in the Republican party?,"If, for example, a Democrat won the 2028 election and prioritized targeting Republican voters and donors, what industries, areas, careers or groups would make a similar soft target?

These groups would ideally be vulnerable to action by the federal government laws and funding changes and largely aligned with the Republican party.

What laws would the hypothetical Democrats pass and what executive orders would they sign to target this group?

For example, I've seen people suggest car dealerships as an example. They represent a major electoral and financial base and are greatly helped by states banning direct car sales to consumers. 

Laws preempting state bans on such sales would force dealerships to compete and taxes placed on parts sold at these dealerships could cause much damage without having the broader electoral backlash that say, targeting oil and gas could have  may have in the form of higher gas prices. Furthermore, dealerships are not popular with the American public and may not inspire much public protest.

Sure, Trump acted pretty much solo to do this, but it's remarkable that non-US entities are targeting a subset of the country's economy based on politics. I can't remember another time in the last 30 or so years when a world leader has been seen as an aggressor but the response was targeted precisely at their support base. For instance Duterte led his country and the response was different, said to be Magnitsky-like. [ICHRP](https://ichrp.net/ichrp-announces-dirty-dozen-magnitsky-sanctions-campaign-against-philippine-human-rights-violators/) In the United States, the Magnitsky act reduced the property and travel rights of specific individuals as anti-corruption and anti-human-rights-abuse measures, as these people were said to park money and make safe comfortable bolt-holes to run away to so they could be insulated from risks associated with being oligarchs, if ever the winds should change against them.

Are these targeted trade war measures aimed to harm Republican voters?

Are these  targeted measures aimed to protect Democrat voters?

Are the biggest exports from Democrat-led regions more difficult to target because the alternatives are worse or the price can't be as easily borne?

Why would anyone respond this way? If the responses achieved their purpose exactly as intended, what would the world look like?

Economic analysis surrounding potential policy changes related to electric vehicles was presented by Harvard University's Salata Institute in a March article titled ""[Quantifying Trump's Impacts on EV Adoption](https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/quantifying-trumps-impacts-on-ev-adoption/)"".

The results of the various scenarios that they model vary significantly, depending on the agressiveness of the Trump Administration's efforts. While the current administration could trim billions off of federal expenditures, it would result in spiked emission levels.

In Februrary, Kiplinger, an American publisher that releases personal finance advice released an article titled ""[Is Trump Taking the EV Tax Credit Away? What You Need to Know](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/whats-happening-with-the-ev-tax-credit)"" The article presents the argument of those who believe the credits should be endedthat while the credits may have helped to jumpstart the market, government intervention shouldn't continue. Their assertion is that if EVs, as their proponents contend, are superior and cost-effective, they should be able to compete.

based,politicaldiscussion,Why do white supremacists have so much freedom in the United States?,"In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution protects free speech almost absolutely, allowing white supremacist groups, neo-Nazis and other far-right organizations to demonstrate publicly without government intervention, as long as they do not directly incite violence. Why has this legal protection allowed events such as the Right-wing Unity March in Charlottesville in 2017, where neo-Nazis and white nationalists paraded with torches chanting slogans such as 'Jews will not replace us,' to take place without prior restrictions? How is it possible that in multiple U.S. cities, demonstrations by groups like the Ku Klux Klan or the neo-Nazi militia Patriot Front are allowed, while in countries like Germany, where Nazism had its origins, hate speech, including the swastika and the Nazi salute, has been banned?

Throughout history, the U.S. has protected these expressions even when they generate social tension and violence, as happened in the 1970s with the Nazi Party of America case in Skokie, Illinois, where the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the right of neo-Nazis to march in a community of Holocaust survivors. Why does U.S. law not prevent the display of symbols such as the swastika, the Confederate flag, or the Nazi-inspired 'Sonnenrad' (sun wheel), despite being linked to hate crimes? What role do factors such as lobbying by far-right groups, the influence of political sectors that minimize the problem of white supremacism, and inconsistent enforcement of hate crime laws play in this permissiveness?

In addition, FBI ([2022](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics-2022)) ([2023](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-violent-crime-decreased-2023-hate-crimes-rose-fbi-reports-2024-09-23/)) studies have pointed to an increase in white supremacist group activity and an increase in hate crimes in recent years. Why, despite intelligence agencies warning that right-wing extremism represents one of the main threats of domestic terrorism, do these groups continue to operate with relative impunity? What responsibility do digital platforms have in spreading supremacist ideologies and radicalizing new members? To what extent does the First Amendment protect speech that advocates racial discrimination and violence, and where should the line be drawn between free speech and hate speech?

College educated people and young men have also shifted to the right. They didn’t all go for Trump overall but they still shifted to the right compared to previous years. 

Cities and their suburbs, traditionally Democratic strongholds, have begun voting more Republican too. This could be important as rural America is shrinking quickly and more people are flocking to urban and suburban areas. By 2050, 89% of the American population is projected to live in urban/suburban areas, up from 83% right now. I think these are things that could shape what the Republican Party becomes in the future and what their priorities are.

The archetype of a Republican voter has traditionally been an older white person from a rural area. But as time goes on, this could change.

We don’t know if these changes are only for 2024 or if it’s a broader trend that will be more permanent. Since these groups may become a bigger part of the Republican electorate, how do you think this will affect the future of conservative politics in the United States if it kept going this direction? Would this curb the influence of far right extremist groups like White nationalists?

Also, despite the increased racial diversity, two groups that shifted further away from Republicans were women and the LGBTQ community, so it will be interesting to see how that develops. I wonder if the divide will shift from race to more about sexuality

By its nature, partisanship often creates an “us vs. them” mentality, where people view opposing ideas not as opportunities for dialogue but as threats to their own beliefs. This mindset hinders collaboration and creates division, making it difficult to address the complex issues our nation faces today.

For a country as diverse and multifaceted as the United States, is it realistic—or even beneficial—to align strictly with one side of the political spectrum? Can we find ways to value compromise and shared goals without abandoning our principles?

In leadership, for example, it’s possible to respect someone’s achievements or policies even if we don’t agree with their rhetoric or personal values. This perspective challenges the idea that political affiliation defines the entirety of someone’s worth as a leader. When we judge based solely on party lines, we may miss opportunities to learn from or work with individuals who could otherwise contribute to progress.

The question then becomes: how do we, as individuals and as a nation, move beyond rigid partisanship? What steps can we take to create a more open-minded and collaborative political environment?

While I’m not saying he will fire that many, I do have many questions about the possible firings. 

	1.	Wouldn’t adding so many people to the unemployment rolls be a significant issue? Has anyone considered the impact on local businesses—shops, restaurants, coffee shops, and other services—that rely on these federal employees as customers? The job losses could extend far beyond the federal workforce as many countries saw during the pandemic shutdowns and work from home.
	2.	What happens to these people when they lose their health insurance and livelihoods? Does the administration have a plan to offset this? Does the US have an unemployment insurance program?
	3.	Who will perform these jobs and deliver the services that Americans rely on? Will everything grind to a halt? Or will these be positions that are really unnecessary?

based,politicaldiscussion,Can true meritocracy work?,"The question has two parts.

Part A: Is it actually possible?

Is the idea of meritocracy really possible, or is it a utopia only in paper? Note that meritocracy differs significantly from socialism, since socialism/marxism provides equality for everyone, regardless of their wealth or talent. But meritocracy favors talent over wealth. It agrees with socialism on disregard for inherited wealth, but argues people should be given opportunities based on their ""merit"", which is talent, intelligence, or even beauty. I believe the idea is romanticized in many cyberpunk settings, such as Metropolis (1927) and The Matrix (1999); dystopian societies where rich people are rewarded and poor, talented people are discriminated. It criticizes both capitalism and marxism.

Problem 1: Who determines who's worthy and who's not? Government? Corporates? And who chooses them?

Problem 2: What defines ""merit""? What is the standard of being intelligent/talented?

Problem 3: How can we make sure corruption does not happen, and reach true meritocracy?

Problem 4: Should genetic traits such as intelligence, strength, and beauty only be rewarded, or acquired traits such as hard work should be too?

Part B: If it's possible, is it a good thing?

Let's say somehow, we get close to the idea of true meritocracy. But is this a good thing for a society? If you're good in something, you'll be rewarded. But people with average intelligence/capability will have many challenges. Maybe we can work on giving the ""average"" citizen a descent, livable life; but even then, is it moral?

Pros:

based,politicaldiscussion,"How open are you to the possibility that your political beliefs could be wrong or unpopular? If that could be proven, how would that change your political behavior?","In 2010, Matt Yglesias coined the term ""the Pundit's Fallacy"" to describe ""the belief that what a politician needs to do to improve his or her political standing is do what the pundit wants substantively"".

Ever since the election, the Pundit's Fallacy seems to have entirely taken over the discourse as the Democrats as a party try to figure out what to do next. As the full extent of the data from the election has yet to be examined and given shape yet for the public to consider, many people are clinging to whatever incomplete data they have to make the argument that the Democrats lost because they failed to embrace... whatever said pundit's existing beliefs about politics were. Moderates have been pointing to the unpopular social positions the Democrats as a party are associated with and advocating for more strident repudiations of them. Liberals point to the wave of anti-incumbency that has swept the world this year, or to the role of voters' media diets influencing their perceptions of the economy and policy toward negativity, or to Harris only having around 100 days to take over the campaign after Biden stepped down. Leftists point to the party not taking a stronger stance on the war in Gaza, or the perception that the party moved to the Right by embracing the Cheneys as campaign surrogates, or not having more ambitious Left-wing policy plans all costing the campaign support. The thing is, there is _some_ amount of evidence for all of these positions, some stronger and some weaker than others, and therefore the discourse is drowning in pundits with absolute confidence that that means their position is correct and that the key to success is to do what they already wanted us to do. 

But what if it isn't? In politics there are very few definitive answers one way or another. We calibrate our beliefs based on our biases, our morality, our understanding of reality, our understanding of our communities, our experiences, but those are all subject to flaws in human psychology. Polls can be wrong, manipulated, gamed to produce a specific answer. Studies can be politically motivated, biased or the evidence could actually be much weaker than presented. Echo chambers can create the impression that a belief is more widespread than it actually is. Things we consider to be common sense can have blind spots from our own personal ignorance. It is easier to grapple with cognitive dissonance by rejecting evidence that we don't like than integrating it into our understanding.

Whatever your beliefs are- about the election, about the support for the UHC CEO assassination and the public's opinions on private vs public health insurance, about trans people in sports and trans healthcare, about whether your party needs to moderate their beliefs or become more extreme, about whatever issues you strongly care about- how sure are you that they are true? What if there was some kind of irrefutable evidence handed down from an omniscient divine source that could definitively refute it? How would that change your political strategy to learn that a political position you hold was just factually wrong, or that your political beliefs that you fight for are an extreme minority?",35,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1hdhima/how_open_are_you_to_the_possibility_that_your/,1734111233.0,1hdhima
based,politicaldiscussion,Trump won on a wave of dissatisfaction with the government and a desire for change.   How can democrats restore that faith and what changes should they propose?,"There have been many conversations about why Harris lost.  However, one of the most compelling ones I’ve found is that Trump was an antiestablishment candidate who promised change against a system that is extremely unpopular.  Democrats were left defending institutions that are unpopular and failed to convince the working class and the majority of Americans that they are on their side.  Democrats never gave the American public the idea of what a new reformed government could look like under Harris.  Trumps cabinet picks have primarily been focused on outsides and victims of the systems that they intend to run.  It’s clear that the appeal here is that Gabbard/RFK/Musk is going to clear out all the unpopular bureaucracy, inefficiencies and poor management of these institutions.  For the most part, Americans are receptive of this message.  Trump was elected by the plurality of the vote.  Musk, RFK, and Rogan all have strong bases of support for being non conventional.  Poll after poll voters have expressed extreme desire for significant change. 

After listening to Ezra Kleins latest podcast, they aren’t exactly wrong.  Americans don’t trust democrats or the government in power.  California and New York are the two most populous blue states that have the highest amount of people leaving.  People see how projects like a speed rail has wasted billions of dollars and nothing to show for it after decades.  They see how it cost $2 million dollars just to build a toilet.  Despite these two states being economic and societal powerhouses, there’s a reason that people are leaving that politicians are missing.  

But it’s not just at the state level.  Federal projects end up taking literally years due to the momentous amount of hoops and bureaucracy.  Despite the CHIPS act being passed over 2 years ago, most of the money still hasn’t been spent because of just how inefficient it’s being handled.  Simple things like investing in EVs end up being a confusing mixture of requirements bot h for consumers and companies that constantly moves on a yearly basis.  

I used to think that M4A struggled to gain momentum because of the cost but it’s clear to me now that the hesitation that people have towards it is that they simply do not trust the government to run a system effectively or efficiently.  Thats another reason why gun restrictions may be popular but rarely are motivating because people do not trust the government to enact that laws.  I recall people talking about a government funded childcare and people are immediately worried about all the strings and bureaucracy that comes with it.  It’s a very common joke that anything the government does will be done poorly and take twice as long.  Even when the child tax credit wasn’t renewed because people didnt care enough.  

If people are so dissatisfied with the government and the status quo, why should democrats expect voters to give them more power?  So what can democrats do to restore the faith of the American public in government?  How can democrats make it take a year to rebuild a bridge, like the I95 collapse, instead of a decade?  What changes should democrats propose to make it clear that government is working for them and if not, can be held accountable?  What can democratic governors do to prevent the mass exodus from their states?",252,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gyyiga/trump_won_on_a_wave_of_dissatisfaction_with_the/,1732474762.0,1gyyiga

[With undocumented immigrants even committing less crime than legal immigrants.](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/undocumented-immigrant-offending-rate-lower-us-born-citizen-rate)

While I broadly understand that media fearmongering and the GOP political machine has an incentive to convince the public to be anti-immigration, and will fuel moot points even if they're not backed by statistics, but why hasn't the statistical truth broken through this threshold? 

Immigration was 2# in voters issues and why they voted for Trump instead of Harris. Even a large number of Latino voters, a community that are overwhelmingly immigrant related, voted for Trump for this same reason.  While its understandable that immigrants also have the mentality of ""deport criminals, keep the hard working ones"" just as Americans do, the fact that a large portion of the populace associates high immigration with high crime is still unexplainable to me.

And also; how much of this is the fault of Harris' campaign oversight? As well as DNC negligence. Similar to the economy, we have a situation here where statistics and data shows that immigration and the economy are doing good, but unlike the economy, immigration crime doesn't at all affect most Americans, there's just a perception that isn't even truly there. The Harris campaign could've flagshipped ""immigrants commit less crimes than citizens, also they're good for reducing inflation"", yet didn't. So how are these numbers of the positives of immigration not at all mainstream? 

People are still espouting myths of immigration crime and their impacts of the economy, I'm shocked that numbers-based facts haven't been shown to the public to say ""hey guys, we hear you, but all of your concerns would be fixed if we legalized them and taxed them more. I PROMISE you guys, immigrants are not increasing crime in this country, the FBI has the numbers to back this up."" This should've been the flagship and the Harris Campaign could've equally spent time educating the public about the truth of immigration. Yet that didn't seem to be the case.

So I have to ask: why aren't these facts commonplace? For what reason is it that the DNC never articulated and lead with immigration statistics when convincing the public that immigration is not the problem?

**Edit:** Several people without reading this post are trying to correct me by saying ""illegal immigrants commit more crimes, pundits are referring to illegal immigrants when they talk about the high immigration crime.""

based,politicaldiscussion,What are your thoughts on a purge of senior military by the incoming Trump administration?,"On the prospect of a purge of top generals and admirals by the incoming Trump administration, to ensure personal loyalty to him....

This matter has been debated frequently on Reddit. However, I have some niche experience in this realm, having helped maintain Wikipedia's articles listing [four-star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_duty_United_States_four-star_officers) (admirals and generals) and [three-star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_duty_United_States_three-star_officers) (vice admirals and lieutenant generals) officers in the United States military since late 2020.

Military officer appointment procedures stem from the [Defense Officer Personnel Management Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Officer_Personnel_Management_Act) (DOPMA), passed in 1980, and are codified in Title 10 of the [United States Code](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/&edition=prelim). When the Armed Services committees pass their yearly defense authorisation bill, any changes demanded of the military consist of updates to Title 10. Officers are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

While the military is *supposed* to be apolitical, senior officers can, and have been, removed at the President's pleasure. After all, ultimately, *the President decides who they want to work with, and senior officers are vetted partially on how well they could work with the commander in chief.* Recent removals have occurred when the individual expresses open disagreement with the commander in chief, makes severe public gaffes, or are unlucky enough to commit professional incompetence ([Moseley 2008](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-undoing-of-gen-t-mich_b_238432), [McChrystal 2010](https://www.bbc.com/news/10395402), [Mattis 2013](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/01/18/the-obama-administrations-inexplicable-mishandling-of-marine-gen-james-mattis-2/)). Since the main duty of senior officers outside command is to present honest military advice to the commander-in-chief, and to Congress, relieving them before the end of their assignments is unexpected and risks the wrath of their retired colleagues and their supporters in Congress.

Before I enter my initial opinions for discussion, here are some stats (accurate as of 9 November 2024). Of the four-star officers currently on active duty (44 in total):

1. **9** are African-American (including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs [CQ Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Q._Brown_Jr), the principal military advisor to the President).
2. **6** were initially promoted to four-star general or admiral under the Trump administration (one, [GEN LaCamera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_LaCamera), is retiring with a Senate-confirmed successor already in place).
3. **3** are women, all initially appointed by the Biden administration, and the first woman appointed to each of their roles, received a lot of publicity ([ADMs Franchetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Franchetti), [Fagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_L._Fagan), and [Levine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Levine)).
4. **1** serves in a non-military political office that can hold the rank of admiral in the Public Health Service if desired ([ADM Levine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Levine), the first openly transgender person to hold the rank of admiral).

Here is what I surmise based on my personal experience, and what other articles have already stated:

* The incoming administration will target generals and admirals too closely identified with their predecessor's DEI initiatives. Here are the most likely departures:
   * ADM Levine, who isn't technically military, serves in a political role (Assistant Secretary for Health) and only holds military rank to outrank the [three-star surgeon general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Murthy), is easily the first one out.
   * Gen Brown, [chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff). [George Floyd](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/charlesqbrownongeorgefloydcivilunrest.htm) (iykyk). The chairman of the Joint Chiefs served a 2-year term by law, typically renewed once by the President with Senate confirmation, until it was changed in 2017 to an uninterrupted 4-year term. Brown may simply be relieved prematurely at his 2-year halfway mark, October 2025.
   * ADM Franchetti, the first woman to be [chief of naval operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Naval_Operations) (head of the Navy). Her selection as the CNO was highly publicized, following the 2021 promotions of [GEN Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_J._Richardson), [Gen Van Ovost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Van_Ovost), and ADM Fagan (Richardson and Van Ovost have retired). However, the President made the call to [choose Franchetti](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lisa-franchetti-nominated-first-woman-navy-joint-chiefs-of-staff/), [overruling the DOD's pick](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/12/paparo-franchetti-austin-navy-00101594), thus giving the incoming administration a possible opening.
* For those worrying about blatantly ""Trumpist"" generals being appointed, I don't see that happening without a sudden culture shift in the military. Not soon, anyway.
   * For starters, the tradition that the military stay out of partisan politics is sacrosanct. I haven't seen any  recent cases where an active duty military officer (including [LTG Mike Flynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Flynn)) paraded around any partisan leanings. While the military's values typically lean traditional Republican, open loyalty to a President typically shows only after retirement.
   * If the President-elect is serious about appointing ""loyal"" officers to senior military roles, he'll have to comb the lower ranks. [Title 10, Section 601](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/601) of the U.S. Code stipulates that only one-star officers and above can be promoted to general or admiral, so the maximum he could do is promote colonels and Navy captains to one-star ranks and begin choosing from there.
   * On the ""culture shift"", open, public loyalty to a President from the upper military brass (the kind we likely worry about) will only show once the practice becomes either legally acceptable or murky enough on paper to no longer be important.
   * To dismiss disloyal officers and comb the lower ranks for desired ones will likely require a special commission to investigate. The military officers and DOD professionals (smth smth [Schedule F](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/trumps-schedule-f-plan-explained/)) in charge of vetting prospective senior officers for the secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, JCS chairman, Secretary of Defense and President would have no clue on how to select based on the ""loyalty"" the President-elect desires.
* The President, and allied defense advisors, may try to replace DOPMA or loosen its requirements so officers from lower ranks can be promoted faster to reach the upper brass, or increase the maximum retirement age of 64 to keep favoured officers for as long as possible (not unheard of - [the DOD under Rumsfeld tried to increase it to 72](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=mUqr4c4-VXMC&pg=PA1491&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)). Senate confirmation will remain part of the process, but a pliant majority until at least 2027 should make it a breeze.

r/Military focuses on topics like military pay, veterans' benefits, the state of military barracks, and on the political side, how the incoming administration will affect the willingness of the rank-and-file to continue military service. This community often provides more analytical insights, so I look forward to it.

Once again, this matter has been debated frequently in other areas on Reddit, but I hope I've provided additional insight so productive responses are forthcoming. Maybe there's cause for concern, maybe there isn't - i.e. only a few officers will see termination. We won't know until he takes office. What do you think?

P.S. Sorry if I sound abrasive in this post. I've been described as having a stiff and formal manner of speaking.

P.P.S. The military being used for partisan purposes with a purge of senior officers is inherently a political matter. The jargon-heavy nature of this post hopefully doesn't change that.

P.P.P.S. If this question looks partisan in any way whatsoever, I apologise and am welcome to receive comments on how I can reword portions to be less disparaging in nature.

based,politicaldiscussion,"In a scenario where neither candidate gets to 270 electoral votes, and Harris wins the contingent election in the House of Representatives, if Republicans controlled the Senate, who would they choose for Vice President?","Some background--under the US constitution, if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes in a presidential election (270), the house of representatives chooses the President in a ""contingent election"" where each state gets one vote (decided based on a majority of that state's delegation).  The vice president is chosen by a simple majority vote of the Senate.

While this isn't a likely scenario in 2024, I do think it is within the realm of ""reasonable possibility"" satisfying rule 5.  Here is a somewhat realistic example map getting to 269-269:  [https://www.270towin.com/maps/vDemb](https://www.270towin.com/maps/vDemb) There's another variation where Rs win everything they won last time, plus PA and MI but Dems win everything else that also gets to the same result.

Importantly, the selection of the president and VP under this scenario would be done by the incoming (newly elected) Congress, not this one.  So it's possible either party could control one or both branches, but to me the most interesting scenario is a split and the most likely one is where Dems control sufficient delegations in the House to choose Harris for President, but Republicans control the Senate and therefore can choose the VP.  

My question is, if this happened, who do you think Republicans would choose for VP and why?  One obvious answer is to pick Vance since he is, after all, the party's VP nominee.  But I imagine there might be pressure from the base to choose Trump since he's the one they want as close to the presidency as possible in case something were to happen to Harris.  Or would they choose someone completely different?

based,politicaldiscussion,"Can the Harris Campaign Change the ""Open Borders"" Narrative with Recent Border Crossing Data?","TL,DR: Illegal border crossings are currently *lower* than they were in the last few months of the Trump presidency. Will that change anybody's mind about the border narrative?

The Trump campaign has been hammering the Biden-Harris administration on what they call an ""open border"" problem, especially at the southern border of the United States. This narrative has been a central talking point for Trump and his supporters, used to rally their base with claims of unchecked illegal immigration.

However, the data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection tells a different story. Over the past five to six months, we've seen a steady decline in the number of apprehensions at the southern border. For instance, preliminary data for July 2024 (as reported by CBS) shows approximately 56,000 encounters, a significant drop compared to the numbers in the last months of the Trump presidency. To put this in perspective, in November 2020, the waning months of the Trump administration, there were about 70,000 apprehensions.

That said, it's important to acknowledge three key points:

First, this decline in numbers is a recent development. The numbers spiked in the middle of the Biden presidency.

Second, while apprehension numbers give us some insight, they are ultimately just a proxy for the actual number of illegal border crossings. There's no way to know the true numbers under either administration, so we're working with estimates based on the best available data.

Third, illegal border crossings ultimately are influenced by many geopolitical factors that are completely out of the control of the sitting US president.

Despite these nuances, the Trump campaign continues to push the ""open borders"" narrative and places the blame solely on Biden/Harris. This raises an interesting question as we head into the election season: 

**Can the Harris campaign effectively use this data to counter the narrative, or have Trump voters (and independent voters) already made up their minds?**

Will they simply dismiss the recent data, claiming it's either inaccurate, a temporary dip, or irrelevant to the broader issue? Or is there potential for this information to shift the conversation and challenge the effectiveness of Trump's messaging on this front?

I’m curious to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think the declining numbers can change the narrative, or is the ""open borders"" claim too deeply ingrained at this point?",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1el6xa9/can_the_harris_campaign_change_the_open_borders/,1722912770.0,1el6xa9

Proposition 22 was passed by California voters on general election night in November 2020 with 58.63% support on 80.67% turnout. Gig companies Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, InstaCart, and Postmates spent combined $200 million supporting the measure.

While the measure guarantees some benefits such as health care stipends and accident insurance, it excludes gig drivers in California from full employee benefits such as the state minimum wage, full workers' compensation, employer health insurance, sick leave, vacation time, overtime, and unemployment insurance.

While the appeal courts already ruled last year that this measure is constitutional, it seems that the California Supreme Court agreed to take up this case just to make a point that California voters have just as much constitutional rights as their state government in Sacramento to directly enact laws including those related to workers' compensation.

While labor activists and unions have condemned this decision, the gig drivers are divided since the measure getting overturned would have reshaped the gig economy in California. The gig companies welcomed the decision and will continue to operate as usual.

The state of Washington passed a similar law in 2022 classifying gig drivers as independent contractors but it was much more generous in terms of benefits and protections.

globalist,politicaldiscussion,Ted Cruz AND Marco Rubio not eligible to become President?,"Series of posts I found interesting by /u/Drooperdoo:

According to Cuban law, any child of a Cuban national is considered by Cuba a Cuban citizen upon birth. Even if the child is born on foreign soil. (Cuba does NOT recognize US citizenship or Canadian citizenship.)
In other words, the media has been dishonest: Ted Cruz wasn't just born with two citizenships; he was actually born with three. At birth, he was an automatic citizen of the US, Canada--and Cuba.

The problem with that?

The Founding Fathers banned dual citizenship. (It wasn't legal in the US until 1967.) Why did they ban it? Because they didn't like the idea of divided loyalties. The Constitution is a nationalist document; not a globalist one. They explicitly placed in the ""natural born citizen"" provision to exclude dual citizens.

Though Cruz's surrogates have rushed around claiming that ""natural born citizen"" merely means someone with American citizenship and that the issue is vague, the facts don't align with their assertions. A ""natural born citizen"" is not someone with one American parent. To meet the threshold, BOTH of your parents have to be American. Plus, you have to be born on US soil.

The founders got the phrase ""natural born citizen"" from a French work, entitled The Laws of Nations by Emmerich de Vattel. In this book (which everyone at the Continental Congress read), de Vattel writes: ""Natural-born citizens, are those born in the country, of parents who are citizens.”

Why ""parents"" and not parent?

Because if you had a non-citizen parent, you'd be eligible for dual citizenship elsewhere (hence susceptible to divided loyalties).

It gets harder and harder to listen to the propaganda from the globalist media that the Founding Fathers had Ted Cruz [with 3 different citizenships] in mind when they put that provision in the Constitution. If they believed in dual citizenship, why did they ban it? If they wanted dual citizens to be eligible for the presidency, why did they explicitly place in the ""natural-born citizen"" provision to prevent it? Remember: The Constitution doesn't merely call for a President to be a citizen; it calls for him to be of the higher threshold of a natural-born citizen. They didn't put in those extra words merely because they liked to hear themselves talk. Citizen and Natural-Born Citizen are NOT synonyms--as the Cruz camp keeps dishonestly alleging.

Footnote: http://havana.usembassy.gov/service.html Quote: ""The Government of Cuba does not recognize the U.S. nationality of U.S. citizens who are Cuban-born or are the children of Cuban parents. These individuals will be treated solely as Cuban citizens"".


Question: Cruz was born in 1970 when dual citizenship was legal. He's no natural born citizen by any stretch though.



Response: The Constitution wasn't written in 1970.
Let's repeat this so there's no misunderstanding: No one is arguing whether Ted Cruz has US citizenship [as one of his three different citizenships]. No one is trying to deny him residence in the United States.
But being a citizen (after 1967) doesn't make you magically eligible to run for President.

The Constitution still calls for the President to be a natural-born citizen. Not a mere citizen.
Until that provision is stricken from the Constitution, it stands.

So any 1967 ruling on allowing dual citizenship does NOT invalidate the natural-born citizen requirement in the Constitution.

All it means is that Ted Cruz would be allowed citizenship through his mother [whereas the Founding Fathers would NOT have extended him such citizenship]. When they wrote the document, you were a citizen of where you were born. Since Cruz was born in Calgary, Canada, the Founders would have considered him unambiguously a Canadian [hence a British subject under Commonwealth law].

The ""natural-born citizen"" provision was placed in the Constitution explicitly as a safety-mechanism to keep British subjects out of the most powerful position in America.

I hate to say it, but when the document was written they specifically had people like Ted Cruz in mind.
But the Cruz people keep pushing on: deleting the first half of the term ""natural-born"" citizen. It's as dishonest as the open borders advocates conflating ""immigrant"" and ""illegal immigrant"".
""Well, if we delete the first part of the phrase, hopefully people will confuse the two groups!""
Whenever Ted Cruz (or Marco Rubio's) citizenship problems arise, their surrogates keep repeating ""Citizen . . . citizen . . . citizen . . ."" studiously careful not to allow that ""natural-born"" part of the phrase to enter into the debate.

Footnote: Marco Rubio, too, is not a natural-born citizen, under the US Constitution. Though born on US soil, neither of Rubio's parents were American citizens at the time. And, like Cruz, he was born a dual citizen, with solid Cuban citizenship (under international law). Dual citizens are NOT ""natural-born citizens"".

globalist,politicaldiscussion,Let's Discuss the Trans Pacific Partnership,"What is the Trans-Pacific Partnership?

""The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a proposed regional regulatory and investment treaty. As of 2014 twelve countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region have participated in negotiations on the TPP: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam."" [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership)



I think the TPP is a topic worth discussing because it's an opportunity for the left and the right to come together to oppose something that only serves corporate interents. Robert Reich recently wrote an article discussing this [topic](http://robertreich.org/post/84984296635), ""Populists on the right and left are also coming together around six principles:... 6. Oppose trade agreements crafted by big corporations. Two decades ago Democrats and Republicans enacted the North American Free Trade Agreement. Since then populists in both parties have mounted increasing opposition to such agreements. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, drafted in secret by a handful of major corporations, is facing so strong a backlash from both Democrats and tea party Republicans that it’s nearly dead. “The Tea Party movement does not support the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” says Judson Philips, president of Tea Party Nation. “Special interest and big corporations are being given a seat at the table” while average Americans are excluded. Left and right-wing populists remain deeply divided over the role of government. Even so, the major fault line in American politics seems to be shifting, from Democrat versus Republican, to populist versus establishment — those who think the game is rigged versus those who do the rigging."" 

I've collected sources from both sides of political spectrum so we can consider their criticisms. I'll also link to the [Wikileaks](https://wikileaks.org/tpp/) page, so you can actually read the contents that have been leaked. 

1. [teaparty.org](http://www.teaparty.org/obama-negotiating-away-u-s-sovereignty-secret-37755/) 
>A leak regarding the TTIP revealed a proposed “Regulatory Cooperation Council” that would evaluate existing regulations in the U.S. and EU. In addition, it would recommend future rules while coordinating a response to the current regulations. Foreign policy analyst Andrew Erwin, writing for the left-leaning the Nation magazine said the TTIP was less about reducing tariffs and “more about weakening the power of average citizens to defend themselves against corporate labor and environmental abuses.” It was a particular section in the TTIP called the Investor-State Dispute Settlement which Erwin took issue with. That section stipulates that foreign corporations can use a special international tribunal to sue the government instead of using the country’s own domestic system that uses U.S. law.

2. [Public Citizen](http://www.citizen.org/TPP)
>The TPP would even elevate individual foreign firms to equal status with sovereign nations, empowering them to privately enforce new rights and privileges, provided by the pact, by dragging governments to foreign tribunals to challenge public interest policies that they claim frustrate their expectations. The tribunals would be authorized to order taxpayer compensation to the foreign corporations for the ""expected future profits"" they surmise would be inhibited by the challenged policies.

woke,politicaldiscussion,The Colonial era,"Many people think 1776 was the beginning of America or have a vague understanding of the first 200 years that preceded. I find it interesting each colony was unique with its own kind of government, charter, proprietorship, and even endorsed Christian denomination.

Wars were nothing new though. Natives were struggling to reclaim their land too through several waves, the land we took. They were having their own revolution, but unfortunately history swung in the other way. 

So part of this here is to lay out the struggles The Colonies had even before but also to ask a question of the experts.

British rule kept demanding more resources. At what point did residents start to feel 'occupied' ? What did British occupation actually mean then? Was it like a 'woke' phenomenon? Obviously it got to a point people experienced the burden of taxation and then the brutalities and it just escalated from there where revolution was justified.

Second question, how were the legislative bodies in The Colonies able to coordinate so effectively together? They became the First Continental Congress, but what actually inspired them to start coming together as the precursor to becoming The United States? Was it really usage of the press with propaganda (like certain patriotic symbols)? Lack of resources?

Is a call for dissolving the United States and secession grounds for action in today's Congress?

Congress formally established the Homeland Security Committee as a standing committee in 2005 to ensure that the American people were protected from terrorist attacks. The committee focuses on legislation and oversight related to the security of the United States.

Marjorie Taylor-Greene was previously [removed](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/17/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-paul-gosar-committee-assignments/index.html) from all committees under the Democratic House in the 117th Congress.  She was granted a Homeland Security committee spot under the Republican House in the 118th Congress. 

For context, Marjorie Taylor Greene's previous removal was largely based on comments she made before becoming a Representative.  These include:

* a campaign ad where she shot and killed feral hogs, after referring to Democrats as an infestation of feral hogs allowed to roam free and destroy the American countryside
* calls to execute then House Speaker Pelosi
* liking Facebook comments that said the quickest solution to removing Pelosi would be ""a bullet to the head""

It seems like once or twice a month Saudi Arabia hits the headlines with another horrible violation of basic human rights, and today's headline about an Islamic Scholar who says its ""okay"" to have sex with female *slaves* and received Saudi Arabia's *highest Honor* is really getting me close to the tipping point.

I cannot stand how close the U.S. Government is with the Saudi government. It's disgusting and, frankly, embarrassing. How can the United States be allies with such a nation? They're almost on the level of North Korea for gods sake. I understand supporting a stable and friendly trade partner in the Middle East, but does the government have to send them aid and political support, not to mention hundreds of M1 Abrams tanks (the best tank in the world)?! The United States should be ideologically opposed to their entire government, yet they're as close to us as Israel, and maybe even closer.

I don't understand how our presidents can even pretend to support them. The Saudi family is evil and I would smile if I woke up one day to see them all dead. The people of that land are horribly oppressed and both Liberals and Conservatives should be against such a powerful and awful government. Not to mention, the President should not respect the death of a tyrant or accept the coming of power of a new one.

It seems to me like on the plus side there'll be positive (at least in my perception) change with regard to the environment, foreign policy, Wall St. reform and health care.

1. That doesn't mean there won't still be corporations. They're accustomed to government being a buzzing fly at the very worst, and a faithful servant most other times. If corporations are suddenly at odds with the government, they will be pissed. I don't know how they will retaliate, but they will.

2. A corruption-free democracy doesn't mean a unified party of compassionate, Dove-ish Keynesians. Voters still have the same biases they had before. Frankly I don't know what this non-corrupt elected government's partisan makeup would be at all.

3. Freeing ourselves of corporate gridlock over any reformist bill in congress, or unfavorable move by the president would mean the government would be free to, for instance, raise the minimum wage to $15/hr. Great, except the subsequent inflation would break the economy for a while while things balanced out. (Not to mention more of that Wall St. retaliation) How will reforms like this get rolled out?

4. The Tea Party nightmare of a bureaucratic nightmare of left wing special interest superseding the public interest isn't TOTAL bullshit.

traitor,politicaldiscussion,"Bowe Bergdahl: Deserter, Traitor, Proxy or Red Herring?","The political fervor of the Bowe Bergdahl - ""Taliban Five"" continues to reach a fevered pitch.  The republicans have galvanized in their assertion that the president's actions are both unconstitutional and criminal (to be fair, debatable).  The democrats have taken to in-fighting and split support of the Commander in Chief.  The endless ""news"" cycle of our esteemed broadcast giants continues to stir the pot.  

My questions is why?   What is the ulterior motive to harp on what amounts to nothing more than political theatre?  Why are our elected leaders being consumed with a topic, that once stripped of emotions, is pretty cut and dry?

Let's examine the facts that WE (the American Public) are privy to:

- Bowe Bergdahl was and currently is a member of the American Military Force. 

- Bowe Bergdahl has been held captive by the Taliban (an enemy of the state) 

That is the sum of what we know.  Everything else is merely conjecture, speculation or worse, uninformed opinion.

We brought one of ours home...isn't that the defining principle of the military.  ""Leave none behind"".  The questionable efforts to bring other americans (military or not) in captivity home, does not change, diminish or make unjust the efforts to bring Sgt. Bergdahl home.  Suffering or not, deserter or patriot, one, five or ten taliban top guns...why is this of consequence?

I ask this, because I fear the worst.  That political theatre will continue to reign over political substance.  That our nations military, continue to be sacrificed, not for the protection of liberty, freedom of the democratic way...but for preserving political office.  That (r) or (d) next ones names, means less about political affiliation and more about a compromise of values, ethos, common sense and true patriotism.   That the election cycle and staying on message, is far more important than what is right.

I fear that with each passing day, as our personal liberties are eroded and our fear/insecurities preyed upon...that what is left our democratic experiment collapses, while we stand idly by.

If Sgt Bergdahl is a deserter... he will face the consequences.

If Sgt Bergdahl is a traitor... he will face possible execution.

There is no if about this...Sgt Bergdahl is coming home.  That, at any cost, is still a small victory for the American people...politicians be damned.

Bowe Bergdahl is a proxy...for why being a patriot, being an American in today's farce of a political climate is a greater responsibility than ever before.

I hope that somehow we rise to the occasion... because, for damn sure, our elected leaders won't.

traitor,politicaldiscussion,Snowden and Patriotism,"In the wake of the NSA scandal, it's easy to forget that as citizens of the United States, we should want our government to have secrets. An American who is more patriot than ""citizen of the world"" must oppose the revelation of classified information because American power in the world is reliant on secrecy. We are less valuable to allies and less fearsome to enemies if our military and intelligence capabilities are known.

Every President or Prime Minister would like the people of his country to be patriotic and the people everywhere else not to be. If we all loved America as much as Donald Trump claimed to, we'd sure be rich. Gates and Buffett would give their money to kids in Chicago and Appalachia instead of Africa and the Middle East. Thankfully, for the children half a world away who suffer from AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, Bill Gates is not a patriot. A patriotic man thinks the suffering of foreigners is less important than the suffering of his countrymen. An enlightened man does not. A good man does not.

Last week, in a comfortable room in Moscow, Edward Snowden, the most infamous leaker of U.S. secrets of all time, told NBC anchor Brian Williams that he thought of himself as a patriot. If the motivation for his actions was patriotism, he must have been profoundly naive about U.S. politics. Otherwise he would have realized that the Supreme Court in 1972 and the Church Committee in 1975 and President Ford in 1976--all 3 branches of government in 4 years--tried to rein in the overreach of intelligence gathering and failed. The breadth of U.S. surveillance has only grown. The U.S. Senators and Presidents who promise transparency and easing of our intelligence operations are the same ones who were briefed on the contents of Bin Laden's computer.

Maybe Snowden was aware of the inefficacy of the previous attempts to restrict U.S. intelligence gathering, but in his patriotic fervor believed that the suite of documents he could bring to the American public would be enough to finally exhort change and strengthen the nation. But that sounds awfully foolish for a man shrewd enough to be branded a traitor and still capture American hearts.

All the evidence suggests that Snowden knew that his revelations would weaken the United States, at least in the short term and medium term. His leaked documents eroded the trust our allies had in us and gave our enemies reason to rally against us.

Who is Edward Snowden, then? Traitor? hero? His crime was telling 6 billion people the ways in which the most powerful intelligence community in the most powerful country in the world, which happened to be his own, was spying on all the citizens of the world.

Or are we stuck with the kangaroo court which Obama and Clapper are assembling which will conclude that of course neither were ever engaged in any sort of wrongdoing. 

Clapper committed a felony by perjuring himself while testifying under oath, and his reward is to get to head up an investigation into his own agency. He is neither ""independent"" or an ""outside expert"". He is a man who perjured himself with the intent to deceive members of the intelligence committee as well as the American people. He is obviously not an ""outside expert"" because you know, he's the head of the agency which is supposedly under review.

traitor,politicaldiscussion,"Should those voting to limit/erode our constitutional rights be addressed as traitors, rather than merely ""corrupt"" or ""inept""?","A random thought that popped into my head tonight when talking about Snowden with a friend.   I know our elected officials wouldn't fit under the federal government definition for treason.  But if we have elected (or appointed from elected)officials who lets say knew about secret programs that violated our constitutional rights and then supported expanding/enforcing said programs, while possibly receiving donations from companies/entities involved.  Which would further the claim of betrayal for person gain.  Rather than claiming them as merely ""corrupt"" or ""unscrupulous"" (or the lighter ""misguided"")  Should they not be viewed as traitors to the nation for their actions?

**Edit** I do apologize, I wrote this at 3am and left some clarification out.

* 1)  I was not insinuating locking them up.  As no one has done anything that counts under the constitutional definition of Treason.
>*Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.*  Article III Section III U.S constitution.

* 2) I was more saying, should we as people view them as traitors under the standard definition.
>*One who betrays one's country, a cause, or a trust*

My motivation for this, would be not to imprison them but more to better force political change.  It's a harsh word and I think it's needed to shock our politicians into finally acknowledging our displeasure with the erosion of UN-alienable rights guaranteed to all of us and lumping law abiding Americans into categories that they feel the need to be secretively monitor.

After all I imagine most are used to being called, greedy, corrupt, and incompetent, it just rolls off their back and it's business as normal.  As the claim would be serious(even without legal ramifications) would it shock them into finally taking a step back to see their actions for how we see them.  Does anyone feel that the accusation would help the American people better in bringing to light what needs to be brought to light and perhaps even maybe force them to actually go back focusing on doing what's best for the people.

**Edit 2** No this not for politicians who people merely disagree with.  I am talking about people who go off in one direction against public opinion and when the public raises concerns or opposition, as what they are attempting to do would directly affect them and then they continue regardless not even humoring a public discussion or properly addressing concerns.

traitor,politicaldiscussion,Here is my best understanding of the Snowden scandal. Please correct me where I am mistaken.,"""Facts"":

1) Edward Snowden leaked details of several top-secret U.S. and British government mass surveillance programs to the press.

2) On June 14, 2013, U.S. federal prosecutors charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property.

3)The text of the 4th Amendment of the Bill of Rights reads as follows:The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

4) The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal freedom of information law that allows for the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased information and documents controlled by the United States government.

5) Espionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern, however the term is generally associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies primarily for military purposes.

Conclusions to be drawn:

The United States government is, in short, branding Snowden as a traitor (see facts (2) and (5)) for gathering and feeding information to the enemy. However, Snowden has only fed information to the press(to the best of our knowledge, as the background of this ongoing story has yet to lead us to believe otherwise, see fact (1)). In other words, Snowden has only fed information to the American people. 

The actions of the American Government, therefore, raises serious questions as to whom the American government views as the enemy.

On Edward Snowden:

Throughout the story as it unfolds, Snowden has consistently stated that his actions have all been for the sake of the American people. Prior to the scandal, it is said that Snowden had an annual salary of around 200k, resided in Hawaii, and had/has been dating a girl of certain acclaimed beauty. It is safe to assume that Snowden knew what the consequences of his actions would be, but was still driven to follow through. In essence, Edward Snowden knowingly gave up his life as it was described, choosing instead to live a life of exile, so that the American people may know the crimes of the American government. He has yet to find asylum, and probably knew beforehand that asylum may not ever become available. Given this background combined with the aforementioned ongoing story, it is difficult to conclude that Snowden was in fact acting against the American people, as the American government is insisting.

Should the American government capture Edward Snowden, he does not expect a fair trial.

On the NSA:
Edward Snowden firmly believes the actions of the NSA to be a clear negligence of the 4th Amendment of the Bill of Rights. Upon learning this, a number of American people sent a request of information to the NSA for exactly how far the American people's security(see fact (3)) has been breached, as such information is entitled under the FOIA(see fact (4)). So far, to the best of our knowledge as the ongoing story unfolds, all requests have been rejected.


After reviewing the above, my personal opinion is that the American government had/has been, indeed, at fault for spying on the American people without the consent thereof (see fact (3)), and is at fault further for refusing to yield crucial evidence which would either confirm or deny the crime in question. The attempts of the American government to both silence and deface Snowden further back my conclusion.

EDIT: TL;DR Edward Snowden has revealed that the American Government has been spying on the American People. People mad. Government say ""no sokay hush hush"" *whispers* ""kill Edward Snowden"". People ask, ""why kill Snowden?"". Government: ""no sokay hush hush""",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1hyg6c/here_is_my_best_understanding_of_the_snowden/,1373400043.0,1hyg6c

We have lost the freedom to choose what we feel is right for ourselves, the freedom to choose what we do with our bodies, and what we put in them. Whatever happened to separation of church and state? I believe we never had it to begin with, and at this point we still don't, or gay rights and marijuana legalization wouldn't be an issue. We are still very much a backwards country, contradicting the very constitution we were founded on, 4th amendment rights taken away in secret, 1st amendment rights taken away, and people speaking the truth having their words turned back on them in the name of espionage. Has our government forgotten what espionage means?! The American government is turning their backs on their own people, and throwing those speak out about their betrayal in jail for what they call treason, it is you America that has committed treason against your own people! On this 4th of July I do not celebrate independence, for we have lost our independence. Instead I look to the freedom we do still have, the freedom of change. We CAN stand in numbers, make the dream our fathers before us had a reality! It is up to us my fellow Americans. We have the power to put a stop to this tyranny. It is not our choice, but our right as American citizens to change the dark country we have become. As it says in our Declaration of Independence, the very document signed we are celebrating today, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security."" This rings so true today. So I say to you my brothers and sisters of the United States, do not let oppression happen. On this day when we remember freedom and the sacrifice our founders made for it, while you are grilling out, and getting drunk, I urge you to contemplate what freedom means to you.  Contemplate my words, and the words of your forefathers, and choose to fight for the rights and freedoms that not only are you entitled to, but the rights and freedoms of your fellow man, the men and women who came before you, and your future children. God bless you American citizens.

traitor,politicaldiscussion,Making the Case: Edward Snowden,"I am sure that many are tired of hearing of Edward Snowden.   Given how much media coverage there is of the situation, I wanted to make my headline clear just to warn you what my article is about.   The same man being called a traitor by some is being hailed as a hero by others.   Given the wide range of reasoning behind these viewpoints, I want to bring in to focus the case for and against Edward Snowden.

First, let's make the case for Edward Snowden.   He was hired as a contracted worker for the NSA.  Upon starting the job, he discovered that the government was overriding civil liberties and privacy laws in the name of national security.   While the government is trying to make the case that such steps are necessary, and that they have prevented terrorist attacks, the problem in that argument is that the Boston Marathon Bombers used those same online resources that were being monitored, and despite being warned about the two bombers, somehow they never managed to intercept the attack.  So if they weren't tapping into people they had been warned about, who were they tapping into?  This is a major flaw in the ""necessary for national security"" argument they are presenting.   What doesn't help is that this whole ordeal is coming on the heels of uproar about the IRS targeting certain groups, and media phone records being tapped.   Whilst the Obama administration is swearing there isn't a fire, there is a whole lot of smoke that doesn't look too good.   By all intents and purposes, Edward Snowden appears to be a whistleblower, and the only reason it appears otherwise is that the person he is blowing the whistle on is the United States Government.   For the government to charge Edward Snowden with espionage whilst they are spying on their own citizens is, as the old saying goes, the pot calling the kettle black.  

Then there's the case against Edward Snowden.  The government cannot afford to give details of what they were looking for in tapping the phone and computer records of it's own citizens.  As long as it remains unknown, potentially harmful threats to America do not know what to and what not to avoid.  They have had to remain secretive.   It was also revealed in Hong Kong that Edward Snowden went into the job looking for a way to disseminate information about the NSA.   This report would suggest that he WANTED to find information to give out.  If that was indeed his sole purpose, then there is more validity to the notion that he is a spy.  When police search warrants are issued, they have to specify what they are looking for.   If they search a house looking for drugs, they could find prostitution going on, but they cannot arrest someone for prostitution because that wasn't what they went looking for.  Essentially, an employee accepting tax dollars did not follow proper procedures to investigate the NSA.   Further damaging the case as a whistleblower is that Edward Snowden now seems to be releasing information for the purpose of protecting himself from being extradited.  

So, in my opinion, what this boils down to is how we choose to define a whistleblower.    Can a person be a protected whistleblower when they entered a situation looking for something to be wrong?  It does damage the case suggesting that Edward Snowden innocently found this material.  However, that is an unconfirmed news report:  one that may well sway how you view Edward Snowden.

traitor,politicaldiscussion,A little bit of perspective on the Edward Snowden case.,"I'm an American, and I've been very disappointed and frustrated with my fellow citizens' reaction to the ""scandal"" that has erupted because of the leaked information by a former NSA contractor. I wish very much that the U.S. Government was better at explaining exactly what NSA does, though part of the problem is it is really damn tough to explain to someone why you can't tell them something without telling them so much that it defeats the purpose of you not telling them in the first place. That is a real sticky wicket in a democracy. 

There has been quite a bit of talk of Edward Snowden as a ""traitor"", and I'm not sure that label quite fits. On the other hand, there have been plenty of people that call him a ""whistleblower"" and a ""hero"", which is probably even less true. Snowden is an IT contractor that came across something that scared him. It scared him because he didn't understand it. The truth is, if you want to assign an overly simplified classification to the man ""dumb-ass"" probably fits the bill better than anything. His mistake was that he forgot that the ability to collect something and actually collecting it is not the same thing. I suppose I can't really blame him too much, because it seems that half of America can't either. 

I ask you to simply consider the following: If you ran a signals intelligence agency, even an evil one, would you allow a password resetter from IT to task email addresses and phone numbers in your SIGINT system? This is what he is claiming he could do. He said in the taped interview that he could tap the President's phone with ease. Now, unless you subscribe to a theory that the president is merely a patsy figurehead (and I recognize that some people do think that), do you think that the head of a mass data-mining operation would allow his on comms to be collected? It isn't so much that Snowden is lying, I actually think he really believes these things are true., it is that he is a low level contractor with delusions of graduer who doesn't understand what the hell is going on amongst the collectors and analysts. 

The second point I'd like you to do, is to look at the document that he chose to (allegedly) exfiltrate from a secure facility. It's a powerpoint document. A powerpoint document. Really. Now, if you truly believed that the NSA had a covert, mass-scale data mining operation that threatened American democracy, and you were willing to give up your life to disclose that, don't you think you'd get, I don't know, a screen shot of the program itself? A directive from DIRNSA? An incriminating email from your department head? Instead, what he provided was simply a presentation that said that a certain program existed. Now, that is plenty good enough to shoot that program to shit in the blink of an eye, but where does it say that this briefing slide that this program is being used against American citizens? It doesn't, because it isn't. The NSA is a signals intelligence service that provides foreign intelligence to the U.S. Government. If ever there was a secret program to catch you looking at goat porn, you would find it in the FBI, not the NSA. 

Which brings me to my next point, and this is one that I'm absolutely shocked at the incredible naiveté of the American people. Just because a government (or corporation, person, baseball team, chess club...) has the capability to do something, does not mean that are USING THAT CAPABILITY! For example: there is a group of men in my town that could, with ease, kick down my door and murder me with their guns, and there is nothing I could do to stop them. It isn't a gang, it's the police department. I could be illegally arrested by the FBI, spied on by the CIA, shanked in the back by a crack head at the ATM. Guess what all these things have in common? They are illegal! So too would it be if the NSA was data mining everyone's computers to check up on anything that you were doing that might make you an enemy of the state (a movie which, contrary to popular belief, is not a documentary on NSA operations). 

Now, if you feel uncomfortable that all these things are true, you are not alone. I don't really like it either. The sad truth is that everything from allowing police officers to carry guns, to keeping a standing army, to creating an intelligence service that operates in secret, is a tradeoff between total personal freedom (called anarchy) and no personal freedom (authoritarianism). It is a totally legit and fair point of view to say ""hey, I just don't like that such a capability exists, maybe we shouldn't allow it"". That is totally fair. What drive me crazy (and led me to write this), is when I see people all over the place (and reddit is one of the very worst offenders here) screaming ""Oh my god, the government has an intelligence capability, we are being watched! It's a police state! Big brother is watching!"" No, the government is not watching, your computer pornography collections and on the side girlfriends are of no concern to them. Instead, their eyes are faced outward looking at the very real, and very scary threats to American (and allied) national security. This includes terrorism (which frankly I've always thought was a bit overblown, but you can thank the American people for collectively peeing their post 9/11 pants for that, but that's another story), but it also includes threats from some not so nice countries that would like very much to see very nasty things happen to the U.S. (and her allies, for all of you living in NATO land). 

That lead me to my final point. The NSA is the largest, most advanced, and best funded signals intelligence organization in the world. WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU THINK THEY WERE DOING? Seriously people, if I found out the NSA COULDN'T hack into my email, I'd be freaking pissed. Not that I want them to do it, but for the money that is spent, you'd have to be pretty damned naive to think they couldn't. 

Look people, there is ABSOLUTELY some very crucial questions to be asked about who watches the watchers and exactly what policies we want when it comes to discerning those who can be survailed upon as legitimate targets for foreign signals intelligence, but I promise you, you are not moving the ball forward on any of these questions but making ""OMGZORZ, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING"" memes, or talking about this dumb idiot Snowden as if he's fucking Ralph Nader reborn. Frankly, if more Americans started actually paying attention to these kinds of things (without shitting their pants and shrieking like teenage girls), then perhaps we could have a decent, functioning goddamn government and deal with some of the actual government abuses that exist (like the REAL scandal of warrantless wiretapping being pushed by the executive branch not ten years ago). I'm begging you reddit, please, in the name of scumbag Steve and Success Kid, for god's sake, stop beatifying this slap nuts and get back to advice animals. Or a more nuanced political debate about the role of government. That would be fine too.

traitor,politicaldiscussion,"As a man who loves his country, I cannot in good faith vote for President Obama","I am a simple man, I love my family, and I love the United States. Before I can get into why I cannot vote for the current president, I pose to you a simple question. 

What is America? America, simply put, is the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Without them, nothing separates us from an oppressive dictatorial regime. To fully get into the discussion of the Constitution and Bill of Rights would take a post as long as a book, so I will leave the subject with the hopes that you understand your basic constitutional rights. The first amendment everyone knows, freedom of speech, press, and religion. The 4th amendment not as many are familiar with. The right Of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated. Article 1 section 9 of the constitution ""No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury""

These are just a few of our rights that our founders believed were inalienable rights, belonging to every man, woman, and child.

Without these rights the government can come swoop you up in a black van in the middle of the night, and hold you indefinitely without trial and without the right to know your accusers. Essentially reverting back to feudalism where the King's word is the law.

Obama, despite being very charismatic and having the overall appearance of a likable guy; a guy you wouldn't mind having a beer with, if I may put it like that, has done more harm to our gauranteed inalienable human rights than any president in recent history, and with the exception of Roosevelts Japanese internment camps during WW2, Obama has been the biggest oppressor of liberty in the last 100 years.

If you want evidence of the trampling of liberties I am talking about, look no further than the National Defense Authorization Act that Obama signed into law. The law states that the president can label anyone he wishes with the title ""enemy combatant"" and whisk them off to jail with no judge and no jury, and he can hold you indefinitely. Obama signed this into law and absurdly promised the public that he would not use the power granted to him, and he even went so far as to say that he didn't agree with that part of the bill. 

Funny, if President Obama didn't agree with the indefinite detention of citizens, why now after a judge ruled it to be unconstitutional is he seeking to appeal that judges ruling? http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-administration-fights-for-the-ndaa-2012-9 

On a related topic, President Obama, in all of his hubris, sees nothing wrong with the targeted assassinations of United States citizens. Are you kidding me? Are we truly living in such an Orwellian world where enemies of the state can become unpersons at the presidents whim, even though they are US citizens? http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/07/killing-of-al-qaeda-cleric-awlaki-unconstitutional-suit-charges.html

Let's push on towards President Obama's list of broken promises. On the Campaign trail in 2008, Candidate Obama pledged he would get us out of Iraq within 16 months of him taking office, he pledged to close the Guantanamo Prison, and he also vowed to repeal the tyranical Patriot Act, given to us by Pres. Bush.

Fast forward to 2012, we still have troops in Iraq, as well as the more financially draining civilian contractors. Gitmo remains open to this day, (I hear they just finished renovating a soccer field) and in 2010 Obama reauthorized the Patriot Act, essentially telling us that he cares as much for our personal liberty as Bush did. 

Obama even went so far as to say that he didn't need congressional approval to attack Libya, and that ""U.N approval"" was all he needed. Either Mr. Obama has never read the constitution or he just flat out doesn't care what it says. That reminds me of a joke, what do you think is the worst thing? Is it the ignorance or the apathy? I don't know, and I don't care.

To summarize we were all deceived by a great lie that has been ransacking our liberties, and our very identity as a country. Obama promised hope and change, he turned out to be worse than Bush in terms of taking our freedoms away.

To be clear I believe that Romney will be just as big of a traitor to our liberties as Obama has been. They both have special interests circling them like vultures. Stop believing in this Left, Right paradigm reddit, I don't care how many AMA's the man has done. Wake up and take your country back. If we don't sober up from our soma holiday soon, we will have to explain to our children what it was once like to be able to protest your government, and the safety that habeus corpus once provided to us.

Rutte described the deal as really big, confirming that the weapons would be paid for by European nations, a decision the alliance's leader described as ""totally logical"". The value of the weapons amounts to billions of dollars.

Lindsay Graham has referred to the upcoming sanctions as a sledgehammer and Zelensky called them a bone crushing sanction.

patriot,politicaldiscussion,Every elected President since World War II has modified the government positions which make up their Cabinet. What further modifications (if any) should be made to the Cabinet of the President of the United States?,"The [Cabinet of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States) is a part of the Executive branch of the United States Federal Government.  Currently consisting of 23 government officials, they are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate (with the exception of the Vice President and Chief of Staff).  The Cabinet's purpose is to serve as an advisory body to the President.  Its authority is derived from Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the US Constitution.

The Cabinet currently consists of 23 members: The Vice President, the 15 heads of the Executive Departments, and 7 other officials.  The first (and smallest) Cabinet of George Washington consisted of four positions (the Secretaries of State, Treasury, War, and the Attorney General.  The Vice President was not considered a part of the cabinet until the mid 20th century.)  

The largest Presidential cabinet in US History existed from January 2017 to December 2018, with 24 Cabinet and Cabinet-level officials (Upon the resignation of Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations, President Trump demoted the position to [no longer be of Cabinet-level](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/un-ambassador-no-longer-be-cabinet-level-position-n945356)). 

While public perception often sees Cabinet and Cabinet-level positions as either unchanging or simply a growing list, the reality is that while the Cabinet currently consists of 23 positions, a total of 33 positions have, at some point in American history been of Cabinet-level rank ([Here is a graph showing the timeline of the composition of the US Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States#/media/File:Top_Left_Cabinet_Image.png)).

Since WWII, as every elected President since Truman has either added or removed at least one Cabinet or Cabinet-level position, the composition of the President's Cabinet and Cabinet-level officials have become more and more politically relevant, with discussions of what positions should make up the President's Cabinet often taking active roles in Presidential campaigns.  A notable example of this is Jimmy Carter famously promising to not appoint anyone to the Cabinet-level positions of 'Chief of Staff' and 'Counselor to the President.'  More recent examples leading into the 2020 election include: [Donald Trump proposing the consolidation of the Departments of Education and Labor](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/06/21/622189097/white-house-proposes-merging-education-and-labor-departments), [Elizabeth Warren proposing the Department of Commerce and the cabinet-level Small Business Administration being merged](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/a-plan-for-economic-patriotism-13b879f4cfc7) into a single 'Department of Economic Development,' and Andrew Yang proposing a [Department of Technology](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/regulating-ai-emerging-technologies/).

Topics for discussion:

\- What positions should (or should not) be in the President's Cabinet?  (For the sake of discussion, I am counting Cabinet-level officials as equal to the core Cabinet, although there are small bureaucratic distinctions).

\- The power and influence of the Cabinet has waxed and waned between Presidential Administrations.  How important should the Cabinet be to the President going into the future?  How much political power should the Cabinet actually have?

\- What should the ideal size of the Cabinet be?  Is there even such a thing as an ideal size of the Cabinet?",527,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/diq6kk/every_elected_president_since_world_war_ii_has/,1571236634.0,diq6kk

patriot,politicaldiscussion,Ben Carson's Exit Post/Speech (via Facebook) - Thoughts?,"I have lived a blessed life and achieved more success than I ever dreamed was possible. Running for President was never on my bucket list, and when I was drafted by a grassroots movement asking me to do so, it was not a decision that I made lightly and saw as an act of service. 

However, I believed that my values, life experience and common sense solutions put me in a position to help get our nation back on track for the sake of our children and grandchildren. This grueling endeavor would not have been worth it for any other reason.

When I began exploring a run for President as a private citizen detached from the political class, I had neither a political team nor a national network of wealthy donors standing by waiting to support me.

We had to build a grassroots campaign from scratch by reaching out to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible and through every means possible, resulting in indisputable success. This movement consistently outraised the entire Republican field, got onto every ballot and built a 50-state, bricks-and-mortar campaign infrastructure to share my story, values and solutions. It was an historic feat, and I’ll be forever grateful to my team and my incredible supporters, financial and otherwise, from all corners of America, on behalf of the best interests of the American people.

I hope my presence added a measure of civility to the race, raised issues that would not otherwise have been discussed and had an overall positive impact. While our political efforts must come to a close, gratefully, the grassroots movement that has given new voice to “We the People” and inspired millions will continue. 

I may be departing the campaign trail, but I will not be departing the scene.  Instead, for the rest of my life, I will continue to work tirelessly to do everything I can to save America for the next generation. 

I will be working on a number of initiatives, including serving as honorary chair of My Faith Votes, a non-profit organization dedicated to mobilizing the 25 million Evangelicals who didn't vote in the last election. The twin pillars of faith and family are under attack, and I will endeavor to strengthen our nation by preserving them both.

I have committed to not endorse a specific individual, but rather “We the People.” Though many today are making decisions based on fear and anger, I trust their judgment to logically examine the candidates and make the right decision by looking at:

(1) Whether they have demonstrated significant accomplishments over their lives and careers.

(2) If they have ideas that are clear and policies that are easy to find.

(3) How they treat their family and others, as that is how they will lead the country.

(4) What they have done to improve the lives of Americans;
the people they are with, what they are saying and how they collaborate with others.

(5) Their ethics, because what America needs is “Trickle-down ethics.

Conservatives should not be embarrassed by capitalism, but must couple it with compassion, to lift people out of a culture of dependency and provide ladders of opportunity for all Americans to be a part of the fabric of society.

People need to understand this is a most important election, in which we are deciding whether we allow the government to dictate our rights and take care of our needs, or whether individuals will rise up and take responsibility in an atmosphere of opportunity for all.

The bottom line is, “We the People” are the ones making the decisions; but in order to do that, we must become active and informed, not manipulated by the political classes and media.

Along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for President, I remain committed to saving America for future generations. We must not depart from our goals to restore what God and our Founders intended for this exceptional nation. 

Equally important, we need to understand that Republicans are not each others' enemies. We need to engage in conversation and challenge each others' positions, not fight each other. Conservatives need to unify together so that that we do not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and put another secular progressive in the White House.",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/490t9b/ben_carsons_exit_postspeech_via_facebook_thoughts/,1457147863.0,490t9b
patriot,politicaldiscussion,Did Snowden's actions actually lead to the deaths of American operatives like many people have said?,"This might be longwinded intro to a question but here it goes. 

When people ask me how I feel about Edward Snowden or whenever I discuss him with family members or friends I tell people the truth about how I feel: I think that his actions were necessary. I'm not gonna sit here and call him a hero like some people do, but I personally think his actions reflect a lot of what the founding fathers laid out for our nation, which is to have a government that responds well to its people. I think that part of the discussion needs to be about how there is a necessity for citizens to be able to call bullshit on their government when they feel it is infringing on their freedoms/rights while also addressing the potential negative outcomes as well, but I have always felt that a well rounded discussion has never really been had. (I've never heard one) Say what you like about him but he did reveal information about our government, and some of its agencies, that the people need to know. It should be up to the people to say how much spying our government can do on us in the name of domestic security. While I am not anywhere close to an expert on international and domestic security, it does seem to me like there are better ways to assure our safety than collecting and storing everyone's day to day activities. (And why not delete personal info after a while? Why hold on to it all like a glaring rob me sign to other nations' hackers?)


 It is safe to say that many people did not know about just how far our government was going about looking into peoples' personal info (US citizens as well as people flagged as dangerous to domestic security). This includes me, I had no idea the extent of which the NSA was collecting and storing data on your average citizen. Personally I think this has a number of implications that most people never talk about. 


And yet I always seem to get the same two counterarguments from people when I mention my opinions. One: people say,""oh if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't care about the government prying into your private affairs."" This is a ridiculous argument because it misses the entire point. The point is that if you allow the government this power, it is just the first domino in the chain of actions that inevitably lead to more infringements on US citizens' rights. Who is to say what form the Patriot Act will take in a few years. While the NSA spying programs might not surprise you, most government programs, once started rarely ever remain the size as when started. They usually grow, take on more responsibilities and demand more power and influence. The whole point of having a media, journalism, and potential whistleblowers which is to have a checking system for when we as citizens feel that our rights are being stepped on, and if you say nothing in the beginning, the problems only get worse and it is harder to stop in the future. Snowden forced America to have the discussion of the NSA and in many ways privacy in general. 


The second argument: by releasing that info, Snowden endangered the lives of US agents abroad. This is the argument I cannot refute because I do not know if it is true. I have never actually heard of actual deaths happening due to this material being taken from the NSA. It is important to note that Snowden didn't just dump all this data he stole into the void; he didn't sell it to our enemies, he handed it over to two journalists who he believed could handle such sensitive information with integrity. And from what I recall, the amount that they actually ended up releasing was an incredibly small portion of what was taken. I thought the whole purpose of choosing these two people was to prevent things like putting American agents at risk. 


Does anyone know if this is fact true? Did Snowden's files actually lead to American deaths? 


Also if people have other thoughts on Snowden feel free to add input… I'd love to hear peoples' thoughts.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3pfxpn/did_snowdens_actions_actually_lead_to_the_deaths/,1445310352.0,3pfxpn
patriot,politicaldiscussion,"A fundamental change in the Status Quo, maintaining stability of operating system-read and discuss?","Political System Model #1 Enlightened Capitalism:

A political system wherein every citizen of the country is afforded a base share-an account with an inflation adjusted sum given as a right at birth. This will serve to anchor the individual to the society by making his/her best interest society's best interest. As the economy and country do well, every citizens share will rise in value correspondingly. This in turn gives every individual an increased dividend rate-their share of the economy's progress. A citizen will be able to invest any capital OUTSIDE their base share in whatever ventures he/she deems judge mentally sound. Whatever funds accrued extra to base share will be divided into payment into the country's base share rate; and half into whatever non-profit organizations the individual chooses upon their death.  The individual will retain extra wealth made through his/her entire life.. It should be noted that during times of hardship, every citizens share will drop in value and everyone's base payment will go down. Thus, the base should not be depended upon to provide you with a living IN case of major economic hardship.

A one base child policy will have to be implemented to balance against economic growth-the parents share value will be transferred to children equally, in form of cash, in the event of death. With extra funds an individual(s) can afford to BUY extra base share rates, and subsequently they can have as many children as they can afford to provide for. State orphanages will be set up and funded for kids without parents/extraneous cases, paid for by dividends from their own shares. Basic reproductive education will be taught to all kids starting junior high.

Political leadership positions will all require mandatory military service in some form or function, even if as custodial. Active Military members shall be provided with 2 extra base shares for return of service to country, redeemable to family upon death in form of cash. Thus, every military member is first and foremost-a warrior, willing to lay down their life for the country.

If the United States Constitution were to be considered the article to which these(or further refined)Amendments were to be applied, a massive re-education campaign would have to be implemented to teach the populace the fundamentals of economic exposure and the implications this has on their lives. Every person with base shares would have to be sworn in as a citizen-patriot, fully understanding their roles in the economy. A mandatory 4 year community or reserve military service minimum consisting of part time(8hrs/week community; 16hrs military)service depending on skillset will be required of individuals, to be completed before age of 30. All institutions and businesses valued above 10 million U.S. Dollars will have base shares-with tiers of base share percentage increasing correspondingly to company cap size-as well as extra investor funds. A base share cannot be bought, sold or transferred except in any shape except under the citizens death or voluntary relinquishment-it would be liquidated equally into the economy, unless cash value is passed down equally to children. The only payment a citizen can expect is a quarterly dividend, not guaranteed during times of economic hardship. Federal reserve would have to peg all accounts with corresponding value in Gold, adjusted for daily. Tax laws would have to be adjusted. Capital gains tax would pay into government spending, including military and education. In essence, equal ownership and responsibility through the form of a share of the country you are born/become part of. Every citizen must pass a history test including individual view essay to assume ownership of share at age 18, unless mentally incapable of doing so. This essay will be held by reserve until your death, when it will be burnt. All monetary figures must be adjustable for variables, the share ownership per citizen must never change. Base share ownership would not be a weight on the economy, rather, on the contrary it would be a stable base from which to continue expanding and growing as a nation as well as individuals. If convicted of a felony, or 3 misdemeanors a person shall have their share revoked pending appeal from a court upon release. A citizen may always opt out.

patriot,politicaldiscussion,A plea for level-headedness regarding Sony & North Korea,"I have no idea if this is the right sub-reddit, but it seems to fit.

There's seems to be a widespread hatred, for lack of a better term, as a result of the Sony hack and cancellation of The Interview's release. I'll go ahead and cite this thread as what prompted me to say something:

[If you were going to assassinate Kim Jong Un, how would you do it?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2psi7i/if_you_were_going_to_assassinate_kim_jong_un_how/)

Given the thousands of upvotes and comments (read: ideas on how to kill Kim Jong Un), I have to believe that the reddit community is largely okay with this idea.

""If you were going to [kill] Kim Jong Un...""

""If you were going to [kill] [a real, living person]...""

No, I don't think the context matters here. I don't think a mob of people describing how they would kill someone (and finding entertainment in the idea) is ever a good thing. Was it meant facetiously? Perhaps. Since when does that make it okay?

In fact, this disregard for another human's life is exactly what got The Interview into trouble in the first place. It depicts a very graphic, violent, and realistic death for a real person. The comparisons made to Charlie Chaplin and Three Stooges Hitler gags are laughably inadequate.

To be clear, I am a huge supporter of free speech. I don't think anyone should be censored for saying or doing anything controversial. However, I do think it's wrong to fantasize about and laugh at someone's murder, dictator or deplorable person or not.

So this is my plea to you to not give into the mob mentality of violence and blind oo-rah patriotism. Think for yourself and be the best person you can be.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2ptr6k/a_plea_for_levelheadedness_regarding_sony_north/,1419025007.0,2ptr6k
patriot,politicaldiscussion,"Do you agree Bin Ladin's 2004 speech was 99% true?;""oppression and the intentional killing of innocent women and children is a deliberate American policy. Destruction is freedom and democracy, while resistance is terrorism and intolerance.""","A few key passages:

""I say to you that security is an indispensable pillar of human life and that free men do not forfeit their security, contrary to Bush's claim that we hate freedom.

If so, then let him explain to us why we don't strike for example - Sweden? And we know that freedom-haters don't possess defiant spirits like those of the 19 - may Allah have mercy on them.

No, we fight because we are free men who don't sleep under oppression. We want to restore freedom to our nation, just as you lay waste to our nation. So shall we lay waste to yours. ""

""I am amazed at you. Even though we are in the fourth year after the events of September 11th, Bush is still engaged in distortion, deception and hiding from you the real causes. And thus, the reasons are still there for a repeat of what occurred. ""

""I say to you, Allah knows that it had never occurred to us to strike the towers. But after it became unbearable and we witnessed the oppression and tyranny of the American/Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine and Lebanon, it came to my mind.

The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth Fleet helped them in that. This bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorised and displaced.

I couldn't forget those moving scenes, blood and severed limbs, women and children sprawled everywhere. Houses destroyed along with their occupants and high rises demolished over their residents, rockets raining down on our home without mercy.

...

And as I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children.

And that day, it was confirmed to me that oppression and the intentional killing of innocent women and children is a deliberate American policy. Destruction is freedom and democracy, while resistance is terrorism and intolerance.""

""Is defending oneself and punishing the aggressor in kind, objectionable terrorism? If it is such, then it is unavoidable for us.

This is the message which I sought to communicate to you in word and deed, repeatedly, for years before September 11th. ""

""we have found it difficult to deal with the Bush administration in light of the resemblance it bears to the regimes in our countries, half of which are ruled by the military and the other half which are ruled by the sons of kings and presidents.

...

he took dictatorship and suppression of freedoms to his son and they named it the Patriot Act, under the pretence of fighting terrorism. In addition, Bush sanctioned the installing of sons as state governors, and didn't forget to import expertise in election fraud from the region's presidents to Florida to be made use of in moments of difficulty. ""

""those who say that al-Qaida has won against the administration in the White House or that the administration has lost in this war have not been precise, because when one scrutinises the results, one cannot say that al-Qaida is the sole factor in achieving those spectacular gains.

Rather, the policy of the White House that demands the opening of war fronts to keep busy their various corporations - whether they be working in the field of arms or oil or reconstruction - has helped al-Qaida to achieve these enormous results.

And so it has appeared to some analysts and diplomats that the White House and us are playing as one team towards the economic goals of the United States, even if the intentions differ.

...

As for the size of the economic deficit, it has reached record astronomical numbers estimated to total more than a trillion dollars.

And even more dangerous and bitter for America is that the mujahidin recently forced Bush to resort to emergency funds to continue the fight in Afghanistan and Iraq, which is evidence of the success of the bleed-until-bankruptcy plan - with Allah's permission.

It is true that this shows that al-Qaida has gained, but on the other hand, it shows that the Bush administration has also gained, something of which anyone who looks at the size of the contracts acquired by the shady Bush administration-linked mega-corporations, like Halliburton and its kind, will be convinced. And it all shows that the real loser is ... you.

It is the American people and their economy.""

Please do not just reword opinions given by political entertainment personalities such as Sean Hannity, Larry King and the like. The media doesn't care about the truth, they only care about what is going to make them money. CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, etc. They focus on entertainment. I only care about real opinions from people that have actually read these bills. 

Freedom isn't paid solely in the blood of our service members. Freedom's price isn't paid solely by the wounded in battle, both psychological and physical. That isn't the entire price of freedom. The price of freedom is vigilance, it is the citizens watching what the government does past what we see on the entertainment news outlets. I urge everyone to look at the bills I posted and all the other bills that are in congress. They are all public record, and there is a government website that exists because of a law passed in the Clinton Administration. The Freedom of Information Act is more than a way to petition the government for information. That Act exists so we can see what the government is doing in real time.

patriot,politicaldiscussion,Am I the only one around here who wants a clean political slate?,"The frequently stated but false definition of insanity often phrased as doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results, exemplifies a keynote issue troubling America. That is, why do Americans continue to elect the same politicians who have caused or allowed this nation to creep ever closer to its demise, continue to govern? It could be our lack of good politicians to elect or it could be that we are too disorganized to accomplish anything different. There are many people in this country dissatisfied with the current situation but they are too befuddled by the myriad of problems to achieve a solution. Why do the vast majority of Americans stand idly by as our freedoms are being systematically constricted? How we became so indifferent to losing our freedom is astonishing. It could be because those in power are creating fear and using it against the American people to enact their will for their own benefit or it could be we are too timid of the people we put in power to hold them accountable for their atrocities. The patriot act is the most unconstitutional piece of legislation waged against the American people. It is a blatant attack against people’s fourth amendment rights set forth by our founding fathers. The so-called patriot act carries out unwarranted surveillance of multiple aspects of many individuals’ lives from communication to spending habits, all hidden under the guise of security when it could not be further from the truth. This is what I call Ameripocrisy, when the government preaches one thing but then conducts itself in an entirely different manner. It is time that the American people start holding politicians accountable. The politicians of America work for us, they are meant to represent the real people of America, not the special interest of mega corporations and mega banks deemed too big to fail. If you had a friend who would always lie to you, who said that he would help you when you needed but never followed through and instead only helped out his richer friend, would you still talk to that person? If that same friend then stole a good deal of your money and used it to bail out his greedy over-spending friend would you let it happen without so much as a protest (TARP, 2008)? The answer is no. You would no longer consider that person a true friend and would disassociate him. The simplest solution is to stop being fools and electing the same politicians who continue to solve nothing. While this will not solve all the issues, it is a start. Refuse to be treated like pawns for the powerful people. Have a little pride, do not lie down and be quiet, stand up and shout that you want your government and freedom back, and you will not quit until you get it.

patriot,politicaldiscussion,"A Reply from Congressman Mike Rogers -- PRISM ""cannot and does not monitor the communications of any U.S. citizens [sic]""","I just signed a petition regarding the protection of the Fourth Amendment Rights in light of the recent NSA revelations. I got a response from Mike Rogers, who claims that PRISM does not monitor communications of any U.S. citizen. But my understanding is that both pro- and anti-PRISM advocates all agree that U.S. citizens' data are being monitored (or at the very least collected), and the debate is whether warrants were obtained for these searches. Are pro-PRISM advocates now saying that no data from U.S. citizens are being collected at all? I have copied his response below. 


""Thank you for contacting me with your concerns regarding the protection of your Fourth Amendment rights. I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.
 
As chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), it is my responsibility to ensure strict and thorough congressional oversight of the important work done by America’s intelligence agencies. I have been disheartened by dangerous national security leaks that have grossly distorted two vital National Security Agency programs that have proved very effective in preventing terror attacks in the U.S. without infringing on Americans’ privacy and civil liberties.
 
At a time when the Obama administration’s IRS, Benghazi and Justice Department scandals have understandably damaged Americans’ trust in their government, it is important to understand why these programs are different. Neither program allows the NSA to read e-mails or listen to phone calls of American citizens. Both programs are constitutional and do not violate any American’s Fourth Amendment rights. Both are strictly overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a federal court created in 1978 to protect the rights of American citizens in the course of foreign intelligence gathering.
 
There are also several layers of checks and balances put in place around these programs within the executive branch and Congress. Both programs are overseen by lawyers and compliance auditors from the Department of Justice, the director of national intelligence and multiple independent inspectors general. Both have also been authorized by large bipartisan majorities in Congress and are regularly reviewed by the House and Senate intelligence committees. The effectiveness of these programs is without question. Both have produced vital intelligence that has prevented dozens of terrorist attacks within the U.S. and around the world.
 
The first program allows the NSA to preserve a limited category of business records to help identify foreign terrorists and their plots to attack the U.S. This court-authorized program allows NSA to preserve only phone records such as the numbers dialed and the date, time and duration of calls. These records do not include the names or personal information of any American and do not include any content of calls.
 
When the NSA wants to query the records, it must establish through a court-approved process that there is a reasonable suspicion a specific number is connected to a foreign terrorist. Only a limited number of analysts can obtain approval to conduct a narrow and targeted search of those numbers. If U.S. connections are found, they are passed to the FBI for further investigation. If the FBI wants to determine the identity of a phone number resulting from an NSA search, they must obtain a separate court order. These call record searches, which are regularly audited for compliance by all three branches of government, are a vital tool for connecting the dots between foreign terrorists plotting attacks in the U.S. and in other countries.
 
The second program, known as PRISM, allows the NSA to obtain a court order to access the electronic communications of suspected foreign terrorists overseas. Because much of the world’s Internet traffic flows through U.S. infrastructure, the law allows the NSA to obtain the specific communications of foreign suspects from U.S. companies with a court order. This program does not create a “back door” to any U.S. company’s server. This program cannot and does not monitor the communications of any U.S. citizens.
 
All 535 members of Congress have had access to classified briefings describing the specific uses of these two programs, though not all members have chosen to attend these briefings.
 
It is important to consider the source of the news media leaks about these two vital intelligence programs. These leaks came from a person not involved in the careful execution of these programs, and with access to only small pieces of a larger puzzle. He decided to break the law and the oath he took to the American people by publicly disclosing parts of these classified programs, and then fled to China. These are the actions of a felon, not a whistle-blower.
 
The effectiveness of these programs depends on them being kept secret from the foreign terrorists they target. It is much easier for terrorists to hide from us if they understand the sources and methods of our intelligence gathering. We have already seen al-Qaeda begin to shift their communication tactics as a result of these leaks, and it will now be much harder for us to find them.
 
It is no coincidence that the leaders from across the American political spectrum who take the time to understand these important programs are also their strongest supporters. They understand that these narrowly targeted programs are legal, do not invade Americans’ privacy rights, and are essential to detecting and disrupting future terrorist attacks.
 
 With regard to the program called XKeyscore, it is important to understand that this tool is not used in connection with the NSA’s receipt of metadata pursuant to Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The NSA may not use this tool to target a U.S. citizen without an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Further, the unauthorized disclosure of classified material about XKeyscore without the proper context only causes more confusion and harm to our national security.
 
As Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee I take the privacy rights of Americans very seriously. That is why I believe in having a robust dialogue to address concerns expressed by the public and Members of Congress. Rest assured, I will continue reviewing potential changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to improve transparency, strengthen privacy protections, and further build the confidence of the American public while ensuring that our Intelligence Community retains the tools it needs to protect our nation. For a link to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on the issue, please click here: http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/313429-1. 
 
Again, thank you for contacting me. Please feel free to contact me in the future should you have additional questions or concerns.
 
 Sincerely,
Mike Rogers""

patriot,politicaldiscussion,The Current State,"  My name is, Jamey Howell, and I am a 21 year old college student living in the United States of America. I have always been told to appreciate where I live for multiple reasons. I have never experienced a shortage of food, clean water, clothing, housing, or anything else that is deemed as an ""essential"". I have also come to appreciate privileges like freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the ability to get an education free from persecution. Why is it then that I am so embarrassed to say that I'm an American sometimes? That might seem like a tough question to answer considering all the freedoms I am granted, but I assure you the reasons are not only there but they are innumerable (hyperbolically speaking). The current state of our country, of my country, and of my forefathers country is disgraceful. While, I do believe the government is largely to blame for this state the burden falls on the citizens as well. The biggest mistake we as citizens have made can be summed up into one word, and that word is Toleration. I will speak more of this later. The biggest issue is with our nation's ""leaders"".
        
   To highlight all of the problems with our government would take me months to write out so I am just going to highlight some of the biggest issues. The first issue I'd like to discuss is our fiscal policy. With the current government shutdown ongoing and the possibility of defaulting on our financial responsibilities on the horizon this is a very commonly talked about subject. I don't think people are talking about the right things though. All you will hear from either political party is that it is the other parties fault. Most of what you will hear citizens talk about are just the bullet points they saw on CNN or Fox News at dinner last night. From a liberal stand point you will hear people say how irresponsible the Republicans are for holding the nation hostage with a government shutdown. From a conservative stand point you will hear about how irresponsible the Democrats are for their unwillingness to negotiate, which forces the Republicans hand in the shutdown. Those are the issues being talked about instead of the fact that no matter who is right or wrong the reason the government shutdown was because our politicians decided by a majority not to raise the amount we can continue to borrow. That ""ceiling"" has been raised 74 times since 1962. How anybody thinks this is a sustainable plan of action is beyond my understanding. I do also understand how devastating a government default would be to our economy. It would undoubtedly lead to a recession worse than what our nation faced in 2008. The question to be asked is, ""Where does it stop?"". Our current national debt is $16.9 Trillion dollars. That sounds like a lot right? I'll say it again, $16,962,733,100,965. That number gets bigger every single day. The net interest we owe on our debt alone is, $260 billion dollars, and rising every day. Regardless of your political affiliation it doesn't take somebody with anything more than a high school education to tell you that this is not only unsustainable, but highly irresponsible. No matter how you've voted throughout your life the people we have put in office have continued to let this number grow. Liberal or conservative doesn't matter anymore. We are faced with much bigger issues than whether you agree with same-sex marriage, abortions, gun ownership rights, or whatever else it is that the media tells you is important when you cast your vote. The irresponsibility of our governments spending cannot be tolerated any longer. Whether we are paying for wars that can't be won, presidential vacations, ridiculously high salaries and benefits for all members of congress, eventually an unsustainable government healthcare system, or whatever else it is that we spend millions, billions, and even trillions of dollars on. Our leaders past and present have bankrupted our nation. There is no denying this. Politicians will tell you that these things are necessary expenditures to keep our government running the way it is and that is the problem in and of itself. We cannot and should not continue to operate our government the way it is now. If our government stays on the same track it is on we will never get out of debt. I have no official education in business or finance, but I do know that if my expenses increase more than my revenue that I will eventually be in debt. To avoid that debt I would have to reduce spending or increase my income. Nobody would successfully argue against that logic. What our government has done instead of apply basic business principals is to increase spending, increase taxes, and most importantly increase borrowing. This model has not, and will not ever prove fruitful. One of the main reasons our government spends so much is because our government is too big. That brings me to my next point.
       
  Thomas Jefferson said it best, ""My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government."" At its best a government should be a servant to the people. What we are currently witnessing now is our citizens essentially being enslaved by the government. This can be observed in multiple ways. The biggest and most obvious way is in taxation. We pay federal income tax, some pay state income tax, some pay state sales tax, we pay property taxes, wheel taxes, and so many other taxes. Essentially any money you make or spend is being taxed one way or another. If you try to avoid these taxes you will be in debt to the government and considered a criminal. People would be able to live with this if the money was being spent wisely. How is it we are taxed so much yet our government is in debt to a point where the amount we are in debt is realistically unfathomable to our understanding. $1 trillion dollars is a lot of money. $16.9 trillion dollars is so much money that if all 7 billion people on earth started counting right now we would not be able to count that high collectively before every single person alive now is dead. Let that sink in. This is debt that even if we started reversing now would not be paid off by me, my children, or my children's children. The only way to start this reduction is by drastically decreasing the size of our government and everything the government has its hands in. Decreasing the size of government will naturally decrease the expenses it requires to run a larger government. This is pretty basic stuff. It is clear that our government is no longer concerned with our well being, but with the amount of power it can attain. It is for this goal that all logic has been thrown out the window. How many powerful men or women do you know that are in debt beyond what they can ever repay. That power doesn't last for long, especially when people come to collect on that debt. It is beyond the time for the people of the United States to rise up and say, ""No more."" This brings me to another point. Governmental control.

  The idea of rising up against the government is great in theory, but how would it work in practice? Anybody that goes against the government by doing anything more than exercising their right of free speech would be treated as a terrorist to the United States government and be dealt with accordingly. They don't even need concrete charges to detain you anymore. Your right to Habeas Corpus can be waived if the government feels it necessary. This should scare everybody. And just to be clear this doesn't just apply to a foreigner. This can and will be applied to a citizen of the United States if the government feels you are a threat. Even if a second American Revolution did begin the government would implement martial law and the U.S. military would be used to carry out these orders. As passionate as some patriots would be this isn't exactly firing muskets at each other in a corn field. I don't know anybody that personally owns any fighter jets, tanks, or has access to a drone. Any rebellion or uprising by the people would almost undoubtedly end in military action and the decimation of whatever resistance there was. I say all this to make my point of the government being too big and far too powerful. You can be assured our government would not relinquish their power unless forced to. Something tells me that there aren't a lot of countries that would send their military power to help us out either. After all, the country that intervenes more often than not in another country's domestic affairs is the United States itself. This brings me to my last point to be made about our government. Minding our own damn business. 

   Whether it is military intervention in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, or any other country our government feels the need to involve themselves in it needs to stop. It has been proven over the last decade that our involvement not only does not fix things, but potentially has made things worse. I am not ignorant to the fact that there are countless human rights violations happening as I type this all over the world and it is horrible. If we could fix all of these problems I would be the one of the first people in line to help however I could. The truth is that we cannot fix these problems by throwing money and missiles at them. If you disagree with this look at the amount of civilian casualties in the middle east caused by our government. I always hear the argument of what if we hadn't intervened with Nazi Germany and helped stop the holocaust. On this point I have several thoughts. When we entered into that war we had no idea of the scale of genocide taking place, and we only threw our horse in the race when prompted by direct attack on our own soil. The government is worried about human rights now as they were back then. Not nearly as worried as they want you to think. Once again it comes back to power. Do you think there was no ulterior motive for the United States in WWII? After toppling the Axis powers and killing hundreds of thousands of those country's citizens we were undoubtedly THE world power. There are other motives today just as there were back then. One of the biggest differences today is the fact that we have no money to spend on these things yet we do it anyway. I think donating to a charity that helps people out is a fantastic thing if you have the money to do so. If you can't even put food on your own family's table though then it is probably an unwise move to donate huge sums to a charity. That might sound cold or harsh, but it is true. That is essentially what our government does. They can't even get our own financial situation right yet they are spending countless dollars interfering with other countries affairs. We don't have the money to do that, plain and simple. All of this is being done at the expense of the citizens. We are spending billions of dollars annually in foreign aid and military action and nothing has really changed. The middle east is still in turmoil and always will be until change comes internally from those countries. The people of the United States must DEMAND a change. Then and only then will anything start to turn around. This brings me to my last point and that is directed at the citizens of our once great nation.

  The citizens of the United States of America have sat idly by as our government runs our country into the ground. We have taken this abuse for far too long. I'm not suggesting violent acts against our government in any way. I'm suggesting peaceful, yet forceful protest. There are still enough checks and balances within our government for the people to take back control, but only if we DEMAND it. This is not the people firing the first shot. This is the people taking back what is ours as guaranteed by our constitution and our founding fathers that drafted it. We can take action by voting out the people that are in power and replacing them with true patriots. We can select these people. We ultimately decide who we give power to. The common thread in my writing so far, if you have noticed, has been WE. WE the people hold the power. Our government should be made up of servants for WE and for US. That is what made our country great in the past. Unity. United WE must stand for the republic that our great flag represents. When I think of American spirit I don't think about what our government is now. I think about a united country standing up for what is right and for what is just. For liberty and justice for all. We cannot tolerate our current government any longer. Stand with me. Stand with US. DEMAND change.

""... God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive.
If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty.... And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms.
The remedy is to set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.""

patriot,politicaldiscussion,How different is the current Tea Party rhetoric about Obama from the far left rhetoric during the Bush years?,"Inspired by this post from /r Politics and The Dish - http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2013/10/13/this-is-where-we-are/

I understand the shutdown and 'blackmailing' currently going on is fairly unprecedented and outrageous, so lets put aside that for right now. We know it is fucked, and this doesn't need this to dissolve into a discussion about the last two weeks. Bear with me.

In regards to tone, content and goal of the messaging used by the far right during the Obama presidency, is it really that different from what was being said by radical liberals about Bush and Cheney?

I know this will probably cause a lot of ""How dare you make a Obama/Bush Comparison...Iraq War/Patriot Act/Etc..Etc.."" But I ask you to try to put your politics aside for a moment and really think about the messaging. The far left wanted to Impeach Bush, and introduced house bills claiming similar breaches of the constitution, election fraud, NSA Surveillance Overstepping (Irony?) etc. Is one era's Ted Cruz another era's Dennis Kucinich?

There is a lot of talk about how batshit crazy the Tea Party is, and how they should just respect that Obama was fairly re-elected, and that ACA is a law, etc., but is it really that much different from radicals from the other side? The Tea Party may just be louder (possibly due to the rapid growth of social media and its adoption by tradition media outlets, lower barrier of entry to self publishing online, etc.) and better funded than the radical left in the Bush years.

patriot,politicaldiscussion,Student loans: evil or pure evil?,"So I'm raging against student loans, because they are formed from Satan's farts, and I have written a letter which I plan to email to all the Democratic congresspeople and the moderate Republicans.  Oh, I'm raging, baby.

Here is the letter if you care to read it.  If you don't, that's OK. This isn't school or anything.

Dear Congress,

I am writing in regards to Student Loan Debt. I am a Millennial voter trying to get out of my debt. All of my friends are in the same boat.
 
We our important. We are voters. We represent an entire generation of middle class youth. 37 million people are paying back student loan debt.  In 1980, the average cost of college was $5,000 which included all tuition, fees, room and board. When I graduated in 2009, that number had quintupled. What I was told in a public school was that if I went to college and graduated, I would be better off than if I didn’t go.  Because of the state of the economy, I would have been better off if I had not gone to college. Even with forbearance and deferment, interest accrues on the loans, so they quickly balloon. According to American Student Assistance, between 2004 and 2009, only 37% of borrowers made timely payments. 

How is this the law of the land? I grew up in the United States. I pledged the flag every day at school. I sang the patriotic songs every morning. I honestly thought the government of the United States had my best interest in mind. I believed that if I needed help, as long as I was an honest citizen, the government of the US would show me favor and work with me. I thought the US government would offer me protection under the law from usury.

Please introduce a bill for student loan forgiveness. It should apply to people who entered college after 2000 when the cost of college tuition became out of control. It has since increased twice as much as medical care, which increased twice as much as the consumer price index.  College increased four times the amount it should have! The student loan forgiveness program should take that into consideration.  If a person owes $200,000 in student loans, as a friend of mine who went to NYU for film does, have her owe $50,000 or $100,000 and help her get on a system that can pay that off while still allowing her to have a real life with children and a husband.  Unfortunately, she is in now default, like so many others I know.

The government of the United States should care, because it is in the best interest of the country that young middle class people have options in life and financial freedom.

First, we could buy houses and start families.  Now, we’re putting off purchasing a home and having children because of the financial burden of paying off student loans. People who own their homes contribute more to home renovations than renters, as they should. Think of all the extra money that could be generated by construction alone.  Most importantly, our children are the ones who will become the doctors and engineers that really advance this country and make it the leader in innovation. The US wants college educated young people having children. How many very productive citizens are not being born because of high student loan payments? That harm won’t hit the economy for another 30 years. Politicians spend hours talking abortion, but where are the tears for my unborn child, the one I cannot afford to have?

Second, we could start businesses. I have a friend who is a waiter and paying $700/month in student loan payments, $8,400 a year! It is really a shame because he’s a smart handsome guy, but at 27, he is single with two male roommates, and he can just make ends meet. If he could use that money to start a business, he might employ dozens of people in ten years. Instead, he uses it to pay interest on loans. Multiply that by 100,000 or however many of us there are.  Economically, that makes no sense.

Third, we would be more politically involved. Student Loan reform was a huge factor in Obama’s election in 2008. He really did little that would help us. The reforms don’t go into effect until 2014. Kids going to college in 2014 have the benefit of seeing what happened to us. What about us who don’t benefit from the lesson or the programs?

College costs way too much. That is the real problem that needs to be solved immediately for future generations. It costs $50,000-$200,000 for a bachelor’s degree, and employers still want to see experience for low paying jobs like secretary work. Students’ career options then become very limited. Some choose to go back to school to defer payments and interest, but they have more loans in the end.  Some college graduates have to take unpaid internships, which are often little more than free labor for companies, in the hopes it lands them a real job. Others still are painfully underemployed in jobs outside their chosen field.  It really is out of control.

Why does the government of the United States allow educators to charge more than our families can afford for school knowing that a college education is the only way to a middle class life? You cannot be a receptionist in LA without a college degree, and receptionists make $12-$15/hour. Why are private lenders allowed to prey on us with student loans if they cannot offer us credit cards? 

Well, it isn’t right. I am disappointed in the older generations that manipulated us so much. They are twice or three times our age, and they say they are helping us. They’re ruining lives is what they’re doing.  They’re worse than the bankers who sold subprime loans to people who couldn’t afford them, because those people were adults, not 18 year old kids. No banker would ever give an 18 year old a mortgage, but the same amount of money for a college loan is OK. That makes no sense.

Please introduce this bill because it would really speak to young people. It will really help us make a better future for ourselves and for our country, and it will get us to the poles in the 2014 and 2016 elections.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Esteban von Carlo

patriot,politicaldiscussion,My analysis of some ways the US Govt and Society have aimed to control its citizenry,"JUST A HEADS UP EVERYONE: This is a very long post, but these are things that I am passionate about and believe are worth thinking about, even if you don't necessarily agree. So, I'll put the tl;dr at the beginning here: 
The entire social and political system in this country is really messed up, and the people with money are the people with power. They make a point to instill fear in the people while simultaneously keeping the majority of them in poverty just so that the people are distracted while they can stay in power and use the citizenry to make money and get ahead.

NOW for the full post:

This [article](
http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/The_Deep_Game) points out exactly what I've been trying to say for a while now:
""Corporate money is the power behind all of it, and that corporate money has but one goal -- the creation of a largely subjugated population and a workforce grateful for whatever scraps fall from the table. To accomplish this, the corporate money not only had to disable the institutions of self-government that are the people's only real protection, it had to do so in such a way that the people expect less and less of the government and, therefore, less and less of each other, acting in the interest of the political commonwealth. (The dismantling of organized labor is a sideshow to the main event in that the goal there was to cripple organized labor's political power within the political institutions so that there would be no countervailing force that could be brought to bear against the destruction of its power in the workplace.) For all the endless bloviation about the dead-hand of government, what the vandals in Washington are shooting for right now is a subject population whose tattered freedoms depend on the whimsical ethics of the American corporate class. This is the really deep game being played here, and they're more than halfway to winning it.""

Now, if you've got the time, I'd like to talk to everyone about some things that we all should be aware of... These are all my own thoughts, and each paragraph is another talking point.

We've got the music industry promoting rap artists only if they rap about gangs, violence, bitches and hoes, and being proud of having a tough time growing up. So then the poor kids who listen to that stuff become accepting of living in a shitty environment, because it makes then strong. Surely it does, but feeling complacent for it is exactly what will keep people from standing up for themselves and fighting against a flawed system, one in which they are the tools being used for the gain of those in power. 

We've got standardized testing in schools, and to such a point that there is no time to deviate from the required curriculum. Kids are force-fed facts and taught to regurgitate them in the form of shaded bubbles, only to forget those facts once remembering them has served its purpose. Some kids MAY learn something, but very few ever learn how to think critically. Just another way that the population is being manipulated from the time they are born: taught not to think, and to accept the hand you're dealt. 

Likewise, we're the only nation in the world where our students are taught to ridicule the intelligent. I've always been a pretty smart guy, but I've been taught form an early age to downplay my intelligence, to avoid making my fellow students feel inferior and to just stay quiet, and also to avoid ridicule for being a ""teacher's pet"" or a ""show-off."" This is one aspect of our society that I have no idea how it originated! Why do we teach our children and our citizens to be proud of being simpletons? and to be ashamed of being smart? Why did I hear so many people state proudly that they voted for George W Bush because he was ""just like you and I"" and wasn't some intellectual? Because that would have made the people feel inferior? Don't you guys think we should be electing the most intelligent people to be the ones making decisions on behalf of everyone?

But then again, that's actually one of the inherent problems with a democracy: the people will tend to elect the candidate who is most charismatic, not necessarily the one who is most qualified. We like people who can talk, it's completely natural! Also, the person who would actually be the best for the job probably didn't even run or campaign! The kind of person who would care about the common good and try to pass legislation on behalf of the people is not the same kind of person who seeks out power, and thus they likely would not want to put forth the effort and the exorbitant funds required to get a position in power. You're more likely to find that person volunteering at their local soup kitchen on the weekends. But then again, I don't think it matters because...

We've got money in politics, keeping lawmakers in corporate pockets so they can push legislation that promotes their own interests at whatever costs to the people. Even if the politician was running with good intentions, the amount of money-raising required just to sit down and talk to the people you need to help you campaign already has you compromising your views and who you are before you even have a chance to run. And even once they do get their seat, they're in a constant state of paranoia, forever monitoring their own behavior to ensure that they get the Party support as well as the funding necessary to remain an incumbent. And of course, the rampant gerrymandering helps with that. And it doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican, Red or Blue, their both promoting the same corporate interests by the time they get their seat. 

Like the author in the article I linked stated above, one of the most terrifying interests the lawmakers have been promoting, particularly since 9/11 and the Patriot Act, is to negotiate the suspension of freedom through the use of fear and desperation. Additionally, by promoting violence among the black community, they serve as the scapegoat for those in power. The man who steals from his fellow man because he feels he has no other choice or because he knows no other way serves as the distraction from the real thieves, the billion-dollar scandals that happen in the banks, on wall street, and in the corporate money-business. 

And while we're on the topic of the money-industry, I'd like to address the way that the poor are kept poor. Through the use of late fees, high interest rates, and even straight-up lying to the customers, the banks in this country take advantage of the ones who can just barely get by. Not the destitute though, because if they default on their loans the bank makes no money. No, it's the people who are going to struggle to meet the terms that the bank sets for them so that they can wring them for every last dime. then when those guys fuck up, they get billions of taxpayer money in the form of a bailout! And did you know that HSBC bank in the US was found to have been financing drug cartels and terrorist organizations on the scale of billions of dollars? You know what happened? They were too big to prosecute! Through an extensive hierarchy of command and the ability to pass blame, as well as the fear that shutting down their organization would cause problems in the economy, those people got off with NOTHING. NO JAIL TIME, they just had to forfeit 1.256 billion dollars, which was likely just a portion of the money they made from criminal organizations. 

And on top of that, we have the big push by religion to forcefully embed themselves in our society. Now, I have no issues with those who are religious, or those who are spiritual. I think it's natural as a human being to seek a higher power. However, I believe there is a strong distinction between ""faith"" and ""belief"" that should be made. Those who believe in a God, or a higher power, based on the evidence available and what they feel about it, those are people with beliefs. The people with faiths, however, tend to take a zealous stance on their religion, refusing to question what they have been taught is ""the word of God"" and attacking anyone who might disagree with them. And they usually do that through attacking the person's character and avoiding actually addressing that person's argument. When a person automatically stonewalls anyone who disagrees with them, and refuses to even think about what they believe in, there is a high potential for religious extremism and violent actions in the name of ""God."" Additionally, promoting this kind of blind faith help to demote critical thinking once again, helping to keep the masses in line and unquestioning of other aspects of their lives. 

And one of the other reasons I believe Christianity is being pushed into our society lately is because the current incarnation of the Church promotes pitting the people against their fellow man. Christ-based views have long been forgotten by the Organization we call ""The Church."" Those people no longer promote ""love thy neighbor"", ""treat others as you wish to be treated"", ""turn the other cheek"", or any of the kind of ideas that Christ tried to spread that would have promoted love. Instead they pick out specific passages and twist them to promote hatred and pitting your common man against one another. Hate the gays, Hate the non-religious, Hate the muslims. 

We teach our children not to think, to become cogs in the ever-disparate economy that fills the pockets of the owners of this country. We teach them not to question, for fear of alienation from their fellow man, and fear of the judgment of God. We point out the ways we are all different and teach people from a young age to hate one another for it, instead of pointing out all the ways we are similar and rejoicing in it. 

Regardless of how you believe it came to be, we all have received a wonderful gift by being here today. You could even call it a miracle. But as long as we're busy trying to chase the almighty dollar, or finding ways to make ourselves feel superior to others, we will only continue to tear ourselves and our fellow man down. Instead, we should realize that all men are created equal, and that through kinship, hard work, and cooperation, we as a species have the potential to do great things.

So please people, if you can, take notice of the kinds of things that are going on in the world today. It can be very depressing at times to see and hear about all the ways that people are mistreated. But only through intelligence and understanding, and knowing what we're up against, do we have the potential to rise up and choose for ourselves what kind of world we want to live in. A lot of local police have begun receiving bullet-proof military vehicles and using SWAT teams for everyday police work, which I think is a sign that the people are growing weary and restless with the powers that be, and those powers are getting scared and defensive over what ""We the People"" might do. We need to keep our government and the people with a lot of money (and thus power) in check, before they accumulate so much power that we can't stop them.

patriot,politicaldiscussion,"The military may defend our ""freedom"", but it does not defend our ""freedoms"".","Let me explain.

The United States military defends the sovereignty of the United States of America.  Their job is to ensure that any country that wants to attack/invade/take-over the USA fails in their attempt.  This is an unfortunate necessity of living in a world in which there are always people that wish to do other people harm.  I support the men and women who are willing to stand in harm's way to ensure that the safety of our nation is ensured.

The United States military absolutely and 100% does NOT defend our freedoms.  They do not defend the freedom of speech or the freedom to assemble or the right to due process or any other freedom/right held by all citizens of the United States of America. 

Invading Iraq does not ensure that I can say Obama (or Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney or any other number of people) is a war-criminal and not get arrested for it.  

Bombing Pakistan does not ensure that, if I'm accused of being a terrorist, I get a speedy trial in front of a jury of my peers.

Attacking Syria does not ensure that my private emails are not inspected by the federal government without probable cause.

Assuming that we remain a sovereign nation (refer back to paragraph #1), the only people who can take away our rights are the US government.

If the US military defended our freedoms, they would be holding Congress as POWs until the Patriot Act was repealed.  They would be occupying the headquarters of the NSA until PRISM and whatever other unconstitutional programs they were running were dismantled.

This rhetorical crap bothers me every day, but I feel like I can't speak up about it without being viewed as someone who hates the military.  Of all days though, I feel like this needs to be said today.

If you agree with me, I hope you realize you're not alone.  If you disagree with me, I hope this spurs some intelligent debate.  Or you can just call me derogatory names.

patriot,politicaldiscussion,Why is Snowden considered a whistleblower if nothing he exposed is illegal?,"A whistleblower is [somebody who exposes misconduct within the government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower). The actions of the NSA have been legal for almost a decade, and any American has access to the laws that made it so. Since 2005 any of us could have read the PATRIOT Act and what it allowed, and many voiced their opinion for the opposite. To reveal what the government has been legally allowed to do is not whistleblowing, so why do people think Snowden is a hero or important in any way? Anybody who was interested has known the NSA procedures were legal and have been happening for a long time, and the laws were passed publicly and approved by the majority of the American people. Perhaps Snowden showed the American people what it truly looks like, thus bringing attention to the issue again, but STILL most Americans are okay with what the NSA is doing. Snowden is therefore not a whistleblower, just someone who revealed **legal**, clandestine practices that *some* (but not most) Americans find distasteful.

patriot,politicaldiscussion,"I asked my Senator, Robert Casey, about NSA spying and he said I shouldn't worry and that it is making me safer.","Here is the full text of the letter...

Thank you for taking the time to contact me about the recent revelations around the National Security Agency’s (NSA) telephone and internet surveillance program.  I appreciate hearing from you about this issue.  

 

In June 2013, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed himself as the source of a leak of classified information relating to U.S. government surveillance program.  Disclosed through a series of articles in The Guardian (UK) earlier in the month, Snowden’s information included details on a court order for Verizon users’ phone data. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. government has charged Snowden with espionage, theft and conversion of government property. Since the leak, Snowden has traveled from Hong Kong to Russia. The Administration has urged Russia to transfer Snowden back to the U.S. to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged.

 

On June 12, 2013, General Keith Alexander, chief of both the National Security Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command, testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee. General Alexander said during the hearing that the U.S. surveillance programs have helped thwart “dozens” of terror attacks, including the cases of Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan-American who pled guilty to a 2009 plot against the NYC subway system and David Headley, the Pakistani-American who facilitated the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India.  

 

Under the Patriot Act, as reauthorized in 2005, user data ""must be 'relevant' to an authorized preliminary or full investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a U.S. person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities."" The 2005 Act also established congressional oversight for the FISA program, requiring the DOJ to conduct an audit of the program and the ""effectiveness"" of Section 215, and to submit an unclassified report on the audit to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary and Intelligence.  

 

We need to make every effort to ensure our national security and the safety of the American people.  It is also essential that the executive branch operate with transparency and ensure that our counterterrorism efforts do not infringe on the civil liberties of American citizens. 

 

I have concerns about how the administration has interpreted Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which makes it easier to obtain business records deemed relevant to a national-security investigation.  On June 13, I attended a classified briefing with administration officials to discuss these issues and Section 215 of the Patriot Act.  I look forward to continue examining this issue in the current session of Congress to ensure that we are not sacrificing our fundamental values and ideals in the face of critical threats.

 

Again, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.  Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future about this or any other matter of importance to you.

 

For more information on this or other issues, I encourage you to visit my website, http://casey.senate.gov.  I hope you will find this online office a comprehensive resource to stay up-to-date on my work in Washington, request assistance from my office or share with me your thoughts on the issues that matter most to you and to Pennsylvania.

patriot,politicaldiscussion,"My email to my representative after his vote of ""no"" on the Amash Amendment. What do you think?","Dear Representative Delaney, 

My name is **Removed**. I am a veteran of the Iraq War and currently a college student. Recently you voted “no” to the Amash Amendment to de-fund the NSA’s current data collection program and to rescind article 215 of the Patriot Act. I am sorely disappointed in your decision to abandon the privacy rights of not just the constituents of your district, but all Americans nationwide. Privacy is a chief attribute to freedom, and one’s assurance that the things they do on a daily basis aren’t being arbitrarily monitored for future use is paramount to free society and the ability of the people to hold their government accountable. If we must live in a society where our decisions on whether or not to voice our opinion on aspects of government regulation are based upon whether or not we might have done things in the past that could potentially embarrass or hurt our image or the image of those around us, the we are not living in a free society. This is what you have voted for by derailing potential legislation that would maintain the privacy of American citizens. 
	Please, do not misunderstand my love for this country. If there is a threat to the sovereign borders of this great nation, then by all means steps should be taken to protect them. Acting on the possibility of future threat however is not a way to run the surveillance program of the United States. Verifiable and tangible evidence must be secured prior to any actions that may cause the potential loss of life are taken. Storing data of millions of Americans for future use just because someone, somewhere, may be a potential threat is absurd. This represent the actions of the former Soviet Union at the height of its power, not the representative democracy of the United States. There very well may be someone down the street from me plotting to rob a bank, murder their wife, or commit fraud on their tax returns – but until the act is committed no action can be taken (unless verifiable proof of intent is established). 

Yes, I do think that organizations like the NSA are a valuable asset to this nation and its citizens. I will not stand for the arbitrary collection of data however, in an attempt to further the nation’s security. A famous statesman once said, “Those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither”. I hope you take these words to heart and understand that broad strokes of surveillance by clandestine organizations, who are accountable to none is not the mark of a free country. I will be watching with cautious optimism in the hopes that you will take these words and show me and many others like me that there still is a glimmer of hope within the walls of congress. 

You are a representative of the people. That means that regardless of your own views, your responsibility is to represent the wishes of your own constituents. Unless your constituents are calling for the mass murder of people, I think you would be wise to listen to their voices. We are, after all, the ones who put you in the place you are today. 

My vote depends on your actions, 

With Sincerity,

patriot,politicaldiscussion,Does anyone else notice the severe changes in our government?,"I'm certainly not the youngest one here, at 23. I'm certainly not the oldest either. But I've been around to see the last 4 presidencies, and I've noticed a huge change in our country.

Our president, seems more like a company mascot, than the CEO. I know it's not needed for everyone, but here's a quick rundown of how our government is **supposed** to work. 

Our government is mainly defined by three branches. Under these three branches, all forms of government are run.

We have the Legislative Branch, Executive Branch, and Judicial Branch. These are the main responsibilities of each of those branches

Legislative - This branch includes Congress, made up of the Senate, and House of Representatives. A bill must pass through Congress first, after a Congressman decides to back it, and stand up for it. Then, the two entities vote separately. First with one, then the other if it passes. After this, it is sent to be signed by the President.

Executive- This branch includes the president, his cabinet, the military, and other forms of government entities that enforce laws, and protect citizens. The president holds the ability to veto laws passed by the Legislative branch, and can direct the military of the United States. 

Judicial - This branch includes all forms of judges, both local, military, and national. They have the power to deem certain things unconstitutional, and overturn laws. They are most well known as the Supreme Court.

If anyone has clarifications on any of this, I would be happy to hear/change it. I'm by no  means an expert

However, the problem I see with this right now, is that the legislative branch has way too much power. They can create laws, on their own rules, without any checks/balances from other governmental entities. The only way to get past a law that is passed into legislature, is to have the Supreme Court deem that it is unconstitutional, or unlawful. The issue with that, is that the Supreme Court is bogged down heavily, and cases have to be seen by lower-level courts first. It also requires a Supreme Court lawyer, who knows the specifics of how things work with the Supreme Court...something that costs way too much money for a normal citizen.

Things like the Patriot Act. This was passed with popular approval, during a controversial presidency, and tragic times for America. It was a 'kneejerk' reaction as my mother would say, a reference to reflex testing by doctors. An event happens, and people take immediate action, without thinking. The government used 9/11 as a catalyst, to gain more control. They now have the ability to tap into American citizens phone lines, innocent people, and listen to calls. There have been cases of people being arrested, without notifying the persons arrested for what they were being arrested for. Cops are shooting dogs during search warrants, without provocation. People are being arrested for 'Impeding an investigation' for not allowing police officers to take quarter in their home. 

The Patriot Act, to most at it's creation, was a questionable bill, but patriotism made most say 'Well, the government won't abuse that power', or 'I have nothing to hide'. This is called complacency. Those who know American History, will know this is similar to what happened during the Revolutionary War... the Patriots back then, realized citizens under the crown were becoming complacent, with the strict rules and taxes that the crown was enacting on them. So they took rash action, possibly the most rash action anyone could imagine, cessation and the Declaration of Independence. A war, fighting to change things. We saw this again, during the Civil War, the South felt the North was trying to control state's rights, and seceded, and a war was started.

People during the birth of America, were willing to die for what they believed in, and more importantly, willing to kill for what they believed in. Nowadays, most people can't even be bothered to protest. I see a lot of people here on Reddit, 'omg nsa' and such, with memes. These things **do** help in some way. It helps people remember. Keeping these thoughts in the media, and in the minds of citizens is what inspires change. But that change does not start with this inspiration. People can be inspired at all times, to do things, but until those things are done, nothing will ever change. 

Our country is slowly turning from a Republic, a represented Democracy, to some strange thing that I do not know what to call it. But it is frightening to me, as a citizen. 

""To conquer a nation, First disarm its citizens""

""Demoralize the enemy from within by surprise, terror, sabotage, assassination. This is the war of the future.""

""The great strength of the totalitarian state is that it forces those who fear it to imitate it.""

""The great masses of the people will more easily fall victims to a big lie than to a small one.""

patriot,politicaldiscussion,I filled out an online petition against the NSA spying I was linked to on reddit. This is the response I just got from my senator (CT).,"Thank you for contacting me regarding recent reports of alleged improper actions by members of the Obama administration.

I have been hearing from many of my constituents, like you, every day, voicing their frustration with a number of improprieties that members of the Obama administration have allegedly taken over the course of the last several years. These reports deal with a range of issues important to our country, and I appreciate your correspondence and the opportunity to address your concerns.

First, it has become clear that the IRS improperly targeted and unfairly scrutinized the tax filings of certain political groups. I believe that political targeting of any group or individual is an outrageous abuse of power whether it be by the IRS or any other federal agency, and I agree that this incident must be investigated promptly. Also, like you, I am concerned by actions taken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to obtain the telephone records of reporters and editors at the Associated Press and other news organizations. The DOJ is charged with upholding our laws and helping to keep the American people safe; these actions raise serious questions about whether the appropriate balance has been struck between the desire to prevent the release of classified information and the need to protect the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press. Please be assured that I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to make sure that those responsible for improper incidents are held accountable.

Second, it was recently reported that the National Security Administration (NSA) requested the phone records for millions of Verizon customers in the United States, and through a program known as ""PRISM"" tapped into the servers of several major online entities, including Google and Facebook, to intercept communications as part of alleged terrorism investigations. Though the NSA argues the programs are legal under laws like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the Patriot Act, many Americans have understandably voiced their concern that the NSA's actions unnecessarily infringe upon the civil liberties of our citizens. I find the data collection by the NSA troubling, particularly given its apparent enormous scale. While we need to be diligent about strengthening our national security, I've always been skeptical of government overreach into private lives. During my time in the U.S. House of Representatives, I voted against measures that expanded this type of data collection in an effort to protect the privacy of individuals in Connecticut and across the country. I'm increasingly concerned that Congress and the American public have not been able to appropriately debate the trade off between security and privacy in our fight against terrorism, because too many of our efforts are being conducted in a covert manner. I am working with my colleagues and members of the administration to gain a better understanding of what information is being collected and why, and whether additional oversight mechanisms need to be put in place.

Finally, as you are aware, on September 11, 2012, the U.S. Ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in a horrific terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi. Ambassador Stevens, a former Peace Corps volunteer, was dedicated to helping the Libyan people build a better, more democratic future. I condemn the attack on American diplomats in Benghazi in the strongest terms. These attacks cannot be tolerated and those responsible should immediately be brought to justice. Furthermore, we must improve our systems in order to ensure that these types of attempted attacks are thwarted in the future.

During a recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that I participated in, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified regarding the Benghazi attack, and detailed the findings of the independent Accountability Review Board (ARB) that was convened in its aftermath. The State Department has already implemented several of the ARB recommendations, but it is clear that we must do more to address the systemic deficiencies that have been identified to improve the safety of American officials abroad. I recently cosponsored a bipartisan measure in the Senate to provide more funds for embassy security upgrades, and I will to continue to advocate for adequate resources to support and protect the members of our Foreign Service as they work to promote peace and democracy overseas. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate as we continue to respond to these national security challenges and support our nation's diplomatic efforts.

As new reports shed additional light on these incidents, please know that my overriding priority as a United States Senator is to work for the good of the country, rather than a party or special interest group, and to ensure that the constitutional rights of all Americans are respected and upheld. As I continue to monitor developments and work with my colleagues in the Senate to investigate and find solutions, please be assured I will keep your comments in mind.

Thank you again for contacting me about this matter.  I appreciate hearing from you and assure you that I will always do my best to represent the views of my constituents in the Senate.  In the future, please do not hesitate to call me in my Connecticut office at (860) 549-8463 or my Washington office at (202) 224-4041. 

            Every Best Wish,

patriot,politicaldiscussion,Why you shouldn't be surprised about the NSA,"Background: entering my senior year of political science at a university in London.

The struggles with the public sphere of relations(me, you, reddit, etc), is that there is a lack of political education. In high school you're taught about how government functions and operates, not the theoretical discussion behind it. Theory isn't just some bored academic writing a paper, its a process of developing a coherent understanding of the rules or trends in certain political environment (domestic or international). Domestic politics is influenced by the international scene, and vice versa (source: Peter Katzenstein) 

I believe that the reason we do things now, is because of the historical implications of the Cold War, such as the NSA. The NSA was started by Truman at the end of the second World War. but thats irrelevant really. The NSA is there because of neo-realist policies, in regards to communism. At the end of the second world war, the only way to rebuild your 'nation' or 'state' was either getting funding from the Americans or the planned economy of the Soviet Union (who also had resources as the americans such as trucks, factory equipment, etc.) What I am getting at is that the NSA is an outdatted remnant of when the U.S.A. had to have an internal intelligence agency to stop any infiltration of 'the reds' and a role to preserve the world from turning to socialism. The whole notion of neorealist policies, is not about defeating communism though, its about national security. Neorealists believe that the governments in this world have all the power (to protect the national security), and there's nothing one can do about it. 

Why you shouldn't be surprised by NSA snooping is because the people in the U.S. government don't see it as right or wrong, but as a derivative of policy makers who have been bred in American universities since the start of the 20th century to obtain **national security** as the primary objective. (taught neorealism and neoliberalism)

Now that the Cold War is over, who the hell are we defending against? Thats the issue, there is no 'us' and 'them' really anymore. So the NSA's job now is to pursue terrorists or other non-state actors, because they can't specifically say that China or Russia are a threat. There and lies a fundamental weakness, international politics is evolving from U.S. hegemony, to several strong players in the international arena. 

To conclude, the NSA is just the U.S. coping with its fall in hegemony in the international scene, so they have to find new targets and new objectives to propel the military industry complex(private interests), and the country. Because if you don't know who your enemy is, then why is the government there to defend you? Honestly, the neorealists are right pretty much each time. and its made evident by the lack of response from the obama administration on the drone strikes, illegal killings, and now domestic eavesdropping. So the government is still in power and we are just at the will of it because it has the military and police force.

There's nothing to be done about the NSA or drone strikes, the same policies that make you feel safe and secure in America, is what lead to the Patriot Act. Its not what people want to hear, but honestly I believe trying to protest on the internet is useless, we need to be out there on capital hill. Who is 'we'? The university students who live in America, (18-27), we are the next generation, how the hell are putting up with this poor government?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gyi4p/why_you_shouldnt_be_surprised_about_the_nsa/,1372062572.0,1gyi4p
patriot,politicaldiscussion,It's past time- what would a New Declaration of Independence look like?,"A New Working Version Of The Declaration Of Independence Part 2. Tell me what you think! What do you think needs to be added/removed? What wording needs to be changed as has harmful implications etc... 

When in the course of history it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political and economic bonds that have colluded to strip national and global citizens of their human rights, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind require that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. 

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all sentient beings are created equal; that they are endowed with certain unalienable rights, that among these are the right to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. 

We hereby declare that no true democracy is attainable when the process is determined by economic power. That when a government attempts to tyrannize, enslave and abuse its own people; it is the responsibility of the people to reclaim and protect their rights. That a long train of abuses and usurpations have been committed in a direct attempt to undermine democracy and reduce the people under absolute despotism. That when a democracy is usurped by corporations which place profits over life, justice and equality it is the right of the people to institute a new Government organized in a manner to provide for their safety and security. 

We stand together in solidarity to fight off the injustices for which the rights of the people set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States have been abused, usurped, and denied through the corruption of our government. Such has been the patient sufferance of the people; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. We gather together in solidarity to express a feeling of mass injustice. Let these facts be known:

*That elected representatives and government officials have continually betrayed the trust of the People selling out our government to the highest bidder corrupting our processes of civil, democratic governance and allowing a small group of wealthy individuals and giant multinational corporations. That said collusion between the United States Government and private interests has resulted in the denial of basic human rights and have committed injustices against all life on this planet.*

*That said collusion has continually undermine and prevented the ability of the people to unite and advocate for better pay, living wages, safer working conditions, reasonable hours, and job security.*

*That instead of protecting our economy by preventing monopolies, the government instead props them up with tax breaks, subsidies, decreased regulations, and bail outs.*

*That our government has created a system where the banks are allowed to steal our homes out from under us through the manipulation of markets and policies. A system where student loans for private profit seeking entities has resulted in the economic enslavement of an entire generation crippling them.* 

*That collusion has lead to the closings of public schools, extreme increases in the cost of higher education and corrosion of education itself.* 

*That our government has given away and sold out our airways, roadways, land, public goods and resources to corporations who in turn charge us for their use.* 

*That collusion has lead to the pollution and destruction of our food system resulting in inadequate and unsafe food and drinking water.*

*That collusion has lead to the pollution of our environment and the endangerment of countless animals.*

*That collusion has denied countless patients access to effective and necessary medical treatments. That our government has allowed for our regulatory agencies like the FDA to be corrupted by major industries like the pharmaceutical industry.*

*That such collusion with corporations has perpetrated colonialism and imperialism at home and abroad through the misuse of tax dollars derived from the people.*  

*That elected government has sent our military into an illegal war in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan without clear military goals or the necessary supplies to ensure success. This war perpetuated torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas in our name. That our government has ignored the Geneva Convention and must answer for war crimes and release political prisoners.* 

*That collusion between the government and private interests has lead to the illegal torture and detention center Guantanamo Bay as well as the military industrial complex.*

*That our government illegally smuggles drugs into our country for political power and profit. Our government then continually allows our major banking institutions to launder money for the major banks without recourse.* 

*That our government at the same time continues to wage a War on Drugs against its own people, which has failed leading to increased drug use, mass incarceration and extreme violence at home and in our neighboring country, Mexico.*

*That our government has allowed for profit prisons and policies resulting in the largest prison population in the world.*

*That our government has systematically perpetuated racist policies through our public education and justice systems. Racial profiling has lead to the disproportionate mass incarceration of Black and Latino Americans.* 

*That our government has systematically perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of one’s skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.*

*That our government has failed to adequately protect the rights of children refusing to ratify Declaration of the Rights of the Child as member of the United Nations.* 

*That our government has failed to adequately protect the rights of animals allowing torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of animals for profit.*

*That corruption of our representatives and courts has lead to the passage of numerous laws which violate our constitutional rights; Patriot Act, Homeland Security Act, National Defense Authorization Act, Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, Troubled Asset Relief Program, National Defense Resources Preparedness (Executive Order 13603), Citizens United.*

*That our government has attacked the freedom of our press using the courts, police and military in attempts to silence the press. Our government has taken over our mainstream media in attempts to keep the people under control through misinformation and fear.*

*That our government has allowed private interest to buy out our elections, has assassinated our leaders, prosecuted our whistleblowers and brutally oppressed our dissent.*

In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms. Our repeated -petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.  Today, we are united by our realization that we can no longer silently allow ourselves to be the passive subjects of a political and corporate media system that consistently ignores, trivializes, and misrepresents the reality of our concerns, our histories, and diverse cultures. We must, therefore hold them as Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We believe that a fair society requires a framework for informed and meaningful participation by all people; and that democracy derives its legitimacy from treating all persons, indiscriminately with social, political, and economic fairness. We have divergent goals and opinions, but are nonetheless discovering a common bond of respect and responsibility for our collective future.

We, therefore, solemnly publish and declare, that we the People, are a Free and Independent State, that we are absolved of all allegiance to the United States Government. As a Free and Independent State we have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and things which Independent States may of right do. The outcomes we seek will extend to the limits of our compassion, our integrity will determine each step. For the support of this Declaration, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

elites,politicaldiscussion,How should we handle potential conflicts of interest when private-sector leaders take on advisory roles in government?,"There’s been growing concern in recent years about the influence of private-sector figures who hold temporary or informal advisory positions in government. One recent case involves Elon Musk, who has held a Special Government Employee designation under the Trump administration while simultaneously serving as CEO of SpaceX and Starlink.

Diplomatic cables and media reports suggest that U.S. diplomats may have advocated for Starlink's market access during trade talks—raising questions about whether public foreign policy is being shaped, even indirectly, by private commercial interests.

Some argue that this kind of public-private overlap can drive innovation and efficiency. Others warn it opens the door to elite capture and unaccountable influence.

As a progressive, I do not understand why anyone would object to moving forward and advancing society via progressive norms. Humanity, since its inception, has done nothing but progress technologically and socially. It is inherent to human nature to progress and make strides forward for the good of the human race. So, I ask, what point in time is the most ideal for conservatives to stay at or return to? Evidently, based on the popular Trump slogan ""Make America Great Again,"" there is a specific era of American greatness that has gone by the wayside that many would like to see reemerge. Does that mean returning to the civil unrest of the 1950s and 1960s, an epoch largely devoid of rights for blacks and other minorities? What policies do conservatives wish to see removed and/or reinstated? From the looks of contemporary conservative legislation (or the lack thereof), Republicans only seem to invest time in going backwards or obstructing (eg repeal of Obamacare and obstruction of marijuana legalization respectively). In many instances, conservative policy seems to only benefit the wealthy (such as lowering taxes). So, what exactly does the non-elite American conservative wish to accomplish?",528,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/nmxs04/what_do_american_conservatives_wish_to_accomplish/,1622208274.0,nmxs04

Civil conversation seems to be nonexistent in all quarters. When looking at the issues in society that have lead to this, it would seem to me that systemic racism, inequality, and money in politics have either caused or exacerbated the breakdown in our discourse.

Would a premise such as a mandatory cultural exchange performed in in middle school (ages 11 to 14) and then again in high school (ages 14 to 19) possibly help? By cultural exchange i mean two or more Americans from different socio-economic, racial, and or religious backgrounds are placed together for a defined amount of time (ie 1 year) in which they learn together and from each other. The implementation is up for debate but the idea is to create a mandatory exposure to someone different. Public schools used to be this but the people in power send their kids to elite homogenized schools, thereby sidestepping this social mixing pot.

Mandatory military/civil service would be required to vote, hold government contracts, hold political office, etc. I get that it may seem like a Poll Tax, but seeing as we already have criteria you have to meet to vote (be of legal age, be a citizen, etc) could that not also be legislated?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/kn6myz/would_a_mandatory_cultural_exchange_and/,1609349706.0,kn6myz

Sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 have not been lifted, Trump approved the sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine — something Barack Obama did not do — and he has ordered missiles fired at Syrian military sites, openly targeting strategic operations and allies of Russia.  *(Here’s where Trump has been tough on Russia — and where he’s backed down, CNBC)*

He advocates for things that we traditionally skewer the government for, things like secretive writing of legislation, as a means of getting the government to effectively operate.

I had never before entertained the idea that a certain amount of transparency is a bad thing, and that political elites with unelected power are necessary in such a large political system.

elites,politicaldiscussion,Two main Russian state media outlets have released op-eds on the Clinton/Trump race. What does the wording of these articles say about the Kremlin's stance on the candidates?,"Excerpts and my analysis appear below

RT:

>Despite a concerted campaign in America to link the Republican nominee with the Kremlin, there is no evidence to support the narrative that the Russian government wants Donald Trump to become the next US President. 

>To anyone who lives in Russia, or has spent considerable time here, the notion that Moscow could recruit Trump and bend him to its bidding is frankly preposterous. Russia remains a great power, but one with considerable domestic challenges, economically and socially. As a consequence, its authorities, to state the completely obvious, have better things to do than conniving overseas on this scale. Not to mention that Trump is so erratic that you’d barely trust him with a drinks order, let alone a plan so cunning and convoluted that even John Le Carré wouldn’t touch it. It’s really that ludicrous.

>Armed with this knowledge, it’s reasonable to assume that Putin is not very excited about a putative US supremo, who in a moment of remarkable hyperbole, equated him to a man responsible for the deaths of millions of Russians. But that doesn’t mean Putin, a politician of immense experience, is overjoyed about the prospect of Trump either. If mere words were all it took to discommode the President, he’d hardly have survived close to two decades on the frontline of Russian politics.

>And so this brings us to the man they call ‘the Donald.’ It's hard to swallow the notion that Russia’s highly educated elite could favor anybody this uncouth and unstable. His foreign policy suggestions on NATO might sound like music to Kremlin ears, but the rest of his platform doesn’t. Trump isn’t merely proposing an American rethink on NATO-area Europe, but a wider American withdrawal from the world and an extremely isolationist outlook.

This appears very much addressed at the recent hacking controversy, but it looks to me to be almost as negative to Trump as to Clinton. 

Sputnik:

>Trump Probably Makes Russia Nervous Despite Backing Crimea Secession

>US presidential candidate Donald Trump’s call for improved relations with Moscow and his apparent backing of Crimea’s decision to secede from Ukraine are unlikely to inspire confidence in Russia.

>""It strains credulity beyond the breaking point that Putin would want Trump to be president of the United States, unpredictable as he is,"" McGovern, who briefed three US presidents and headed the CIA’s Soviet policy branch, told Sputnik on Monday.

>The whole premise is crazy, McGovern noted, that Trump’s embrace of better US-Russian ties somehow makes Putin a fan.

>""I know a little bit about Russian and Soviet leaders,” McGovern added.  “The last thing they want is somebody who is proud of being unpredictable and who gets irate at the slightest slight.”

>That Putin, McGovern added, would want Trump to have his finger on the nuclear button “is a leap of faith that I cannot possibly make and remain sane.”

>""With respect to Hillary, I’m saying there’s no lesser of two evils,"" McGovern said. ""I don’t think he [Putin] wants Trump to win. I don’t think he wants Hillary to win either.""

This one parrots a lot of the temperament concerns I've heard in my office about Trump.

elites,politicaldiscussion,"What counts as ""left-wing"" and ""right-wing"" foreign policy in the United States?","I've noticed a lot of people on this sub referring to, for instance, Hillary Clinton's vote on Iraq as a mark against her left-wing credentials, and military intervention as a notably ""right-wing"" policy, but I'm not sold on these arguments by a long shot.

It seems from my perspective and my study of American history that this paradigm shift seems to be a result of the Iraq War. Opposition to the Iraq War became a defining issue for the Democrat/Republican split, and in turn we started to see it as a left-right issue, but it's never been that simple. I think we can see that from the behavior of the Obama administration, but also some context from the last century of American history.

For much of the 1920s and 1930s, the Republicans were the isolationist, non-interventionist party in American politics, especially when it concerned Europe, while the Democrats were more pro-globalization and pro-intervention. FDR was constantly pushing the US to get more involved in the global sphere, and Truman after him. The Cold War ushered in a new phase of American involvement, one that remained fairly consistent in a lot of ways due to the influence of the Establishment (big-E), a clique of State Department and Defense elites who (generally) pushed containment and domino theory.

In this context, we have the foreign policies of Ike, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon to look at. On a broad sense (excepting things like the CIA activities in Iran) it would appear that Kennedy and Johnson, Democrats considerably to the left domestically of Ike and Nixon, presided over the more interventionist policies, including Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs, and the Dominican Republic. Nixon did end the war in Vietnam, but in this he seems to have played Obama to Johnson's Bush, trying a broader array of options to end hostilities in Southeast Asia with mixed results, some of which are quite reviled to this day. 

I'm not as familiar with the differences vis-a-vis Reagan, Bush Sr., and Clinton, but Reagan's military spending and rhetoric were obviously more interventionist and hawkish than Clinton - however, even with the reduction in defense spending, Clinton still had Bosnia and Somalia, as well as the low-key opening salvos of the War on Terror (though we didn't know it at the time.)

So this brings us to the modern day and the War on Terror. Had Al Gore been President when/if 9/11 occurred, then invaded Afghanistan and engaged in the other adventures to this date (probably not Iraq, but you never know), would we regard foreign intervention as a left-wing or Democrat ideal, considering that this could be seen as consistent to a degree with Clinton's foreign policy? Is the difference in rhetoric and defense spending the real dividing line, or are the actual results - which seem quite mixed between Democrat and Republican, or left and right - what truly matters here?

elites,politicaldiscussion,"I don't buy that ""The Establishment"" is desperately trying to stop Trump.","**THE ARGUMENT,** as I understand it, is that The GOP failed to take him seriously, pinned all their hopes on Marco Rubio, and didn't realize Drumpf was a real threat until he controlled a commanding number of delegates. 

Once they ""realized"" he was in position to control the destiny of the convention, they scrambled the A-Team to pump out some Drumpf-Seeking missiles. 

They repeatedly claim that essentially, the wealthy and powerful didn't do their homework (as the elite often do /s) when it came to electing the next American President, and didn't notice the math until there was no going back.

OK. Let's put a pin in that. 

Now he's got a comfortable grip on the primary, and ""The Establishment""'s A-Team has lobbed a few volleys. 

We have to assume, that since it's the A-Team, they must understand nuances of sophisticated political messaging. If they do, they must be aware of the *glaring* flaw in their entire strategy, the flaw that pervades all of their ads: **The way they attack him directly helps him.**


It's important to understand the posture of many of the Drumpf supporters. They **rightly** feel hosed by the establishment, who has essentially focused exclusively on [making the rich richer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM)  

They're many of the same people from the roots of the ""Tea Party"" who were ready to put social issues aside to address important fiscal issues.  You may recall that the Republican Establishment seized on this movement and professionally rerouted it's energy toward abortion and gun rights, which don't cost the elite any money. 

They're mostly decent people who feel like Government doesn't work for them, and they're pretty pissed about it.  They don't see either party looking out for their interests, and in that way they're kind of post-partisan. 

There's also a strain of white supremacy that's found a home with Mr. Drumpf.  It's not everyone, but it's not avoidable either. These people tend to be loud, and what they say is extreme so it attracts eyeballs.  

But most of his supporters aren't that.  Many are would-be Bernie Sanders supporters who have too long been told that socialism is the devil and that their problems are caused by the powerless, not the powerful.

And don't take my word for it. Obviously they're all individuals and your mileage may vary, but I've talked to a lot of them and these are the refrains I hear over and over again. For a quick taste, go read some of the comments over at r/The_Donald.

Many see Drumpf as an ""anti-establishment"" ""populist"". If you are a voter inclined to supporting him, any message that comes from a Mitt Romney Super PAC is met with heavy skepticism often mixed with disdain.  

The A-Team is aware of all this. They must be. They're The A-Team. They know where he's weak and where he's strong.  

They understand the now infamous Claire McCaskell [primary ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec4t_3vaBMc) that [cleverly disguised](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/todd-akin-missouri-claire-mccaskill-2012-121262) itself as an attack ad while promoting the opponent she wanted to face in the general. They know what to say that will look and sound like an attack ad, but will actually **reinforce** many of the beliefs of the Drumpf supporter.

Do you believe that Drumpf voters are buying any of [this kind of shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJQfPu7Ljmk) from who they perceive to be ""The Establishment"" that has so screwed them for decades?

Do you believe that Drumpf voters are discouraged to hear that Donald [uses naughty words?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thw6k1XNRtc) (In front of a waving flag and uplifting music, no less.)

Do you believe that Drumpf voters are discouraged to hear that [Jimmy Carter?](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/268247-cruz-uses-jimmy-carters-words-in-anti-trump-ad) has an opinion on Drumpf?

Do you believe that Drumpf voters don't feel their anti-establishment beliefs *vindicated* by ads [like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANpTguURCDY)

Do you think that Drumpf voters are impacted by [these sob stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgQ9dqs76v0) about Drumpf University?

No. They see Drumpf as an effective, if morally questionable operator. And they want him to operate for them.

All the while, the real assets of the establishment are doing him nothing but favors. The Establishment media has been All Drumpf All The Time, vigorously pumping his name into the collective consciousness and delivering him more than [TWO BILLION](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-2-billion-free-media_us_56e83410e4b065e2e3d75935) dollars in free media.  

If there's one video that perfectly encapsulates the mainstream media's approach to Donald Drumpf, make the time to carefully watch[ this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I3E3-U-1jc) from Morning Joe regarding Drumpf's proposed Muslim Ban. 

To anyone who's worked around these scenes in modern politics the purpose of the interview is clear. Drumfp said something controversial, and this interview serves as a landing pad for him to soften the harsh edges and produce favorable quotes to be used headlines to inoculate people's primary concerns. From this perspective, we can see what an oblivious dufus this guy is.

There are plenty of well refined techniques to producing an effective soft landing interview, but the general rules are... 

1) Ask the obvious questions. There are questions that media unfavorable to you are likely to ask if you don't.  By asking them first, you can control the tone and guide the resulting conversation. 

2) Help your guest. When a candidate is in need of a soft landing, they're usually about as frazzled as they get. Don't put them in a position to say the wrong thing.  If possible, share the questions with the guest ahead of time. If not, be sure to ask the question in a way that suggests the answer.  People aren't paying much attention to the interview - it's really about getting the best possible words on the record and avoiding further trouble. 

This is the most extreme leading I've ever seen. Drumpf repeatedly misses the lead entirely and doubles down on anti-Muslim sentiment, which is what brought him here in the first place. The exasperation can be seen on the host's faces as this drags on. Around 13 minutes you can hear them scribbling notes to one another trying to figure out how to structure the question so this idiot'll get it. 
**Leading**

*5:14 - *5:40 - *6:13 - *7:05 - *8:30 - *8:58 - *9:56 - *10:15 - *10:27 - *10:38 - *10:57 - *11:09 - 11:19 - *12:30 - *13:45 - *14:05 - *14:57 - *15:37 - *15:53 - 17:35 - *18:30 - *19:26 - *19:40 - *20:25 - *21:15 - *21:40 - *23:55 - *24:58 - *25:15 - *25:25 - *25:40 -*26:27 - 
 
Many of their questions begin with *epic* levels of brown nosing. Sucking up is usually limited to saying positive things about the candidate around the margins.  This is entirely different. By my judgement, it's half that they have to kiss the ring of this Man/Boy mob boss, and half that they just have to reassure him they like him and aren't out to get him.

**Suckups**
4:06 - 17:35 - 18:18 - 21:15 

And throughout the interview they're so focused on trying to get this Man-Child to say the right thing, they don't have the bandwidth to disguise their purpose. They even have to keep reminding him ""I agree"" and ""I'm on your side"".

Drumpf even seems to accidentally almost confess to some of inside knowledge about some kind of nefarious activities??  Listen carefully to 21:50 through 23:20.

Then video goes dark at 24:30 for about 20 seconds, which makes me wonder if he said something even more stupid and MSNBC cut it from the youtube clip.  Anyone got an as-broadcast copy?
 
You can see Mika fail to conceal a smile after Drumpfs hilariously stupid answer at 25:52 after repeatedly dodging questions about specifics about his plan to beat ISIS. Watch from 25:00 on for the full effect.

Is he talking about ISIS when he says he's going to ""knock out the capital, big and strong""?

There are dozens of segments with Drumpf much like this from many different corporate news outlets. It's silly. 

I doubt there are many political operatives who watch that segment and see anything other than a metaphorical warm towel and a handy. 

There are some truly hilarious goings on if you're into these sort of things. [Watch Ben Carson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7en16r-OmJk) admit several things he shouldn't. My favorites are 1:50, 2:10, 2:25, 2:42, 3:00. You may hear an anchor stifle a laugh or two.

For anyone familiar with the DC scene, it's pretty clear that ""Morning Joe"" has long been one of the premier mouthpiece of those who benefit from the statuesque: The Establishment.

They are *the* show that sets the pace for the day's news. In my opinion, more than any other show Morning Joe controls the news cycle.  

And I'm supposed to believe that The Establishment doesn't like Donald Drumpf?

Please.


What it looks like to me is a party that encouraged a clusterfuck of a primary, keeping party and mercenary candidates in the race long after their expiration date ([Carson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7en16r-OmJk), Rubio, Christie, Fiorina) in order to split the vote just right to keep the headlines reading ""Donald Drumpf #1"" while they repeatedly say they're not worried about him. He builds up his brand and loyalty on the company dime in a controlled environment until he's able to mostly stand by his own by February. 

""The Establishment apparently didn't take him seriously until the day after Super Tuesday, when he became inevitable. Now they feign a fight that, to me, looks weak and hollow compared to the actual strength of the establishment messaging machine. It seems like overspending on intentionally ineffective advertising that serves only to ""prove"" you're trying. 

The media constantly reminds us of the vast expense of the Anti-Drumpf efforts, but we're talking about controlling the narrative of the election of the President of the United States. What's $682 million among ~20 multi-billionaires? Especially since the bulk of it is paid to each other anyway for the consulting and advertising fees. 

TL;DR: I'm skeptical. Their words don't match their actions. I don't know what they want, but I doubt it's what they say. ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4b3k7o/i_dont_buy_that_the_establishment_is_desperately/,1458402579.0,4b3k7o
elites,politicaldiscussion,What's next for the Republican Party?,"I may be oversimplifying things, but the Republican party as I see it has three major wings.

1) Religious conservatives.
2) Business interests.
3) Tea party/Trump/next demagogue anti-compromise authoritarians.

This primary has made it clear that those three groups will no longer work together. The Trump supporters can't be trusted to compromise for the good of the party, and they can't trust the rest of the party to help them burn the building down. Cruz's religious wing isn't particularly more cooperative. Rubio is trying to walk a line among all three, like a good candidate typically does. But this year the anti-compromise sentiment is so strong he's failing.

I think it's clear that the Republican party as we have known it is over. They've spent thirty years purposefully growing a base that thinks compromise is evil, when it's a fundamental requirement of civilization. More relevantly, compromise is required to form a major party in a two-party system. The party elite has told their base that the system is evil. Now that base has realized that the party elite are part of that system, and it's consuming them.

No two wings of this party have enough voters to survive without the third. So what's next? The possibilities I see:

1) Republicans somehow hold it together. With an anti-compromise wing this is only possible if the anti-compromise wing gets everything they want. I don't think enough evangelical Christians are willing to do that particular deal with the devil; a lot of us would end up just not voting. The business interest wing can buy Democrats almost as well as they can Republicans these days.

2) Republicans disintegrate into two or more parties. Since our voting system fundamentally breaks if there are more than two candidates, Democrats win everything everywhere, at least as long as the fractured parties actually run candidates at levels other than President.

3) Republicans and Democrats both disintegrate. I don't see enough substantial fracture lines for this to happen in the short term, but in the medium term it's imaginable that we'd get a fracture within the Democrats. Some of the more right-wing elements leave and join the moderated Republican business/religious wing to form a viable second party, leaving the more progressive wing behind. American politics shifts leftward, to be more centrist. The anti-compromise wing is still out there, left in the cold, waiting for another demagogue to run as a third-party candidate.

4) Election reform renders the two-party paradigm obsolete. Use approval voting and proportional representation for all elections, and suddenly political parties become much less relevant. Can happen on a state-by-state basis.

Obviously I'm hoping for #4.

elites,politicaldiscussion,"The perfect candidate, 1956. How would we re-write this today?","The perfect candidate for the Presidency of the United States was born some fifty-four years ago in a modest but ramshackled farm house in the pivotal state of Ohio. Of a sizable family, which arrived from England shortly after the *Mayflower*, he grew up on the farm, performing the traditional chores and thus becoming well acquainted with all farm problems. When he was in high school his father died, the farm was sold, his strong and sensible mother moved the family to a near-by small town, and the struggle began.

The future President worked in his uncle’s factory, quickly becoming a practical expert on all labor and management problems. while putting himself through college. He arrived in France during World War I just in time to make clear, for a full six months, that, in another war with more time, he would undoubtedly be a statesman of note. Returning home, he went to the state law school for two years, married his high-school sweetheart, whose grandfathers  fought with the Confederate armies, opened his office, and joined the local party club, as well as the Elks, and in due course the Rotary Club, and attended the Episcopalian church. He is having a very busy life now, but can stand such strains, for it is as if his constitution was built for them. During the ‘twenties, he represented a group of small factories in their relations with labor, and was so successful that during the ‘thirties there was no labor trouble of any consequence. Other companies, noting this as a remarkable fact, also engaged him, and thus, with the publicity, he became mayor of his city in 1935.

As the soldier-statesman and labor-relations expert took hold of the reins, both business and labor acclaimed the skill and vigor of his administration. Although an absolutely regular party man, he remodeled the city government from top to bottom. Came the Second World War, and despite his two young sons, he resigned his mayoralty to become a lieutenant colonel, and a member of a favored general’s staff. He quickly became a statesman versed in Asiatic and European affairs and confidently predicted everything that happened.

A brigadier general, he returned to Ohio after the war and found himself the overwhelming choice for governor. For two terms he has been swept into office, his administration being as efficient as any business, as moral as any church, as warm-hearted as any family. His face is as honest as any business executive’s, his manner as sincere as any salesman’s; in fact, his is something of both, with a touch of grimness and homely geniality all his own. And all this comes through, magnetically, straight to you,  through the lens of any camera and the microphone as well.

/r/NonFictionBookClub just picked our next book, [*The Death of the Liberal Class*](http://www.amazon.com/Death-Liberal-Class-Chris-Hedges/dp/1568586795), by Chris Hedges, and I thought some of you folks might be interested in joining us to read it. The book argues that liberal institutions (universities, the press, the Liberal party, etc.) have failed to protect liberal values, and have essentially sold out the American public to a number of other interests.

Hedges is pretty (in fact intensely) Liberal, but there's plenty of reason to read him whether you share his views or not. He's an entertaining and generally pretty intelligent author; a fun read if you agree with him, no less enjoyable if you disagree, and enlightening either way.

Blurb from Amazon:

> *The Death of the Liberal Class* examines the failure of the liberal class to confront the rise of the corporate state and the consequences of a liberalism that has become profoundly bankrupted. Hedges argues there are five pillars of the liberal establishment — the press, liberal religious institutions, labor unions, universities and the Democratic Party — and that each of these institutions, more concerned with status and privilege than justice and progress, sold out the constituents they represented. In doing so, the liberal class has become irrelevant to society at large and ultimately the corporate power elite they once served.

Our first discussion will be of chapter 1, on Monday the 21st, and we'd love to have you join us. If you have trouble getting the book, I've uploaded a pdf on the sub.

I'm going to try to breakdown some aspects to the Iranian Nuclear deal. Not only as a citizen of the United States but as a citizen of the world, this deal will present the biggest threat not only to the United States but Israel and the rest of the western world. Taking the sanctions away that were put in place over 25 years ago has crippled Iran. Not to mention the President does not have the authority to solely take the sanctions away but of course our checks and balances system is a joke. But anyways by the deal going thru it gives Iran 100 Billion dollars to further fund their terroristic behavior as well as to continue to violate most human rights laws. The Obama administration claims that this deal will prevent a nuclear Iran but if you look at history and history loves to repeat itself in 1994 when Bill Clinton eased sanctions on North Korea despite the pleads our allies attempted to make he did it anyways. Within 6 years you had a nuclear ready North Korea. We have 4 American prisoners there that we WONT be getting back and not to mention the relief of sanctions would give relief to Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani, leader of the elite Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, who is a designated terrorist who is responsible for the deaths of at least 500 U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Not to mention we have them burning our flag and chanting ""Death to America"" and promise the destruction of Israel which is one of our closest allies in the region. So basically the United States will become the number 1 financier of Islamic terrorism in the word.

**1) The Internet.** The 2004 Howard Dean campaign showed that harnessing the power of the Internet-based discourse could be a formidable force. 2008 showed that it could launch a candidacy from the near-obscurity to viability. Americans have gone from obtaining political information from pretty much only the media (and limited social relations) to obtaining it from both the media and interactive natural discourse over the the Internet, via Facebook, reddit, other discussion forums, youtube, a host of preferred outlets and curators, etc. Yet as near as I can tell, the Sanders campaign is the only one so far this time around that is doing an okay job of tapping into these with some two-way communication,  medium-appropriate memes, and enthusiasm generation, and some of that is probably just the Ron Paul effect.

**2) Marketing and branding.** If 2008 showed us something, it's that a maximally-competitive political campaign machine revolves around a nexus of data-driven analysis, professionally-designed materials, clear messaging, and geographically and demographically tailored messaging. This obviously takes some money, so that rules out some candidates form doing this well, but that still leaves plenty of candidates who should be acting smartly when as near as I can tell, only Hillary Clinton has managed to produce campaign materials that look professionally done by modern marketing standards. Her logo is an arrow pointing in left to right, which is understood as the forward direction in our left-right-reading culture. Her announcement ad was perfectly crafted. Etc. Bernie's logo looks like crap. He obviously can't do a stylized B because that letter doesn't work as well for logos as a stylized O or H, but at least get those underlines, font thickness, and kerning under control!

**3) Alienation.** Ever since the people figured out that the Iraq War was based on lies, the main meta-issue in US politics has been the alienation of the voter from the actions of government. Howard Dean did so well because he ran on the Iraq War - It was an awful thing the government wanted but the people regretted. The Democratic Party was as a result kicked and dragged into almost sort of opposing it. In 2008, Obama ran against alienation (which had ballooned to monstrous proportions in the wake of Bush's unpopular actions) in a more direct fashion by offering its antidote, hope, though he was unable to satisfy its promise. The Tea Party was brought into existence and somewhat managed to escape its semi-astroturfed roots because it tapped into the alienation of the American people. Who can respond to alienation this time around? Sanders (and Warren, who seems not to be running) have supplied a diagnosis, but to my knowledge the other candidates don't seem to be addressing this. The Republicans offer general agitation but everybody sees through that now. Hillary Clinton offers championship, but that is what Obama represented in 2008 and it is unclear whether people are willing to trust another such offer.

**4) Credibility.** Being able to prove that you were against something bad or for something good at the time of its deciding provided a boost to candidates in 2004 and 2008, most notably with regard to the Iraq War. Who has that in this election? Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders do (to some extent, not absolutely), by virtue of being ideologically consistent, the same thing which marks them as fringe candidates in the eyes of elites. Hillary Clinton doesn't, mostly because political pragmatism over a long duration inevitably yields inconsistency. If there are others who have it, they have not made it a centerpiece of their campaign, although Lincoln Chafee may try to run on it.


What's the deal then? The Democrats I haven't mentioned who have not yet jumped into the race (probably because there is still some belief among elites that this will be a coronation, even though they are likely mistaken) seem to be absent on these fronts as well. Am I a political genius to see this where most of these candidates don't? No. Are most of the campaign strategists for these candidates maybe not the sharpest bulbs in the bunch? I think that's probably it.

elites,politicaldiscussion,"Fear has always been the basis of politics and social manipulation. There is no change on the horizon, and we keep falling for the same old tricks.","The modern nation state is a much a mental state of being as a physical one. The global world we live in means that we no longer, for the most part, form states based solely on ethnicity or religion. Furthermore, the new global age has forced citizens of countries which were originally founded by migrants (or invaders, depending on your point of view) such as; Australia and the United States (US) to face the undeniable truth that a common European descent does not a cohesive identity make. Therefore, as this realisation begins to dawn upon many of us, society is beginning to fracture into subgroups based on ethnicity, religion or social ideals.

Politicians and the social elite have been quick to pick up upon this drift toward societies’ new self-imposed segregation, and ultimate disintegration, and they have responded emphatically. Their response has been to bring society back to its primordial roots. Their response was to bring back fear. Fear of your neighbor. Fear of the other. Fear of the unknown.

The Old School of Social Control

For hundreds of years, modern societies have been manipulated, controlled and coerced, by governments and regimes that have started and entered wars in order to create a sense of social cohesion and eliminate those that dissent. In fact, on the eve of America’s entry into World War I, the social critic Randolph Bourne observed that ‘war is the health of the state’. He went on to say that war,

‘Automatically sets in motion throughout society those irresistible forces for uniformity, for passionate cooperation with the Government in coercing into obedience the minority groups and individuals which lack the larger herd sense… Other values such as artistic creation, knowledge, reason, beauty, the enhancement of life, are instantly and almost unanimously sacrificed, and the significant classes who have constituted themselves the amateur agents of the State are engaged not only in sacrificing these values for themselves but in coercing all other persons into sacrificing them.’

The Ruling Doldrums

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, we lost the common enemy. The western world was no longer in a constant state of war and fear. Our governments had lost their ability to repress the values of ‘artistic creation, knowledge, reason, beauty and the enhancement of life’. In addition, the invention of the internet and the unstoppable march of mass migration, meant that these values could be spread with astonishing ease and speed.

This was a worrying time for politicians, for values were changing, as western society shook itself out of its psychotic daze, it began to realize that it had been conned. The hate and fear of the communist era had given way to the sense of shame you feel after you have fallen for a sub-standard prank. Thankfully, this shame quickly gave way to an overwhelming sense of optimism. The nineties were a time in which social mobility was at its peak. People truly felt that anything was possible, and demanded fairness and pragmatism from their governments.

This was a horrible time to be a politician. People were educated and educated people subscribed to the values mentioned by our friend Randolph Bourne. The problem with these values however, is the fact that they inevitably lead to society questioning the merits of democracy, in that modern democracy is essentially a lesson in totalitarianism. In addition, for the first time in the history of democracy, there was no longer an enemy. We could no longer blame the failings of our increasingly totalitarian societies on necessity. We could no longer justify the unjustifiable through fear. For the first time in its modern history, democracy was failing.

Bring Back the Fear!

Thankfully for the ruling elite, a common is enemy is but one manufactured crisis away. Thankfully for the ruling elite, humankind appears not to know what to do with itself when there is no fear, no common enemy, no way to justify our irrational fears and hatred through some arbitrary and contrived common enemy. So that is exactly what happened. The west manufactured a crises i.e. weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, invaded a nation, and made an enemy of the entire Islamic world.

The real tragedy of this situation is our willingness to buy into it. We had such an amazing opportunity after the fall of the Soviet Union, to create a new world, to forge a new era where we embrace artistic creation, knowledge, reason, beauty and the enhancement of life. However, we as a species couldn’t handle it. We couldn’t accept this burden. Sure, most of us were lied to and manipulated, but we should have seen through the thin veil of deceit. I think we were happy to be deceived, happy to once again have a justification for our irrational dislike of other people and other cultures, happy to no longer have to question the value of democracy, happy to once again have a need for a totalitarian society. Islam became the enemy and war made our states healthy once again.

We are now stuck with a long and drawn out war in the Middle East that has no hope of ending in the near future. All I can ask is that the next time we are presented with an opportunity for peace, we do not shirk at our responsibility to remove the psychotic state of fear and hate that defines a modern democracy.",43,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2vdwfk/fear_has_always_been_the_basis_of_politics_and/,1423543935.0,2vdwfk
elites,politicaldiscussion,The end of cultural globalization and the international rise of the right wing?,"It seems like there has been a resurgence of right wing and ultranationalist sentiment all over the world:

- The Tea Party movement in the United States is opposed to increasing federal consolidation of power and ongoing national demographic shifts. 

- Europe has had a resurgence of anti-EU and anti-immigrant parties

- Russian nationalism is on the rise and Putin is as popular as ever for winning back slivers of old Soviet territory

- Islamist insurgencies have been tearing the Middle East apart ever since the Arab Spring, and it's getting even worse

- The hawkish Israeli right wing almost completely dominates Israeli politics

- Right wing parties advocating Hindutva nationalism triumphed in the recent Indian elections, and tensions with Pakistan and Bangladesh are growing

- The Chinese CCCP promotes Chinese nationalism centered around anti-Japanese sentiment to direct anger away from the Party during times of economic hardship. The Chinese leadership is also becoming more militarily assertive itself, making enemies of nearly all the neighboring countries

- Shinzo Abe wants to revoke article 9 of the Japanese constitution and rebuild the military, and most of the Japanese elite seems to agree

- Anti-Chinese sentiment is rising in Southeast Asia in response to maritime disputes

Is this all overhyped or is globalization actually dying out?

elites,politicaldiscussion,Who Rules.,"I read [this](https://www.princeton.edu/~mgilens/Gilens%20homepage%20materials/Gilens%20and%20Page/Gilens%20and%20Page%202014-Testing%20Theories%203-7-14.pdf) study recently.  Although it has weaknesses, it is certainly an interesting read.

I found some of the more interesting points to be subtle.  Here's one: the top 10% of the population, according to income, is very highly correlated with the true elite (r^2 = 0.91) versus the general population (r^2 = 0.67).  And here's another: business-oriented groups wield more power than do mass-oriented groups (e.g.  unions), but *not* because of power differential between either side; rather business-oriented groups simply more numerous, by a factor of two.

This report does not show us its data, so it's difficult to analyze fully.  Depending on what specific data points were measured, one could certainly create a study to support whatever hypothesis one wished.  However, the study seems fairly robust, given the sheer volume of policies that it examined.

I'll cut to the chase with it's findings:

>*What do our findings say about democracy in America? They certainly constitute troubling news for advocates of “populistic” democracy, who want governments to respond primarily or exclusively to the policy preferences of their citizens. In the United States, our
Gilens and Page Testing Theories of American Politics findings indicate, the majority does not rule -- at least not in the causal sense of actually determining policy outcomes. When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose. Moreover, because of the strong status quo bias
built into the U.S. political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favor policy change, they generally do not get it.*

So, I'm interested in thoughts about the study.  

What are some critiques?

Are the findings worthwhile; is it a robust study such that it paints an accurate picture of the current state of affairs in US politics?  

If the study is accurate, what does this entail?  In other words, is the current set-up generally net-positive or net-negative?",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/233y2f/who_rules/,1397583452.0,233y2f
elites,politicaldiscussion,Are right-wing libertarians underestimating the externalities?,"I often hear libertarians say things like ""I just want to be left alone, that's all"" or ""I want to mind my own business without anyone else interfering"" etc. But in a free capitalist market, these wishes will not come true.

The reason is that decisions made in the economy don't take place in an isolated bubble. The economy is interwoven; it's all-encompassing with transactions and decisions made that affect **everyone**. That's how it is today, and that's how it will be in a so-called ""free market"" You're not ""left alone"" in a capitalist society, you're part of an economy that affects all citizens. The wealthier people and corporations are, the more impact they can make in the economy (and therefore in other people's lives), so you are most certainly not going to be ""left alone"" by the financial elite and powerful corporations. 

[These externalities are all over the place](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBbdO-dO1Cs), and many of them are very dangerous: For example, if some very wealthy investors take huge risks which lead to a huge crash that spreads to the national or global market, then this will destroy the lives of many people who had absolutely nothing to do with the actions that caused the crash. Is that fair?

elites,politicaldiscussion,Because I wanna!,"Seems that our current administration can disregard facts, figures and the popular will or anything else that interferes with its’ agenda.

This mornings’ announcement by the EPA makes the point completely.  

The edict issued today as a new “regulation” has been roundly decried as draconian to the entire coal industry. It requires the capture of 40% of greenhouse emissions something that is not only hugely expensive but of questionable necessity.  Even though the science behind climate change is sketchy at best the administration has made its’ green attacks part of their hoped for legacy.  It totally disregards the economic impact, the additional unemployment, the additional government subsidies necessary for those citizens displaced when large segments of the coal industry are shut down due to the overwhelming expense of complying for the new regulations.    

The tactic is designed to foster green energy as a replacement mechanism for the lost coal production that will follow.  The question and the point are the same.  What green energy?  Wind energy costs more than it is worth.  Solar is a joke. Nuclear is already disallowed. Oil extraction by fracking has many road blocks (read New York), electric cars although gaining some traction are a long way from being accepted.  

The economy is just limping along and does not need another blow.  Anything that even hints at the lose of jobs and reduction of inexpensive fuel production is not only counter productive but fool hardy.  The administration gives lip service to so many noble positions and then does just the opposite.  These types of actions are nothing more that agenda driven.  You are witnessing the mature progressive movement at work.  Since the time of Teddy Roosevelt the methodology, the tactics, the infrastructure of these extremely liberal activists has been honed to perfection.  One must ask how a community organizer from Chicago first achieves a Senate seat with so little experience and then a short three years later catapults to the highest office in the land?  

A black man with a Muslim name from a notorious city becomes the darling of the left and is immediately protected vigilantly by the main stream media and Hollywood elites.  He builds a formidable grassroots machine (again a Chicago community organizer at work) made up of impressionable young people, a large contingent of labor unions not to mention the African American voting  block and takes the Presidency with relative ease.  Don’t forget he snatched the nomination from Hilary, an political progressive icon in her own right.  One has to admit that his ascendancy was a major phenomenon.  If you doubt the power of this movement study look no further than the White House.

The one thing that Mr. Obama has lived up to is that he was going to transform America. 
That he surely has done and in my opinion not for the better.

Obamacare is just over the horizon.  Even one of the creators of this massive debacle has disclaimed it as a coming “train wreck.”  Americans have yet to learn the hidden aspects in terms of taxes and costs that they will be forced to bare.  Once the Affordable Care Act is in force the bureaucracy to operate it will be become so huge, and thereby a voting block, it will never be able to be dismantled.

Five plus years into his administration President Obama still blames his predecessor for every issue his administration faces – the middle east, the economy, unemployment, climate change, etc. Folks on the left side of the aisle labeled Pres 43 with a mantle akin to the great Satan.  Even so, that does not excuse the inability of the current occupant of the office to have an impact.  The middle east is still on fire.  We have abdicated our role as world leader to a Russian despot who is now a statesman that we have chosen to follow.  How sad.  The economy is barely growing at a miserable 1 ½ %, unemployment is still above 7% with a truer figure being around 12 or 14% when you add back in those who have stopped looking for work.

The Chicago roots of this administration cannot be overlooked.  People who disagree or those proposing an opposing point of view are derided, attacked, labeled as mean spirited in the kindest and racist in the most extreme.  Yet there are many instances of duplicity in the Executive branch and those who work directly for the West Wing. Major Hassens’ attack at Fort Hood is “workplace violence” because it is PC not because it was true, Attorney General Eric Holder commits contempt of Congress and is immediately placed under the protection of the President via executive order, the IRS stymies conservative groups from organizing in time to affect the 2012 election, Administration stonewalls on who was responsible for the death of Ambassador Stevens in Benghazi, the Boston marathon bombers were successful because of incompetence of our Janet Napolitano and Homeland Security.  The point is that the rhetoric does not match reality.

Naiveté would be to expect any politician, let alone the President, to take responsibility for anything, credit yes, responsibility no.  That, does not however, absolve the American people from turning a blind eye to the monumental impact of the things happening in our country today.  Be cautious America you may not be able to reverse the damage.  Be very very careful with what you will allow.  

Government by fiat was not what the founders intended.

I am not sure if I fully understand what this theory is about.

elites,politicaldiscussion,Question For libertarians...,"Not trolling, I promise. I would just like to hear the logic behind it and a rebuttal.

While I agree with almost all of the LP's views on social issue, I cannot see any chance of voting for them based on their platforms for education and the governments role in big business. Specifically, I would like someone to explain to me how the free-market system is supposed to provide better education for everyone, and how free market will bring COG down for vital necessities like power, gasoline, etc. 

When the power companies were privatized under Clinton, it was sold to the american people as a cost saving measure, that would drop everybody's bill by lowering energy rates. This was a falsehood. If we expand this strategy to the few vital industries that are still well regulated (i know a lot of you will take exception to ""well"", but bear with me""), how can we honestly expect a different result?

As far as education goes, applying a free market model to the education system will lead to a society where education is only available to a few rich elite. There would be no incentive for anyone to go to poor, rural, or inner city schools at any level because they won't have the money to pay teachers in competition with districts peopled by more affluent families. The children from the under-privileged districts would not have the means to transfer to a better district, or the money to pay for it, so they would be relegated to shitty schools. This in turn would relegate them to little or no college, low paying jobs, keeping them in the areas they grew up in (or an area similar), and thus dooming their children to the same fate.

Again, I am not trolling, but I have never had an intelligent discussion with someone who could rebut this with logic and evidence (not just screaming and Ron Paul posts...)

elites,politicaldiscussion,Did you know that right now there's a ratified Constitutional amendment that government doesn't recognize as having been ratified?,"Recognize the constitutional amendment known as “Article the First” as having been ratified. 

Yes, a part of the Bill of Rights isn’t being recognized by the U.S. government as being part of the Constitution. 

The Founding Fathers foresaw population growth and the potential for corruption in the government. They knew that for a people to be free that they must govern themselves. Therefore they crafted and ratified Article the First to cap the size of a congressional district to 50,000. 

Background: 

The first ten amendments to the Constitution, collectively known as the “Bill of Rights,” originally contained twelve articles. The second amendment was officially ratified in 1992 after laying dormant for 203 years since its proposal in 1789. 

Article the First was not known to be ratified until 2012, when the ratification paperwork from Connecticut and Kentucky were discovered. It has been ratified by the constitutionally manded two thirds of states, it just isn’t being recognized. 



Effect:

The effect of recognizing and honoring the ratification of Article the First would provide great benefits to We the People...

* The House of Representatives would be forced to increase in size from the current arbitrary number of 435 to over 6,100. 
* Our representatives would actually represent us. 
* Gerrymandering congressional districts would be a thing of the past. 
* Special interest groups and lobbyists would not be able to afford buy off enough congress members to make a difference. 
* We would actually know our representatives personally. 
* Third party candidates would be viable, therefore breaking the two-party gridlock. 
* The average citizen would be able to run for congress to create a government by, for, and of The People. 

The elite few who are in Congress now will not recognize the legitimacy of this amendment, for to do so would cost them power. However, they’re not there to concern themselves with power. Their job is to represent us. 

How can 435 men and women represent 313.9 million Americans? They cannot. 

Recognize the ratification of article the first and cap the size of congressional districts to 50,000. It’s our constitutional right. 

Article: 

*Article the first... After the first enumeration required by the first article of the Constitution, there shall be one Representative for every thirty thousand, until the number shall amount to one hundred; after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall be not less than one hundred Representatives, nor less than one Representative for every forty thousand persons, until the number of Representatives shall amount to two hundred; after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall not be less than two hundred Representatives, nor less than one Representative for every fifty thousand persons.*

I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but one of the major reasons liberals voted for him was because they hated Bush's violations of civil liberties. And here you have Obama defending a program that Bush would have been proud of. Add to that the drones controversy, and the favorable treatment to Wall St banks. I'm sure someone else could do a better job of demonstrating his hypocrisy. But my point is, what you vote for is not what you get. It was the same deal with Bush, who ran on an anti-nation building ticket. Why believe anything a  political candidate promises? Once the election is over, they can forget about you, because they have much more powerful interests to please - the military industry, wall st, the 1%, etc. 

So is voting useless? I believe it is, whenever you're trying to change something the establishment doesn't want to change. For example, even though many people want universal health care, the establishment will throw everything they got at it, propaganda and all, to ensure their continued profits (as with Obamacare). It is an illusion that we the people are in charge, electing politicians to serve us. In reality, the moneyed elite is in charge, and elections make this situation seem legitimate.

I don't want that to happen, but I along with a vast majority of my Fellow Americans (used your Political Speak) have to demand better and get the USA back to what it was all about, the People, not the Gov't.

One last thing, I was genuinely scared to post this because I'm 100% sure I will be targeted and labeled as a 'terrorist' by the Gov't run by the Obama Administration.  But if no citizen has the courage to stand up and say what needs to be said, then a true Revolution can never get started.  I don't consider myself important, but I feel it important enough to start the discussion that needs to be had by all of the Citizens of the United States.

Thank you for reading.  I would appreciate some level headed, and thoughtful discussion.  I know that's a Pipe Dream, but I can at least hope.

sheep,politicaldiscussion,Would my mates political views stand,"could be the wrong place to post this, Bit of a read but someone i work with is trying to launch this but thinks it may not go anywhere but you got to try sometimes. some i think makes sense and could work but what do people think ? show some support maybe haha

Policy 1: Raising minimum wage to reduce benefits bill.
The minimum wage shall be raised to 9 pounds an hour, reflecting a full time salary of 18720 pounds annually. This will raise most working people to a level of income where they are able to pay their own way in the world, without need of state subsidy. This will let people who work full time jobs to earn enough to live on, which should be a basic right….companies will be upset at the imposition, but I believe it reflects the current cost of living, and that is the minimum fair salary.
People who are on low incomes but do not claim benefits will be significantly better off, enabling them to spend the extra money shopping, fuelling local economies, saving for purchasing a property or just having a holiday somewhere nice. It will make all of us except business owners better off, and they should see an increase in revenues as more cash is available to people who actually spend it.

Policy 2: Reduction in taxes on business.
Tax on business is necessary to some degree, but overdoing it makes Britain uncompetitive with the rest of the world. In order to attract new business to the UK and to make up for the shortfall in profitability from the rise in minimum wage, rates will be lowered significantly, although all companies operating in the UK will be obliged to follow some tighter tax regulations for this smaller amount (Amazon and Starbucks’ current practises will not be tolerated, if you want to be here, you contribute, if you don’t contribute, we will kick you out).
This will be accompanied by a drive to foster relations between the British government and large foreign companies and British companies who have moved overseas, with the aim of bringing a large number of new, good jobs to the people. There are too many people currently working jobs for which they are shockingly overqualified, and it is a waste that I would hope to end, giving people a chance to reach their potential and to make Britain significantly wealthier.

Policy 3: Increasing Government income from sources other than taxation:
At present we are taxing just about everything that we can, about as much as can be gotten away with. There are no remaining viable sources to tax within the current system and we need to raise more capital to pay down the national debt, currently standing at about 18000 pounds for every man, woman and child in the country should we have a whip round.
Thus we must create new sources of income and reduce spending where possible. At present we spend billions trying to fight a war on drugs that we are losing so badly that the time to surrender has clearly arrived. Much as prohibition in America in the early 20th century resulted in most of the gang problems they have today, our own cities are being infested by criminal gangs, making a fortune trading in illegal drugs. Without this income, the gangs will fall apart or become far more noticeable in their activities and easier to arrest.
So, what if the British Government took over production of the nation’s drug habit? It would solve the first problem of depriving the gangs of income by simply undercutting them and providing a regulated, clean product to the users, saving lives and NHS funds. It would raise enough money to start paying off the debt. Now I am not in favour of people doing cocaine and heroin and so forth, but if their bad habits were paying off the debt rather than funding gun violence on our streets, wouldn’t that be better? They are doing it anyway, and all evidence (ref: Portugal) shows that legalisation works better than prosecution in reducing national drug problems.
The product could be sold in licensed shops and clubs, the profits straight into government coffers.
Crimes committed whilst on drugs would still be prosecutable, as are crimes committed whilst drunk. Mugging people to feed a habit or getting coked up and shooting up the off license will still get you straight into one of Her Majesty’s Prisons.

Policy 5: The vast reduction of centralised exams in schools.
People have been complaining of a decline in education in this country for some time. For some time the amount of testing has increased, SATs, AS Levels, etc.
If you think about it, our kids spend one term each year with exams revising for them. So that’s the Year 2 SATs, the Year 6 SATs, the Year 9 SATs, their GCSEs in year 10, their GCSEs in year 11, AS levels in Year 12 and A levels in Year 13. That totals seven terms spent relearning old information, that if only partly remembered and needed later in life, can be Googled. That’s over two years of education time down the toilet. You could learn how to navigate by the stars or how to be a carpenter or gain a hugely wide understanding of our species history in that time…should be more useful to our kids than SATs are.
A Levels will remain, and internal school testing, assignment grades and so forth will be compiled to give a score from the school in each subject. It will be similar to the American GPA system. This way 2 years of extra education can be given to children.

Policy 6: Liberty and Freedom.
For at least the duration of the last Labour administration, we have been told that we need to be afraid of terrorism, afraid of muggers and knives and guns and WMDs and beards and all kinds of other nonsense. We live in one of the safest countries on Earth. The 7/7 bombings were a tragedy. It was USED by our politicians to take freedoms away from us. Every time we were told it would only be used against terrorists but time and time again we hear that anti-terrorism legislation has been used against persons who were in no reasonable way considered terrorists. Stop and search tactics, the fact that ID cards were even considered, detention without trial, closed trials, juryless trials; we cannot stand idly by while the things that make Britain civilised, the things that our ancestors fought and died to protect, are taken from us by some fool in the House of Commons.
A team will be set to look through all legislation passed by parliament for the last 30 years, rooting out anything that impinges on the rights of the people. It will be amended, deleted or overruled with new legislation. A set of rules governing any future attempt to deprive the British people of their liberties will be created. It will be considered treason to do so and the government immediately closed and an election called. The party leader responsible for trying to take freedoms from you will be tried and imprisoned if found guilty.

Policy 7: The EU, how should we proceed?
Leaving the EU is foolish. At present we have a vote in how things are done, can veto those we really don’t like and are one of the more powerful member states at the negotiating table. To leave would mean paying almost as much as we currently do, in fees to be part of the free trading block, but would lose us this power. So, what do we do when we are constantly finding ourselves frustrated with our European neighbours? Well, for one we could use the veto more often to drive for better deals for Britain. Secondly we can ignore them occasionally and ask Germany and France if they’re really prepared to stump up the extra cash needed if we leave.
Basically my view is that the British Government exists to serve the British people, and that means getting them the best deal every time, and if that irritates the Europeans, so be it.

Policy 8: Immigration.
At present there are more unemployed people than jobs and more people than houses in most of the country. So we should not look to increase our population for a while. Immigration to this country will be restricted to persons able to take care of themselves. Access to benefits, free healthcare, education and other public services will require a British Passport or Birth Certificate. Foreigners who want to come here and contribute are welcome; those who come to scrounge from an overstrained system can go hungry until they go home. Unfortunately it is impossible to prevent nationals of other EU states coming here if they want to, but we can make them not want to come in the first place.

Policy 9: Landfill, recycling and energy.
I think we can all agree that continuing to rely on fossil fuels until the bitter end is folly. They are harming our environment, filling our air with carcinogenic filth and cost an ever increasing fortune.
Technology exists such that a road can be built of solar panels, generating more than enough power to fuel Britain should we convert all our roads. They are built from landfill garbage, are able to serve as the national grid and provide much easier access to facilities underneath (gas lines and such). Road markings can be changed and turned on or off from a single central command centre.
I intend to roll out a small number of these, starting in the sunniest part of the country, and use the income from electricity sold to fund the construction of the rest. This is not only a fairly low cost program, but it will in time provide a source of income for the government and allow Britain to have one of the lowest energy costs in the world. It will also clean up the air as we stop needing to burn so much coal, stop the sheep from glowing in the dark as we close nuclear reactors, create thousands of construction jobs and allow us to dig up a lot of our old landfill sites and rejuvenate those areas.

Policy 10: No war.
War is fairly pointless. A bunch of people die and a few years down the line the reason the war was fought doesn’t even matter anymore. Iraq and Afghanistan won us no friends in the world, were probably the reason why 7/7 happened (look at how many bombs we drop on them, a handful coming back our way is a drop in the ocean by comparison). Our involvement in Libya probably won’t result in a decent government there and frankly I am tired of seeing our young men sent off to die in the sand for no good reason.
I intend to send diplomats to all the countries currently not on our best buddy list. I intend to sign treaties and set up trade agreements to tie our futures together, to make us dependent on them and them dependent on us for a mutually improved way of life to continue. This is how wars are prevented. We did it with France with the Entente Cordiale over a century ago, with Germany and the EU and we shall do it in 2015 with the Middle East and seek to end a war that has been going on in stops and starts since before we have records. For over 3000 years East and West have been killing each other in the names of gods that nobody worships anymore, that are of no consequence to anyone today. Why are we still doing it? They have a way of doing things that is different to ours, and we have to learn to respect that as they have to respect our way of life if there is any hope of ending this shameful conflict.
The only circumstances in which Britain will go to war are:
-attack on the nation, or its territories, by another (i.e. The Falkland Islands)
-in defence of an ally as set out in a standing treaty (i.e. NATO countries)

sheep,politicaldiscussion,what are your thoughts regarding the current candidates. is this just a battle of lesser evils? (or) change needs a catalyst; we need a tyrant to wake people up!,"looking over everyone's policies, it seems like no one running for president has any fucking idea what they're doing. i'm no expert, but here's the impression that i'm getting... feel free to educate my stupid ass if you disagree:

okay, so i know this hardly even needs saying, but it appears the elections have nothing to do with the welfare of the country, or even the merits of anyone's alleged intentions. it's just a personality contest. Whoever puts on the nicest face and promises us the biggest toys gets to sit in the oval office with their finger on the boohoo button. every 4 years it feels like reality grows a step closer to that satire where candidates are literally clones of each other with differing views only on things of no consequence (see futurama).

am i the only who thinks none of the current candidates are going to have any positive impact on the state of the economy? maybe i'm being pessimistic, but it looks like a battle of lesser evils from where i sit. How could this happen? How could we get to a point where we encourage those unfit to lead, to-- to lead us? is it media bias? brainwashing? i have a feeling faux news is largely to blame here. whenever anything positive comes along, someone pays a lot of money to scare the public away from it. it's worse than simply a case of us being screwed over by the government, we're being tricked into doing this to ourselves!

is democracy really this vulnerable to those with deep pockets? we're so easily swayed by the opinions of others. i get that we're sheep, that we follow by nature, but this feels like a joke. like we're living in some great satire, and the real world is behind the curtain. sure there are places to get the word on what's what, without agenda or bias (thank thor for reddit), but we're a minority. if the general opinion parrots that of the highest bidder, how will we ever vote for change? i mean REAL change! is this a lost cause, like arguing about logic with a bible thumper, or do you think that there is hope?

think about it. america sets the bar for the rest of the world. america does something, then everyone else says, 'oh, they're doing it, so it must be okay', or 'america's got this new thing! we should jump on the bandwagon!'. so it's not just america, whose future is in seriously peril. it's the whole freaking world economy.

like, what if there were some sort of catalyst? something that really shook people awake and made them realize, hey, i'm being lied to -- i'm being manipulated? i feel like that's really the only thing that'd work. like, if we had someone so obviously evil (like zero from code geass, or richard nixon, or -hey!- newt gingrich), that the world would snap out of it and start thinking for themselves.

sadly, even that probably won't happen. more likely our civilization will experience a slow decline, and there will be no single thing that's our undoing. and we'll just sit by and watch it happen, because our couches are so damn comfy.

And, the folks who are paying for the free  stuff want the free stuff to stop.  And the folks who are  getting the free stuff want even more free stuff on top of the free stuff they are already getting!

Now... the people who are  forcing the people who pay for the free stuff have told the people who  are RECEIVING the free stuff that the people who are PAYING for the  free stuff are being mean, prejudiced, and racist.

So... the  people who are GETTING the free stuff have been convinced they need to  hate the people who are paying for the free stuff by the people who  are forcing some people to pay for their free stuff and giving them the free stuff in the first place.

We have let the free stuff  giving go on for so long that there are now more people getting free stuff than paying for the free stuff. Now understand this. All  great democracies have committed financial suicide somewhere between  200 and 250 years after being founded. The reason? 

The voters  figured out they could vote themselves money from the treasury by  electing people who promised to give them money from the treasury in  exchange for electing them.

The United States officially became  a Republic in 1776, 231 years ago. The number of people now getting  free stuff outnumbers the people paying for the free stuff. We have  one chance to change that in 2012. Failure to change that spells the end of the United States as we know it.

brainwashed,politicaldiscussion,On the topic of brainwashing Americans,"TL;WR: With all the apathy on the internet about the new Internet bill the gov. is trying to pass, I believe we might be subject to some sort of brainwashing. and I wanna know what you guys think.

Let me premise this by saying that I'm not a conspiracy nut, I don't believe that the government puts subliminal messages in media telling us who to vote for, nor do I believe that there is an all powerful invisible hand of a company controlling the government or world events. 
However lately i've been noticing a couple of, for a lack of a better term, trends that seem unsettling to me. 
I first noticed it during the whole Edward Snowden fiasco where everyone got up in arms that the government were spying on regular citizens but not even in the first weeks or days of the news breaking was anybody mad enough to do anything other than complain on reddit (this includes me) I was as mad as anyone on here but I couldn't bring myself to do anything more than write an angry status on facebook, but I am generally a lazy person so I didnt think anything of it, never the less, I was shocked that no one was actually standing up to the government no one was protesting (at least non that I have heard of.) 
Then I started noticing Snowden and the whole ordeal with the NSA fall out of the limelight, the media wasnt reporting it anymore and people weren't talking about it, people just lost interest. Sure there were the monthly Actual advise mallard telling us to keep talking about the NSA and snowden but no one did. 
Now They are trying to bring back CISPA (or another Internet controlling bill, i'm not 100% on this) Regardless they are trying to pass it again and no one seems to be as angry this time around, I saw one meme and one political discussion on it sense I first heard about it, maybe im not looking hard enough, maybe ive missed them, but last time the internet was seven times much more proactive. So this is what leads me to wonder if there is some sort of mind control going on. Something like the government keeping us docile via the media telling us its all fine, or by other means, like distracting us from the issue they want us to stop talking about. I say this because, and this might just be me, but I really want to do something about all this. I really would like to go out and start a protest and create actual real change in this country, although I have not the slightest clue how I would do that, but thats a whole other political discussion. Still I cant seem to put anymore effort than writing this post. I feel like this might just be me, but I also doubt that. I want to know what people think and I wanna hear counter arguments. I just feel like you wouldn't know if you were being brainwashed or mind controlled and lord knows they at least have the potential and motivation to do something like this, what do you guys think?

brainwashed,politicaldiscussion,Could one motive for massive surveillance infrastructure build-up be cost-cutting scheme based on assumptions Americans won't pay higher taxes?,"Let me say first that I am NOT suggesting our government is NOT filled with control freaks drunk on their own power.

HOWEVER - it occurs to me that having a few number crunchers sitting at computers using small teams of law enforcement to carry out actions is probably a lot more cost-efficient than tens of thousands of law enforcement officers on the ground who need to be backed up with massive infrastructures.

I am not proposing this as a good thing by any means. One of my big problems with this country is the way the right has successfully brainwashed Americans into regarding taxes as some sort of super-villain that is the source of all evil. I think its disgraceful that politicians can only be elected if they promise to cut taxes.

But if our representatives are just running on the assumption that they have no choice but to continually find way to cut taxes, it strikes me as POSSIBLE that his surveillance infrastructure may be a major motivation for some of them to be supporting it.

This especially could hold true with House reps - ESPECIALLY the Tea Party types and Republicans but even Democrats too. They can count way more on being re-elected if they can promise 'no new taxes' or 'tax cuts'.

brainwashed,politicaldiscussion,Why I'm done with politics,"<rant>

So from 2005 to 2009, I spent my days in college studying political science, of which I now hold a bachelor's degree. From the time I was handed that diploma until now, I've realized one big thing. The American people at large don't give a shit about politics. They don't care about actually fixing things. They're stuck in the whole Republican vs. Democrat fight. It's not about making things better for our country, it's about beating the other side and rubbing it in their faces. They're so brainwashed that they literally believe the other side to be evil and their own side to be good. Politicians are chosen less for their skills and more for their looks and syntax. To top it all off, whenever it comes to light that the government is screwing over the American people, no one seems to care. Oh, Bush signed the PATRIOT Act? That's okay, because it'll put those damn dirty Democrats in their place. Oh, Obama renewed it? That's okay, because he's trustworthy enough to not abuse it. Just look at that smile! The NSA is spying on us? I don't care, Honey Boo Boo is on and I don't want to miss a minute.

It's a joke. American politics is all a big joke, and our rights and privacy are disappearing more and more each day, and no one seems to care, no matter how much people like me yell and wave our arms around. I've gotten to the point where I realize that no matter what I do or what I say, it won't make any difference in the long run. I'm done with politics. When we become the next China, I'm just going to say ""I told you so,"" and I'm going to enjoy each and every minute of your misery because you didn't fucking listen, and now you have to pay the price.

They concern me because it seems they are not easily converted.  Like they are brainwashed.  They feel very strongly about things which are not true, not even close to true.  We're not talking opinions, we're talking alternative versions of reality.  And they have violent undertones in some cases.  

They don't seem to want to work together, they don't want to have rational discourse, and they don't want anyone but them in power.  This is a dangerous combination, that if it goes unchecked for too long could end poorly in some kind of way.

He also knows that his policies, if enacted, will benefit the rich and totally fuck the poor, or if he DOESN'T know that, it's simply due to some mixture of willful and practiced personal denial combined with decades of intense right-wing brainwashing.  Only Paul Ryan himself knows his actual level of mental complicity in trying to advance these poisonous policies, but the only real question to derive from that is: Is he truly evil or merely functionally evil?

Sarah Palin was an embarrassment and her placement on a major political ticket was reckless beyond measure.  She was a babe in the woods.  She did not know ANYTHING, and even today, she's not much better.  She had to exit politics and try to cash in in other ways because she was simply too ignorant to ever be credible.  Smoke and mirrors can cover up a lot, but if you can never talk to the press about anything anywhere, then you've encountered a political limitation that just can't be surmounted.

This Ryan guy is a whole different animal.  He's had his flaps to be sure, but he is a capable politician.  He CAN survive conversations with the press, and if they're not vigilant, he can steer them.  And he is ably and knowingly putting forward an agenda that will do serious harm to most Americans.

To be clear: I don't think Ryan is a genius like so many on the Right like to maintain.  Credit where it's due, though:  He's much smarter and ultimately much more dangerous than Sarah Palin.  I strongly suspect that he is much more malevolent as well.  With Palin, one could at least put forth the defense that she doesn't really know what she's doing.  Ryan, however, has no excuses.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/11yeop/there_is_a_difference_between_paul_ryan_and_sarah/,1351012858.0,11yeop
agenda,politicaldiscussion,What happens when the pendulum swings back?,"On the eve of passing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), soon to be Speaker of the House John Boehner gave a speech voicing a political truism. He likened politics to a pendulum, opining that political policy pushed too far towards one partisan side or the other, inevitably swung back just as far in the opposite direction.

Obviously right-wing ideology is ascendant in current American politics. The President and Congress are pushing a massive bill of tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, while simultaneously cutting support for the most financially vulnerable in American society. American troops have been deployed on American soil for a ""riot"" that the local Governor, Mayor and Chief of Police all deny is happening. The wealthiest man in the world has been allowed to eliminate government funding and jobs for anything he deems ""waste"", without objective oversight.

And now today, while the President presides over a military parade dedicated to the 250th Anniversary of the United States Army, on his own birthday, millions of people have marched in thousands of locations across the country, in opposition to that Presidents priorities.

I seems obvious that the right-wing of American sociopolitical ideology is in power, and pushing hard for their agenda. If one of their former leaders is correct about the penulumatic effect of political realities, what happens next?

My understanding of free speech is that it's a universal, inalienable right -- in fact, the Declaration of Independence asserts the God-given nature of this fundamental freedom. If US policy was morally consistent, should it not be protected to the highest extent even for non-citizens? At the end of the day, if free speech is a human right, one's citizenship status should not give the government the ability to alienate that right. I understand that it's possible for non-citizens to promote an agenda among voters that is objectively against US interests...but that already happens on internet spaces, so it's quite literally impossible for the voting populace to be immune to foreign opinions on their politics.

The most prominent example being Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense, as well as Kristi Noem for Homeland Security, Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence, and Matt Gaetz for Attorney General.

Are the remaining senior-most officials of the departments going to become the de facto leaders, with the cabinet positions and the leaders they install being given the illusion of control?

agenda,politicaldiscussion,"House Republicans have unveiled their 2025 agenda. It includes a full endorsement of the Life At Conception Act, which would ban all abortions and IVF access nationwide, rolling back the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) and raising the Social Security retirement age. What are your thoughts on it?","It was created and is endorsed by the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest bloc of House Republicans that includes over 170 members including House Speaker Mike Johnson and his entire leadership team.

The Life at Conception Act is particularly notable because a state version of 'Life at Conception' is what led to the Alabama Supreme Court banning IVF a few weeks ago. Some analysts believe the Florida Supreme Court could try something similar soon. So it looks like Republicans could be using some of these states to sort of test run the perfect language they could then apply to a national ban.

Another interesting point is that Republicans are filing all these things under a 'budget' proposal. This could be because budgetary items can bypass the Senate Filibuster (the minority party veto that the GOP enjoy using when out of power). Special exemptions past it apply to budgets, so all they'd need to do is clear it with the Senate Parliamentarian and they could jam it home with 1-seat majorities in the House and Senate + Trump to sign. And if the parliamentarian says no, they can just fire and replace her with anyone they want. Republicans have a history of doing just this, most recently in 2001.

this is not me arguing in favor of certain actions of certain governments nor am I condemning certain protest movements around the world I'm simply asking questions about in what way the Media bias.

**The media**

The recent protesters in Cuba have gotten quite a lot of attention from the mass media. social media sites like twitter have pushed the protests in Cuba to the top of the news feed. But at the same time other important events don't receive the same degree of coverage by the media? Why?

There are currently several protesters happening around the world going on right now that get little to no attention at all. Some of these have been met by a much more violent response by the government then the protests in Cuba have been.

Here's just a few of them.

**Protests currently going on in South Africa**

>In South Africa, at least 32 people have been killed amid several days of clashes between police and protesters. On Monday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered soldiers to the country’s two most densely populated provinces, after crowds ransacked retail shops in Durban and Johannesburg. The protests began in response to the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma, who was charged with contempt of court for refusing to testify in a probe of high-level corruption. But the protests quickly refocused on poverty and growing economic inequality during the pandemic.

The Mass media seem to focus on certain protests and ignore others. The protests they tend to focus on are ones that are in line with the foreign policy interests of the United States government and the ones that get less attention are ones that either the US has no interests in or are actively not in favor of. Why did the protests that happened recently in Haiti or Colombia get ignored but others got plenty of attention?

**Edit:**

 I'm seeing a lot of the same responses of people saying basically that ""the news media is just meeting demand"".

But how could this be the case how exactly would the news media know what protests would be in demand before they even happen. The protests happen all around the world and are about different things.

if they are just meeting demand how do you explain the very real trend in favor of coverage of protests that the US government is in favor of.

Like take these examples for instance.

Coverage of the 2019-2020 protests of Iraq vs Iran.


The Iraq protests were  of a very large size and they were calling out things like State corruption, Unemployment, low wages as well as calling for an end to the US occupation of the country. They were met with severe state repression many protesters were killed by the government. The protests eventually called for the overthrow of the government of Iraq.


The protests in Iran were against Government corruption, Increase in fuel prices, Human rights Abuses, and opposition to the theocracy. They were also met with severe state repression and many protesters were killed by the government. The protests eventually called for the overthrow of the Iranian government.

The two protest movements were calling for much the same thing and These protests were going on at about the same time. The main difference is that the protests in Iraq were against the foreign policy interests of the US government and In Iran the US government was trying to do Regime change in the country.

The main stream media covered Iran far more then Iraq. The protests in Iraq were back page news but the Iranian protests were front page news.

Or that another example. the example of the main stream media coverage of the protests in Myanmar vs Haiti.

Both these protests were pro democracy movements fighting against an authoritarian government but the US was in favor of one movement (Myanmar) and against the other (Haiti).

The protests in Haiti were fighting against the authoritarian rule of the now dead President of Haiti Jovenel Moïse. Who illegally stayed one year past the time he was supposed to step down as President and have new elections. Jovenel Moïse. Ruled by decree for a whole year Haiti was effectively a dictatorship during that time. The US government supported Jovenel Moïse's clam to be the president of the country and didn't call out his Hunan rights violations.


The protests in Myanmar were fighting against a coup by the military against an elected government. The military claimed the elections to be rigged without any evidence and did and illegal coup against a newly elected government. The US denounced the coup and called for the military to respect democracy in the country.

It seems very unlikely to me that the media is just meeting demand for certain things as these news stories are very similar to each other and you would think that demand would be similar as well. 

When the US government is in favor of a protest movement the main stream media coverage of the events are more frequent but when the US government is against a protest movement (or neutral) the coverage is vary little or something even almost non existent.

It seems very unlikely that the mass media is just meeting demand because many of these events are very similar and you would think that the public would like both things to be covered. But they are not equally covered but it does seem like the mainstream media covers things when there are in the interests of the US governments foreign policy agenda.

However, more recently, Puerto Rican statehood has faced opposition from the Republican party. There seems to be a general assumption that Puerto Rico would be a blue state, although its unclear how accurate this assumption is (in fact the current non-voting member of the House of Representatives from Puerto Rico, Jenniffer González, is a Republican and a chair of Latinos for Trump). Nonetheless, Republicans have opposed Puerto Rican statehood on the basis of it providing Democrats with two additional Senators, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling it part of a 'socialist agenda' [in 2019](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article231677258.html) and in November 2020, the RNC released [a statement](https://www.gop.com/ossoff-and-warnock-are-too-extreme-for-georgia-rsr/) including Ossoff's support of Puerto Rican statehood as an example of his 'far-left agenda'.

Meanwhile on the Democratic side, party leadership including Joe Biden have supported Puerto Rican statehood. However, with such a narrow majority, they can't afford to lose a single Democratic vote and more conservative member Joe Manchin said in November about Puerto Rican statehood, [""Still not convinced that's the way to go. And I would say that with that I'm absolutely agreeing to sit down and listen to the debate. I don't believe that is the direction we should be going right now.""](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2011/10/nday.06.html)

Among the public, a [Washington Examiner/YouGov poll](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/more-support-statehood-for-dc-and-puerto-rico-washington-examiner-yougov-poll-finds) recently found that 61% of Americans supported Puerto Rico statehood with 27% opposed. Although among Republicans, the number flips with only 29% support and 61% opposed.

Some additional considerations: 

* Puerto Rico would become the 31st most populous state, just above Iowa, and would probably have four Representatives (which, given the cap on the House, would be taken from other states). 

* Puerto Rico is currently in a debt crisis, facing a 15 year economic depression, and is much poorer than the current poorest state (Mississippi) with 45% of its population below the poverty line, potentially causing Republicans to balk at the idea of bailing them out. 

* Puerto Rican statehood is often talked about in conjunction with DC statehood, which is much less popular. Could the linking of the two bring down support for PR?

* Alaskans might actually find allies in having another state that is not contiguously linked especially in regards to opposition to the Jones Act. Could that persuade Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan to support statehood for Puerto Rico?

Given all of the background and complications, with Democrats poised to take control of the Senate on January 20th will Puerto Rican statehood have a shot? Would all 50 Democratic senators hold the line and vote for it? Could 10 or more Republican senators support it as well?",62,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/krt8xk/is_puerto_rican_statehood_viable_in_a_democrat/,1609956056.0,krt8xk
agenda,politicaldiscussion,What is the worst a lame duck government has done?,"A lame-duck session of Congress in the United States occurs whenever one Congress meets after its successor is elected, but before the successor's term begins. The expression is now used not only for a special session called after a sine die adjournment, but also for any portion of a regular session that falls after an election. In current practice, any meeting of Congress after election day, but before the next Congress convenes the following January, is a lame-duck session.[1] Prior to 1933, when the 20th Amendment changed the dates of the congressional term, the last regular session of Congress was always a lame duck session.

Congress has held 16 lame-duck sessions since 1940. Recesses preceding lame-duck sessions have usually begun by mid-October, and typically lasted between one and two months. Congress typically reconvened in mid-November and adjourned before Christmas, so that the lame-duck session lasted about a month. Some recesses, however, have begun as early as August 7 or as late as November 3, and ended as early as November 8 or as late as December 31. Lame-duck sessions have ended as early as November 22 and as late as January 3, and have extended over as few as one, and as many as 145, calendar days.

Some lame-duck sessions have been held largely for pro forma reasons (e.g., 1948), on a standby basis (e.g., 1940, 1942), or to deal with a single specific matter (e.g., 1954, 1994, 1998). Some sessions, as well, have deferred major matters to the succeeding Congress (e.g., 1944, 1982, 2004), especially when a stronger majority for the same party was in prospect. Most, however, could be regarded as at least moderately productive. When the President has presented an extensive agenda to a lame-duck session controlled by his own party, it has often approved many of his recommendations (e.g., 1950, 2002, 2004), but when he has done so under conditions of divided government, he has had less success, and has often vetoed measures (e.g., 1970, 1974, 1982). Additionally, a major task of most lame-duck sessions in recent years has been to complete action on appropriations and the budget. In 1974, 1980, 1982, 2000, 2004, and 2012, this effort was at least somewhat successful, but in 1970 and 2002 a final resolution was largely left to the following Congress.

Lame-duck sessions do not usually occur in countries under a parliamentary form of government, whether the Westminster system or other models. Under a parliamentary system there are usually no fixed dates for elections or the beginning of terms, so that a new session of parliament will always begin with its first meeting after an election has been held. Often the previous parliament is dissolved by the head of state at the request of the head of government, therefore even in an emergency there is no parliament to call after the final session until the new parliament has been elected. In contrast to members of Congress who do wield their full authority until their term ends, the power of outgoing parliamentarians is limited by convention; any cabinet ministers that were members of the now dissolved parliament will serve in an ""acting"" or ""caretaker"" capacity (i.e. not being able to make important appointments nor policy declarations) until the new parliament convenes.",73,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/jj1qx4/what_is_the_worst_a_lame_duck_government_has_done/,1603807595.0,jj1qx4

What has been the cause of the recent Catholic shift of the Supreme Court? Should there be more religious diversity in nominations?","Catholic identification in the United States stands around 20%, as of 2020. However, it is likely soon that the supreme court will be (up to)* 66% Catholic. Does this matter? 

Identifies as Catholic:

1. As mentioned, Amy Coney Barret is a devout Catholic (trump appointment)
2. Samuel Alito (Bush appointment)
3. Brett Kavanaugh (Trump appointment)
4.  Clarence Thomas (Bush Sr. appointment)
**Although Thomas identified as protestant at the time of his appointment, however he has return to Catholicism
5. Sonia Sotomayor (Obama appointment)

raised Catholic*:

6. Neil Gorsuch (although now belongs to Episcopal Church)

To further drive this point home, the two previous judges that trump has replaced with Catholics, ... were also Catholic:

7. Anthony Kennedy (Reagan Appointment)
8. Antonin Scalia (Reagan Appointment)


... So why so many Catholics?

I couldn't find any religious demographics on lawyers quickly, is the profession dominated by Catholics or something?
Some ideas I had off the bat, devout christians would likely make opinions that favored the Republican agenda (i.e. abortion), and 7 of the justices I mentioned are all Republican picks. But why not other devout christians with similar views on abortion, such as evangelicals? What about the one Obama pick (sotomayor)?

Another is that Catholics are perhaps more racially diverse, and so satisfy a stronger diversity goal for presidents in making up the Court (achieved with  Thomas and Sotomayor)?

agenda,politicaldiscussion,In what ways are politics and public health related? How have recent political trends affected responses to global (or national) health crises?,"Many have defined the coronavirus as *the* public health challenge of our generation. Nations have developed differing responses to the disease considering their [unique political situations](https://news.umich.edu/politics-public-trust-drive-differing-responses-to-coronavirus/), infrastructural challenges, and economic circumstances. [Many researchers and commentators have already dedicated a significant amount of literature to comparing the responses of different nations](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-05-12/pandemic-chinas-sputnik-moment), [typically dividing them between more liberal versus more authoritarian systems.](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2020-05-07/democracies-have-edge-fighting-wars)

However, beyond just the coronavirus, to what extent are politics and public health related? For example, journalist Maryn McKenna explores this connection in [her 2019 New Republic piece](https://newrepublic.com/article/153264/rise-right-wing-nationalism-jeopardizing-world-health) that has come to renewed relevance considering recent calls for a more engaged multilateral public health framework. In it, she connects the international rise of nationalism to the growing skepticism of expertise that has undermined vaccination campaigns, public health efforts, and national responses to combating disease. It is not that difficult to connect this thesis with the [motives of ardent lockdown protestors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/us/politics/coronavirus-protests-trump.html) and the repercussions of their actions. (though I wouldn't assume that they are all nationalists or are all driven by right-wing motivations.)

This question is not limited to coronavirus responses, nor is it limited to the United States' response.

To what extent can public health efforts be coordinated internationally aside from organizations like the WHO? Or what additions/changes should we make to the WHO's framework? How have politics either enabled or hindered national public health responses, and to what extent can specific political movements impact national public health agendas?

freedom,politicaldiscussion,"How does the political accommodation of Amish communities challenge conventional ideas about modern governance, citizenship, and civic obligation?","Amish communities in the United States present a unique case of religious and cultural autonomy within a modern democratic state. Concentrated in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, the Amish are often exempt from certain civic norms due to religious beliefs — including compulsory education beyond 8th grade (Wisconsin v. Yoder), military service, and in some cases, even Social Security participation.

These exemptions are rarely controversial in their local settings, and most Americans accept them as reasonable accommodations for religious freedom. Yet the broader implications are complex:

* How do we reconcile the Amish’s limited participation in key civic obligations with expectations of equal citizenship?
* Would similar accommodations be politically feasible if claimed by other religious or cultural groups?
* Does the political tolerance extended to Amish communities reflect consistency in American pluralism, or selective acceptance due to their low-profile, insular nature?
* What does their political neutrality (many do not vote or serve in office) reveal about the American expectation of civic engagement?

The Amish example raises bigger questions: Is the American ideal of citizenship flexible enough to include those who opt out of major aspects of public life? Or does this accommodation depend on cultural familiarity and low perceived political threat?",14,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1lfgd5w/how_does_the_political_accommodation_of_amish/,1750353360.0,1lfgd5w

freedom,politicaldiscussion,"What all tactics are used to cause democratic backsliding by an authoritarian government, and how can they be resisted","[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic\_backsliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding)

Democratic backsliding is the process by which liberal democracies become less free and less democratic, and more authoritarian.

From what I know of it, its been happening a lot in the world lately, including the US. The US used to score 94/100 from Freedom house (who rates countries on freedom) and we are now at 83/100 due to Trumpism and the GOP takeover in the 2010 election which led to a lot of gerrymandering and voter suppression.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic\_backsliding\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding_in_the_United_States)

&#x200B;

>As part of their Freedom in the World survey series, Freedom House downgraded the United States's score significantly in their civil rights and political liberties index between 2010 (94) and 2020 (83), citing the need for 3 main reforms: removing barriers to voting, limiting the influence of money in politics, and establishing independent redistricting commissions

&#x200B;

So what all tactics lead to democratic backsliding, what tactics reverse it? I get the impression nations like Venezuela, Poland, the US, Israel, Hungary, Russia under Putin (potentially, I don't know if Russia was a free nation in the 90s), etc are good examples of democratic backsliding in the modern world. The rise of the Nazis under the Weimar republic in Germany is another extremely good example of this, probably one of the better examples, however I think modern democracies have more safeguards than the Weimar republic.

&#x200B;

Tactics I've seen are things like

&#x200B;

* Destroying the independence of the judicial branch
* Making the legislative branch ceremonial and powerless
* Putting all power into the executive branch
* Undermining the ability of the public to change the government by voting (rigging elections, voter disenfranchisement, etc)
* Disarming citizens who might rebel against the government
* Arming citizens who would protect the government (Venezuela armed their citizen supporters into militias while disarming everyone else, I believe).
* False flag attacks to justify more executive power, more military/police presence, and to unite popular support around the executive branch (The Russian Apartment bombings under Putin, the Reichstag fire under the Nazis for example).
* Purging the public sector of independent workers and people hostile to the executive branch, and replacing them with loyalists
* Undermining independent labor unions that either oppose the executive branch, or act independently of the government
* Banning other parties, or reducing them to token opposition
* Increasing the ability of the military, police and intelligence agencies to spy on the public

Here is a list of 11 laws the Nazis passed in 1933 and 1934 to convert the Weimar republic into a Nazi dictatorship.

* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

freedom,politicaldiscussion,"If a country has socialized healthcare, would it become acceptable for society to judge and/or regulate individual's health choices?","To be clear I don't really want to argue for/against the pros/cons of single payer on this thread, if you want that [there's already threads on that](https://old.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/search?q=universal+healthcare&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all). Rather I'd like to more narrowly explore the idea of the relationship between socialized healthcare and values like personal freedom, shared responsibility, etc.



Basically the crux of my question is as follows:

In  a country with private healthcare like the United States, if you see a person making negative health choices (smoking, eating junk food, etc.) most people will be fine with it due to ideals of personal freedom/responsibility, as well as the idea that the person in question would be paying for their bad choices themselves. 

Obviously this isn't 100% true since taxpayer funded healthcare exists in the US as well, but it is still more likely than not that the person paying for the bad choices will be them

However this would not be the case in a single payer healthcare scheme, since suddenly health services would be taxpayer funded. That would mean that if you see someone smoking or gorging down junk food, you suddenly *are* paying for their bad choices

So what options does that leave us?

1. Allowing complete personal freedom to be unhealthy while also covering the cost of this lifestyle with no judgement. Basically allowing people to have their cake and eat it too (literally in some cases)

2. Increased societal pressure. Basically allowing ""stop being so unhealthy, you're wasting my tax dollars"" to become an acceptable attitude

3. Some sort of pigouvian tax to make consumers of unhealthy products pay extra taxes towards the health system

4. Direct regulation of unhealthy behavior through bans or limitations

5. On the demand side, exclude specifically people with unhealthy lifestyles from public health insurance or force them to buy separate insurance addons

Which of these solutions would be your ideal if single payer was passed into law? I feel like in nations with a somewhat communitarian attitude it would be easy to go for one of the solutions between 2 and 5, but in a country like the US  where people constantly chafe at governmental or societal oversight it might be a tougher sell",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1cmt8ct/if_a_country_has_socialized_healthcare_would_it/,1715133899.0,1cmt8ct

freedom,politicaldiscussion,How to satisfy the demand for commodities in a communist country?,"It seems that in many examples of communist countries, it is the population's demand for commodities that causes a lot of issues within. 

I can see why the USSR overlooked this seemingly small but important demand with their main focus being on growing their military and metal industries with the Western countries threatening them at every turn. 

However even in modern communist countries with no real external threats other than strict embargos and sanctions, the deprival of commodities seem to be the driving factor for their title as ""poor"". All their food, water, medical and housing needs are met but still things like internet, luxury quality goods, technology obviously aren't as advanced as capitalist countries.

For most communist populations, although fundamental standard of living are met, witnessing capitalist countries elsewhere release their newest smartwatch and built-in Siri house, then looking back at their own standard of living means the gap between what's considered ""low-standard"" and what's considered ""developed"" seem to get further and further apart. This often leads to the introduction of some market freedom in order to improve some areas in quality of life.

But why can't they just instead invest in these areas while remaining fully communist? Is it really the embargos and sanctions that is preventing them? Why can't they just let capitalist countries unethically compete against each other to see who can invent the best air fryer while the communist countries just steal their patents and replicate some for themselves? Is it because the actual materials needed to create these products require so many resources only available through the western funded cobalt slave mines? But even if they can't produce some Apple Vision googles im sure they could self sustainably invest in advancing their electricity production and other technological things here and there.

I feel like this is the area where pro-capitalits mean when they say ""communism means everyone will be equally poor"" but if you're the one preventing some technologically advanced goods into the country then aren't they just the ones stagnating them?  

By the way im not a communist, although I would hopefully wish to eventually get there someday through trial and error so this is a big issue I would like to know how to address.

freedom,politicaldiscussion,Is the constitution still to debate nowadays ?,"Since the constitution is 236 years old, we could think it is not a subject up to debates anymore. It is a text highly protected that hasn’t been up to change since its application. Nonetheless, debates in the United states are still making the amendments their main subject.  
  
On September 29th the supreme court was given a case that is once again, creating fights over the first amendment. In fact, the states of Florida and Texas created laws that prohibited social media to ban people from their platform and especially politicians. These states are mostly under republicans’ authority and now, democrats are asking the supreme court to take the case and decide if it is still respecting the first amendment of the USA’s constitution.  
  
This situation creates new debates around the interpretation of the first amendment.  
  
Moreover, In 2021, this situation was already happening. After the election of 2020, Trump supporters came to the capitole to take over the monument encouraged by Donald Trump and the question of freedom of speech was once again the main subject. In fact, he had the freedom of speech to encourage his supporters. However, this event had many physical repercussions and damages. The question was then if it was still covered by the first amendment if his speech was creating violences.  
  
Donald Trump was after this event was taken in an impeachment trial but was released after his term ended. He was also banned from social media.  
  
Overall, recent situations are still creating debates over the constitution. Even if it’s really old, the constitution is always challenged by society's evolutions. Back in the days freedom of speech assured freedom of expressing opinion. Now that it is secured in the country, freedom of speech is challenged by new forms of expression through social media.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1872gfn/is_the_constitution_still_to_debate_nowadays/,1701298060.0,1872gfn
freedom,politicaldiscussion,"Is the strong religious sentiment that still prevails in the U.S. at the heart of ""culture wars"" and endless debates on subjects such as abortion and same-sex marriage?","  
Coined by J. Davison Hunter, the term ""culture war"" has resurfaced in the American political and cultural landscape in recent years. By this we mean conflicts between social groups struggling to impose their own virtues, beliefs and practices on society. These tensions crystallize around ""hot button"" topics, creating polarization in society.  
The United States, often described as a ""nation under God"", has a wide religious diversity, but Christianity exerts a significant influence. This predominance of Christianity has strongly shaped Americans' moral and ethical attitudes.   
Since the Supreme Court's decision to repeal the right to abortion from the Constitution in 2022, debate on the subject has resumed. Since the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, abortion has become one of the hottest topics in the culture wars. Supporters of abortion rights defend individual freedom and the right to choose, while opponents, the pro-life movement, often motivated by conservative religious convictions, see abortion as a violation of fundamental moral principles. The roots of this opposition can be traced back to religious beliefs that regard life as sacred from the moment of conception, fuelling a never-ending debate that divides American society.  
The debate over same-sex marriage has followed a similar trajectory. The Obergefell v. Hodges ruling in 2015, which legalized same-sex marriage on federal territory, was a watershed moment. However, religious arguments continue to oppose this recognition, viewing marriage as a sacred institution defined by specific religious norms. The persistent tension between those who see marriage as a civil right and those who see it through the prism of religious convictions is the subject of cultural tensions.   
The impact of these culture wars on American politics is undeniable. Political parties seek to mobilize their electoral base, often positioning themselves firmly on these divisive issues, thus contributing to political polarization. Religiosity becomes a common thread in the formation of public opinion, influencing the way voters evaluate candidates and parties.

freedom,politicaldiscussion,Social Media and News Consciously Uncouple,"I find news fascinating and most important in a society where freedom of speech is a right. News has affected the US elections......likely every US election. Social media was the epicenter of news during recent elections.

This recent [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/social-media-news-readership-decline/675890/) article really makes me think about what happens during an election year when interest in the news has waned in adults. 

Will most be inclined to do the research and look for the truth in oceans of information on candidates?

Is the break up of news and social media a good thing or not?

> “Because the first amendment is very broad. It includes not just a free speech right, but also a freedom of association right.

freedom,politicaldiscussion,How do we settle the anarchy-authority debate?,"On the political ~~compass~~~ multi-dimensional field, one direction points to anarchy and the other points to authority. 


There are several ways to label the opposite ends of the scale, besides anarchy and authority:


Free and Not Free
Individual and State
Lawless and Lawful


This is not a one dimensional issue, because freedom is taken away through the threat of violence, and violence exists in both state and stateless environments. Horseshoe theory applies the less ability one has in defending ones self.


One must ask, is your life truly free if there exists a threat on your life?


Thus the debate, what's the proper balance of power, between a person and the law, between person and their peer?


A person with no voice and power is subject to authoritarianism against the state and will find loss of freedom should there be a threat on his life.


Some examples to consider: 


The American Revolution
The French Revolution
The Haitian Revolution (and Haiti today)
The Narcos in Mexico today
The situation in Afghanistan today

Each of those scenarios have a seen a change in the quality of life of individuals, a change made possible by a difference in the balance of power within states, individuals, and other entities.",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/13gjq4h/how_do_we_settle_the_anarchyauthority_debate/,1683989891.0,13gjq4h
freedom,politicaldiscussion,Should the US Congress and state legislatures have the power to override parts of the Bill of Rights like in Canada?,"Like the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Canada also has a bill of rights known as the [***Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms). However, unlike the US Bill of Rights which are 100% absolute and inalienable insofar as how the judiciary interprets those rights, large parts of the Canadian Bill of Rights are subject to [**parliamentary supremacy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty) In order to obtain the political support necessary to enact a new formal constitution in 1982, [**Section 33 of the** ***Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_33_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms), also commonly known as the **notwithstanding clause**, authorizes Parliament or provincial legislatures to override sections 2 and 7 through 15 of the *Charter* with no legal limit. This means that by invoking this clause, they can freely enact any laws that violate the rights guaranteed in those sections and judicial review cannot stop them. All laws invoking this clause are only in force for up to five years but they could be renewed by their legislature any number of times.

In Canada, the rights that could legally be overridden include:

* Section 2 (fundamental freedoms): freedom of conscience, freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of belief, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and of other media of communication, freedom of peaceful assembly, and freedom of association
* Section 7: right to life, liberty, and security of the person
* Section 8: freedom from unreasonable search and seizure
* Section 9: freedom from arbitrary detention or imprisonment
* Section 10: right to legal counsel and the guarantee of habeas corpus
* Section 11: rights in criminal and penal matters such as the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
* Section 12: right not to be subject to cruel and unusual punishment
* Section 13: rights against self-incrimination
* Section 14: right to an interpreter in a court proceeding
* Section 15: equal treatment before and under the law, and equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination

Although the Canadian federal government has never invoked this clause, it has been used at the provincial level multiple times in the last 40 years especially by Quebec. For example, the Superior Court of Quebec stated that Quebec's [Bill 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_respecting_the_laicity_of_the_State) violates freedom of expression and freedom of religion but had to uphold it since the notwithstanding clause was explicitly invoked.

freedom,politicaldiscussion,US under the Articles vs. EU: Is the EU a confederation or not? Or is it more than that?,"It has been sometimes alluded to that the current EU resembles the US under the Articles of Confederation. While I'm not an expert on the Confederation period of the US, the comparison does intrigue me.

**Constitutionality**

The US Confederation articles are described as the first written constitution of the US, although by the content and looks of it, it resembles more an international treaty between sovereign states in some sections. It needed ratification by all member states and explicitly mentions the protection of sovereignty of member states.

>(Art. 2) Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated.  
>  
>(Art. 3) The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever.  
>  
>(US Articles of Confederation)

Meanwhile in the EU: The drafting of a European consitition was finalized in 2004 under the ""Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe"" but rejected during ratification in important member states and therefore the project was aborted halfway through.

But the current active founding treaties of the EU basically have ""constitutional character"" (that's at least what legal scholars have been saying, whatever that means) if you compare them to the Articles of Confederation:

>(Art. 1 TEU)  
>  
>By this Treaty, the HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES establish among themselves a EUROPEAN UNION, hereinafter called ‘the Union’, on which the Member States confer competences to attain objectives they have in common.  
>  
>This Treaty marks a new stage in the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen.

""ever closer union among peoples of Europe"" is the phrase used in the EU treaties and the explenations and goals are very similar to what the AoC have stated for the US.

>(Art. 5 TEU)  
>  
>1. The limits of Union competences are governed by the principle of conferral. The use of Union competences is governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.  
>  
>2.   Under the principle of conferral, the Union shall act only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by the Member States in the Treaties to attain the objectives set out therein. Competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States.

Art. 5 TEU is basically Article 2 of the US AoC.

Articles 13 TEU and the following are laying out the structure and functioning of political institutions, just like Articles 5, 9 and 10 of the AoC for the US.

So where then is the line between ""a true constitution"" and things of ""constitutional character""? If the ""constitutional character"" is already so close to historic confederations, why don't we call the EU a true confederation yet?

**Power comparison**

The EU treaty mentions foreign representation of the Union and has specific articles detailing the tasks and workings of the High Representative for Foreign Relations. But it does not go as far as the US:

>(Art. 6) No State, without the Consent of the united States, in congress assembled, shall send any embassy to, or receive any embassy from, or enter into any conferrence, agreement, alliance, or treaty, with any King prince or state; nor shall any person holding any office of profit or trust under the united states, or any of them, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state; nor shall the united states, in congress assembled, or any of them, grant any title of nobility.

Ok, this gives the US confederate structure monopoly on foreign representation and action.

The EU is nowhere near that, its member states can and are routinely engaged in foreign relations independent of the Union and create substructures internally that act independently.

Is this then one of the reasons you cannot call the EU a confederation? Because it lacks monopoly on foreign relations?

But then again, so did some other confederations? The Holy Roman Empire for example routinely had members engaged in foreign relations externally and internally and yet it's widely characterized as a confederation.

And when it comes to diplomacy and foreign relations of a 'confederation', wouldn't today's EU already surpass the breakaway Confederacy of the US in terms of international recognition as a serious 'confederated entity'? The Confederacy was largely unrecognized with many informal international ties but never anything on an official level. The EU already has diplomatic missions abroad and other countries send delegations to the EU which are ranked on the same level as diplomats.

The EU also lacks powers in the war area. Is the explicit power of violence a precondition for confederation?

The early US could declare war, the EU cannot.

So is this the actual reason for the non-confederation status? But then don't other historic confederations also had the problem that they couldn't declare war as a confederation entity?

Looking closer to 'lack of substantive power' reveals something else: The US under the AoC actually lacked power in areas which the EU already has today, most notably in the economic area. Interstate commerce and monetary policy in the early US was really messy and nowhere near as regulated and powerful as in the EU institutions today.

The European Central Bank powers already surpasses the powers of whatever monetary institution(s) the US confederation had. Monopoly on printing a single currency, to set lending rates, mandates on price stability etc.

The internal market and customs union rules of the EU are already much more cohesive to external markets than whatever the confederation had (or rather not had).

The Court of Justice of the EU, while not an appellate court or supreme court in that sense, is already the sole interpreter of Union law and has ruled EU law primacy. This principle was in the air during the confederation period of the US where the supremacy of federal vs. state law was still so much more vague than what the ECJ has now.

I kinda find it hard to see where to draw the line. If the US and several other historical entities are confederations while clearly lacking powers in substantive areas which the EU already has, why is the EU not already classified as a confederation?

freedom,politicaldiscussion,British economy and the war in Ukraine,"Provoked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the global energy crisis could shut down the United Kingdom. British factories, shops, and pubs could close due to the spiraling cost of uncapped gas and electricity.

After the imposition of sanctions against Moscow, gas prices have spiked in the UK. According to analysts, domestic energy bills could more than triple and hit [£ 6,500 a year by April](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11137623/Spiralling-energy-bills-nearly-THREE-QUARTERS-UK-pubs-extinct-Christmas.html).

[Inflation](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis-recession-looms) in the country has already exceeded 10% for the first time in 40 years.

On top of that, the British are at risk of facing an acute shortage of food and goods as strikes by workers at the UK's largest port, Felixstowe, have disrupted the supply chain in the country.

Earlier, the mayor of London [said](https://twitter.com/MayorofLondon/status/1560889289403146241) that millions of Britons will not be able to afford heating and food in the upcoming winter unless the authorities take action. As a result, British libraries and museums are being converted into ""*warm shelters""* for people who are at risk of freezing in their homes.

Meanwhile, the British government is sending billions of dollars in military support to Ukraine. London has been bankrolling Kyiv since the beginning of the conflict spending $2.8 billion of the British taxpayers' money. This is more than any other country except the United States. The UK's military support to Ukraine includes 5000 NLAW anti-tank missiles, launch rockets, artillery systems, etc.

Earlier, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson [claimed](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11143643/Boris-Johnson-energy-bills-rising-Ukraine-paying-blood.html) that ""*it’s sensible for British taxpayers to support freedom in Ukraine""* and that it’s ""*absolutely right.""*

First of all, are the British actually freezing and starving due to this crisis or has it been blown out of proportion by the media?

Second, instead of sending more weapons to Kyiv, should the UK spend all this money at home to help its own people, or is it more important to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's aggression?

freedom,politicaldiscussion,"Where Does American Democracy Go From Here? (and how bad are things, really?)","I was reading an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/17/magazine/democracy.html) which contained transcript from a panel of experts discussing the state of American democracy and was struck by their discussion and perspectives. The title of the article is the same title I wrote for this post, except for the extra question I added in brackets, yet I didn't quite feel like I could come to a conclusion on where American democracy goes from here. The overall sense I get is that it's not going anywhere but down. 

Would love to start a dialogue about the panelists' perspectives and other perspectives on where American democracy is heading, how to safeguard democracy (and the feasibility of this), and what different pathways there are in doing this, whether it be through the media, judicial, congressional, or political party transformations, demographic and cultural changes, freak historical events (those once in a lifetime moments like Covid or 9/11), and so on. **Looking forward to your insights!**

South Korean President Moon Jae-in also expressed his “deepest sympathies” to Biden and the American people, that his country would continue to support U.S. efforts to combat terrorism.

>But less than 50 miles from the Soviet Union sat Pakistan, a close  ally of the United States, a member since 1955 of the South-East Asia  Treaty Organization (SEATO), the US-created anti-communist alliance.  On  the very border of the Soviet Union was Iran, an even closer ally of  the United States, with its relentless electronic listening posts,  aerial surveillance, and infiltration into Russian territory by American  agents. And alongside Iran, also bordering the Soviet Union, was  Turkey, a member of the Russians’ mortal enemy, NATO, since 1951.  
>  
>In 1962 during the “Cuban Missile Crisis”, Washington, seemingly in a  state of near-panic, informed the world that the Russians were  installing “offensive” missiles in Cuba.  The US promptly instituted a  “quarantine” of the island – a powerful show of naval and marine forces  in the Caribbean would stop and search all vessels heading towards Cuba;  any found to contain military cargo would be forced to turn back.  
>  
>The United States, however, had missiles and bomber bases already in  place in Turkey and other missiles in Western Europe pointed toward the  Soviet Union.  Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev later wrote:  
>  
>The Americans had surrounded our country with military bases and  threatened us with nuclear weapons, and now they would learn just what  it feels like to have enemy missiles pointing at you; we’d be doing  nothing more than giving them a little of their own medicine. … After  all, the United States had no moral or legal quarrel with us. We hadn’t  given the Cubans anything more than the Americans were giving to their  allies. We had the same rights and opportunities as the Americans. Our  conduct in the international arena was governed by the same rules and  limits as the Americans.     
>  
>Lest anyone misunderstand, as Khrushchev apparently did, the rules under which Washington was operating, *Time*  magazine was quick to explain.  ”On the part of the Communists,” the  magazine declared, “this equating \[referring to Khrushchev’s offer to  mutually remove missiles and bombers from Cuba and Turkey\] had obvious  tactical motives.  On the part of neutralists and pacifists \[who  welcomed Khrushchev’s offer\] it betrayed intellectual and moral  confusion.”  The confusion lay, it seems, in not seeing clearly who were  the good guys and who were the bad guys, for “The purpose of the U.S.  bases \[in Turkey\] was not to blackmail Russia but to strengthen the  defense system of NATO, which had been created as a safeguard against  Russian aggression. As a member of NATO, Turkey welcomed the bases as a  contribution to her own defense.”  Cuba, which had been invaded only the  year before, could have, it seems, no such concern.  Time continued its  sermon: Beyond these differences between the two cases, there is an  enormous moral difference between U.S. and Russian objectives … To  equate U.S. and Russian bases is in effect to equate U.S. and Russian  purposes … The U.S. bases, such as those in Turkey, have helped keep the  peace since World War II, while the Russian bases in Cuba threatened to  upset the peace. The Russian bases were intended to further conquest  and domination, while U.S. bases were erected to preserve freedom. The  difference should have been obvious to all.

But then there were the bad hijackings – planes forced to fly from the  United States to Cuba.  When there began to be more of these than  flights in the opposite direction, Washington was obliged to reconsider  its policy.

>  
>Bombing and strafing attacks of Cuba by planes based in the United States began in October 1959, if not before.      In early 1960, there were several fire-bomb air raids on Cuban cane  fields and sugar mills, in which American pilots also took part – at  least three of whom died in crashes, while two others were captured.   The State Department acknowledged that one plane which crashed, killing  two Americans, had taken off from Florida, but insisted that it was  against the wishes of the US government.     
>  
>In March a French freighter unloading munitions from Belgium exploded  in Havana taking 75 lives and injuring 200, some of whom subsequently  died.  The United States denied Cuba’s accusation of sabotage but  admitted that it had sought to prevent the shipment.

>And so it went … reaching a high point in April of the following year  in the infamous CIA-organized invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. Over  100 exiles died in the attack.  Close to 1,200 others were taken  prisoner by the Cubans.  It was later revealed that four American pilots  flying for the CIA had lost their lives as well.     
>  
>Despite the fact that the Kennedy administration was acutely  embarrassed by the unmitigated defeat – indeed, because of it – a  campaign of smaller-scale attacks upon Cuba was initiated almost  immediately, under the rubric of Operation Mongoose.   Throughout the  1960s, the Caribbean island was subjected to  countless sea and air  commando raids by exiles, at times  accompanied by their CIA  supervisors, inflicting damage upon oil refineries, chemical plants and  railroad bridges, cane fields, sugar mills and sugar warehouses;  infiltrating spies, saboteurs and assassins … anything to damage the  Cuban economy, promote disaffection, or make the revolution look bad …  taking the lives of Cuban militia members and others in the process …   pirate attacks on Cuban fishing boats and merchant ships, bombardments  of Soviet vessels docked in Cuba, an assault upon a Soviet army camp  with 12 Russian soldiers reported wounded … a hotel and a theatre  shelled from offshore because Russians and East Europeans were supposed  to be present there …     
>  
>These actions were not always carried out on the direct order of the  CIA or with its foreknowledge, but the Agency could hardly plead “rogue  elephant”.  It had created Operation Mongoose headquarters in Miami that  was truly a state within a city – over, above, and outside the laws of  the United States, not to mention international law, with a staff of  several hundred Americans directing many more Cuban agents in just such  types of actions, with a budget in excess of $50 million a year, and an  arrangement with the local press to keep operations in Florida secret  except when the CIA wanted something publicized.     
>  
>Title 18 of the US Code declares it to be a crime to launch a  “military or naval expedition or enterprise” from the United States  against a country with which the United States is not (officially) at  war. Although US authorities now and then aborted an exile plot or  impounded a boat – sometimes because the Coast Guard or other officials  had not been properly clued in – no Cubans were prosecuted under this  act.  This was no more than to be expected inasmuch as Attorney General  Robert Kennedy had determined after the Bay of Pigs that the invasion  did not constitute a military expedition.     
>  
>The commando raids were combined with a total US trade and credit  embargo, which continues to this day, and which genuinely hurt the Cuban  economy and chipped away at the society’s standard of living. So  unyielding has the embargo been that when Cuba was hard hit by a  hurricane in October 1963, and Casa Cuba, a New York social club, raised  a large quantity of clothing for relief, the United States refused to  grant it an export license on the grounds that such shipment was  “contrary to the national interest”.     
>  
>Moreover, pressure was brought to bear upon other countries to  conform to the embargo, and goods destined for Cuba were sabotaged:  machinery damaged, chemicals added to lubricating fluids to cause rapid  wear on diesel engines, a manufacturer in West Germany paid to produce  ball-bearings off-center, another to do the same with balanced wheel  gears – “You’re talking about big money,” said a CIA officer involved in  the sabotage efforts, “when you ask a manufacturer to go along with you  on that kind of project because he has to reset his whole mold.  And he  is probably going to worry about the effect on future business.  You  might have to pay him several hundred thousand dollars or more.”     
>  
>One manufacturer who defied the embargo was the British Leyland  Company, which sold a large number of buses to Cuba in 1964. Repeated  expressions of criticism and protest by Washington officials and  Congressmen failed to stem deliveries of some of the buses.  Then, in  October, an East German cargo ship carrying another 42 buses to Cuba  collided in thick fog with a Japanese vessel in the Thames. The Japanese  ship was able to continue on, but the cargo ship was beached on its  side; the buses would have to be “written off”, said the Leyland  company.  In the leading British newspapers it was just an accident  story.     In the *New York Times*  it was not even reported. A decade was to pass before the American  columnist Jack Anderson disclosed that his CIA and National Security  Agency sources had confirmed that the collision had been arranged by the  CIA with the cooperation of British intelligence.      Subsequently, another CIA officer stated that he was skeptical about  the collision story, although admitting that “it is true that we were  sabotaging the Leyland buses going to Cuba from England, and that was  pretty sensitive business.”

>In 1971, also according to participants, the CIA turned over to Cuban  exiles a virus which causes African swine fever.  Six weeks later, an  outbreak of the disease in Cuba forced the slaughter of 500,000 pigs to  prevent a nationwide animal epidemic.  The outbreak, the first ever in  the Western hemisphere, was called the “most alarming event” of the year  by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.

>Ten years later, the target may well have been human beings, as an  epidemic of dengue fever swept the Cuban island.  Transmitted by  blood-eating insects, usually mosquitos, the disease produces severe flu  symptoms and incapacitating bone pain.  Between May and October 1981,  over 300,000 cases were reported in Cuba with 158 fatalities, 101 of  which were children under 15.      In 1956 and 1958, declassified documents have revealed, the US Army  loosed swarms of specially bred mosquitos in Georgia and Florida to see  whether disease-carrying insects could be weapons in a biological war.   The mosquitos bred for the tests were of the Aedes Aegypti type, the  precise carrier of dengue fever as well as other diseases.     In 1967 it was reported by *Science*  magazine that at the US government center in Fort Detrick, Maryland,  dengue fever was amongst those “diseases that are at least the objects  of considerable research and that appear to be among those regarded as  potential BW \[biological warfare\] agents.”  
>  
>The ingenuity which went into the chemical and biological warfare  against Cuba was apparent in some of the dozens of plans to assassinate  or humiliate Fidel Castro. Devised by the CIA or Cuban exiles, with the  cooperation of American mafiosi, the plans ranged from poisoning  Castro’s cigars and food to a chemical designed to make his hair and  beard fall off and LSD to be administered just before a public speech.  There were also of course the more traditional approaches of gun and  bomb, one being an attempt to drop bombs on a baseball stadium while  Castro was speaking; the B-26 bomber was driven away by anti-aircraft  fire before it could reach the stadium.     It is a combination of such Cuban security measures, informers,  incompetence, and luck which has served to keep the bearded one alive to  the present day.  
>  
>Attempts were also made on the lives of Castro’s brother Raul and Che  Guevara.  The latter was the target of a bazooka fired at the United  Nations building in New York in December 1964.      Various Cuban exile groups have engaged in violence on a regular  basis in the United States with relative impunity for decades.  One of  them, going by the name of Omega 7 and headquartered in Union City, New  Jersey, was characterized by the FBI in 1980 as “the most dangerous  terrorist organization in the United States”. Attacks against Cuba itself began to lessen around the end of the  1960s, due probably to a lack of satisfying results combined with ageing  warriors, and exile groups turned to targets in the United States and  elsewhere in the world.  
>  
>During the next decade, while the CIA continued to pour money into  the exile community, more than 100 serious “incidents” took place in the  United States for which Omega 7 and other groups claimed  responsibility.  (Within the community, the distinction between a  terrorist and a non-terrorist group is not especially precise; there is  much overlapping identity and frequent creation of new names.) There  occurred repeated bombings of the Soviet UN Mission, its Washington  embassy, its automobiles, a Soviet ship docked in New Jersey, the  offices of the Soviet airline Aeroflot, with a number of American  policemen and Russians injured in these attacks; several bombings of the   Cuban UN Mission and its Interests Section in Washington, many attacks  upon Cuban diplomats, including at least one murder; a bomb discovered  at New York’s Academy of Music in 1976 shortly  before a celebration of  the Cuban Revolution was to begin; a  bombing two years later of the  Lincoln Center after the Cuban ballet had performed; three bombings in a  single night in 1979:  the office of a New Jersey Cuban refugee  program, a New Jersey pharmacy that sent medical supplies to Cuba, and a  suitcase that exploded at JFK Airport, injuring four luggage handlers,  minutes before it was to be placed aboard a TWA flight to Los Angeles.     
>  
>The single most violent act of this period was the blowing up of a  Cubana Airlines plane shortly after it took off from Barbados on 6  October 1976, which took the lives of 73 people including the entire  Cuban championship fencing team.  CIA documents later revealed that on  22 June, a CIA officer abroad had cabled a report to Agency headquarters  that he had learned from a source that a Cuban exile group planned to  bomb a Cubana airliner flying between Panama and Havana.  The group’s  leader was a baby doctor named Orlando Bosch.  After the plane crashed  in the sea in October, it was Bosch’s network of exiles that claimed  responsibility.  The cable showed that the CIA had the means to  penetrate the Bosch organization, but there’s no indication in any of  the documents that the Agency undertook any special monitoring of Bosch  and his group because of their plans, or that the CIA warned Havana.     
>  
>In 1983, while Orlando Bosch sat in a Venezuelan prison charged with  masterminding the plane bombing, the City Commission of Miami proclaimed  a “Dr. Orlando Bosch Day"". In 1968, Bosch had been convicted of a bazooka attack on a Polish ship in Miami.  
>  
>Although there has always been the extreme lunatic fringe in the  Cuban exile community (as opposed to the normal lunatic fringe)  insisting that Washington has sold out their cause, over the years there  has been only the occasional arrest and conviction of an exile for a  terrorist attack in the United States, so occasional that the exiles can  only assume that Washington’s heart is not wholly in it.  The exile  groups and their key members are well known to the authorities, for the  anti-Castroites have not excessively shied away from publicity.  At  least as late as the early 1980s, they were training openly in southern  Florida and southern California; pictures of them flaunting their  weapons appeared in the press.     The CIA, with its countless contacts-cum-informers amongst the exiles,  could fill in many of the missing pieces for the FBI and the police, if  it wished to.  In 1980, in a detailed report on Cuban-exile terrorism, *The Village Voice* of New York reported:  
>  
>Two stories were squeezed out of New York police officials … “You  know, it’s funny,” said one cautiously, “there have been one or two  things … but let’s put it this way. You get just so far on a case and  suddenly the dust is blown away. Case closed. You ask the CIA to help,  and they say they aren’t really interested. You get the message.”  Another investigator said he was working on a narcotics case involving  Cuban exiles a couple of years ago, and telephone records he obtained  showed a frequently dialed number in Miami. He said he traced the number  to a company called Zodiac, “which turned out to be a CIA front.” He  dropped his investigation.     
>  
>The Cuban exiles in the United States, collectively, may well constitute the longest lasting and most prolific terrorist group in the  world.  It is thus the height of irony, not to mention hypocrisy, that  for many years up to the present time in the 1990s, the State Department  has included Cuba amongst those nations that “sponsor terrorism”, not  because of any terrorist acts committed by the Cuban government, but  solely because they “harbor terrorists”.

tl;dr the USA acted like hypocrites during the Cuban Missile Crisis, has sponsored multiple terrorist groups against Cuba, attempted an illegal invasion in 1961, blocked charity to Cuba, sunk a British ship violating the Cuban embargo and carried out a campaign of chemical and biological warfare against Cuba...

Today, abortion remains a contested issue, along with same-sex marriage, climate change, school choice, even the freedoms of religious institutions to congregate during a public health crisis. Republicans have a solid majority on SCOTUS, which has called many of these issues into question.

freedom,politicaldiscussion,Are Singapore's limits on freedom of speech a good model for the rest of the world?,"Two days ago, a French middle-school teacher named Samuel Paty was killed and beheaded by a Muslim refugee for showing his students a Charlie Hebdo cartoon of Muhammad in a moral and civic education class on freedom of expression. More than five years ago, twelve employees of Charlie Hebdo were killed for publishing that cartoon.

While Singapore's government condemned the 2015 attacks, the Charlie Hebdo cartoon of Muhammad would never be legally printed or published in Singapore. This is due to the fact that Singapore has numerous laws that **prohibit speech that causes disharmony among religious groups. It is a criminal offence to for anyone to deliberately wound the religious or racial feelings of any person**.

Interestingly, Singapore also legally prohibits online harassment and cyberbullying against anyone regardless of ages.

All these restrictions on freedom of speech are part of an effort to ensure harmony between its multiethnic population and prevent the violent ethnic conflicts that accompanied Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia and independence from ever happening again. From decades of evidence, the efforts seem to have worked and Singapore has not been suffering from racial violence or religious terrorism that has plagued other multi-ethnic societies in recent years.

In an infamous 2015 incident that received international coverage and commentary, the blogger Amos Yee was arrested and jailed for ""intention of wounding the feelings of Christians"". His imprisonment was widely condemned by human right organizations worldwide such as Amnesty International. Shortly after his release, he fled and gained asylum in the United States but has been getting in trouble with the law for different reasons.

**To replicate Singapore's success in preserving social harmony, should France, the United States, and the rest of the world implement similar laws against ""hate speech""? Or are Singapore's laws and government authoritarian and backwards, like many in the West have said?**

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,"In the United States, if a Native American reservation wants to pass/amend legislation, it must be approved by the Federal government. Should this be changed?","In 1934, the United States federal government passed the [Indian Reorganization Act (IRA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Reorganization_Act?wprov=sfla1).  The centerpiece of the so-called ""Indian New Deal,"" the act is most well-known for establishing the modern bureaucratic apparatus used to govern Native American reservations.  While certain sections of the law have been challenged over the years by various groups, no aspect is more universally despised amongst Native Americans than the doctrine of Secretarial Review.

Under the IRA, whenever a tribal government seeks to pass a law of any kind, impose any tax, hold any referendum, or modify their constitution, the action must be presented to the United States Secretary of the Interior (currently [David Bernhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bernhardt?wprov=sfla1)) for approval. In accordance with the Act, the Secretary is free to approve or deny the request for any reason whatsoever. While reservations are technically allowed to challenge the decision of the Interior Secretary in federal courts, history shows a significant slant in favor of the Federal government. The courts routinely cite the 1889 US Supreme Court case *United States v Kagama* as precedent, with the case stating: ""The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful ... is necessary to their protection as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell.""  

Arguments in favor of Secretarial Review often revolve around a few key points:

1. Native American Tribes used to be at war with the United States, and thus need their laws reviewed to make sure they don't conflict with the Constitution.

2. Secretarial approval is more of a rubber stamp, as modern secretaries wouldn't want the bad press of denying the will of the people.

3. All tribes were given the opportunity to opt-out of the law, and as such the people freely chose to adopt this system.

Opponents of Secretarial Approval have made several arguments, including: 

1. Without Secretarial Approval, tribal governments are still required to follow the constitution, with federal courts still able to overturn Tribal laws which violate the US constitution.

2. The possibility of having the Secretary of the Interior deny the implementation of a law effectively serves as a deterrent to passing certain laws, even if said laws enjoy majority support amongst the residents of the reservations.

3. Most native Americans consider the elections which took place for tribes to opt out of the law as scam elections. In the vast majority of native American cultures, an abstention is counted as a 'no' vote. However, these referendums counted any tribal resident who did not show up to vote, yet was eligible to vote, as voting yes.  Despite then-Representative William Hastings (a member of the Cherokee nation) pointing this out as a potential cause for mass confusion amongst the Indian population to his colleagues in Congress, his warnings were ignored. Lack of notification, ballots being printed solely in English, and inconsistent requirements on who was allowed to vote, also served to cause mass confusion. Hastings appeared to have been vindicated in his belief, as a Chocktaw Leader said the day after the referendum ""90% of us did not show up, yet apparently 95% of us somehow voted for white tyranny.""  

Following the referendum, the whole ordeal was widely mocked by Native Americans, with the Indian Rights Association actually openly calling then Secretary of the Bureau of Indian Affairs John Collier a Dictator. 

With all this context, I pass off the question to this thread: Should Secretarial Review be abolished?  Should it simply be revised for the modern day, or is the system fine as it is?",365,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/dc59pi/in_the_united_states_if_a_native_american/,1569989980.0,dc59pi
tyranny,politicaldiscussion,Would the United States benefit from a formalized Cursus Honorum for holding political office?,"I’m going to give the details of the Roman institution short shrift; if you are interested in history and want fine detail, there are many good sources. Suffice it to say, that during the Roman Republican period, the Cursus Honorum, or “course of honor,” was a series of progressively more powerful offices that had minimum age requirements and which required a candidate to hold the lower offices before being eligible for higher ones. This was the way that the Roman Constitution regulated the political ambition of young politicians and progressively trained them to the functions and duties of governance. Arguably, this legal and traditional restriction on access to the higher offices ensured stable governance, protected against populist tyranny, and created a resevoir of administrative, military, and legal talent the State could draw upon to meet the challenges of guiding the State wisely.

In the Republican era, you did not have incompetents, scoundrels, and the power-mad wielding supreme power by the inheritance or usurpation of imperium like what happened when the Republic was in its death throes, and during the Imperial Period that followed it. 

The earliest age a Roman could seek one of the two Consul seats (the head of State) was 40 or 42 depending on his ancestry.

That candidate for Consul would have to have previously held offices that required him to fulfill a wide range of state duties: financial duties related to taxes, military operations, and the state treasury; political duties as a member of the Senate; administrative duties related to public infrastructure, buildings, and events; legal duties in the Roman courts; military command duties over Roman legions, and in direct governance of a Roman province; and ceremonial and religious duties throughout his career. A candidate for the Consulship understood, or at least had some experience in, the full range of functions of the Roman State. There were some uninspired Consuls in during the Republic, but there were very few embarrassingly incompetent or stupid ones, which might help account for why a small village rose to rule most of the known world.

The US Constitution, like the *mos maiorum* or ""way of our ancestors"" which was the equivalent of the unwritten Roman Constitution, stipulates age requirements for holding public office: 25 for election to the House of Representatives, 30 for election to the Senate, 35 for election to the Presidency.  It doesn't, however, stipulate any requirement that for election to successively higher offices that the person seeking election must have been elected to lower office first.  So, for example, would it be beneficial to make changes to the Constitution to require that all newly elected US Senators first have held office as a US Representative?  Or that to be eligible to seek the office of President of the United States a candidate must first have been elected a US Senator or Governor of a State?",71,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/8502ni/would_the_united_states_benefit_from_a_formalized/,1521245581.0,8502ni

Veto points, such as the House of Lords and the monarch, seem to be infrequently used to the point of irrelevance.

* Voting is a civic duty,all citizens also have a duty to stop corruption

* Separation of Church and State keeps government free from religious disputes and religions free from government corruption.

* The Constitution is important,but it isn't sacred scripture since the world belongs to the living.

* All people have the right to be informed and be educated.

* The federal government cannot violate the rights of individuals and states.

* Freedom of speech and press are a safeguard against tyranny.

* Economic growth and expansion would lead to the creation of a class of wage laborers who are not independent voters since they are economically dependent on others.(Well he got this part right,didn't he?) The solution is wealth redistribution through taxes.

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,Is it time for Rubio to officially go #nevertrump?,"I feel there is only one remaining option for Sen. Rubio.

If Sen. Rubio is intent on distinguishing himself from the other 3 candidates. He has to finally unequivocally disavow Donald Trump. I believe after the last debate he has legitimate grounds to finally do so. The vulgarity, the brashness, the poor policies are not a reason enough to disavow a candidate but this finally is. The reason to publicly disavow Donald Trump has been his thinly veiled attitude toward centralized power in the hands of one man. He has encouraged violence toward protesters, expressed a desire to restrict the freedom of the press, and in last night's debate, admitted that he would lead the military in tactics that would violate the Geneva Convention. This is not what America is. America is the greatest country in the world solely because the power lies with the people and not the federal government or (even worse) one individual. We can have differing views on policy, but there are certain things we MUST agree on. As Republicans, as Conservatives and as AMERICANS, we must agree that we must always reject centralized power in the hands of one man. Let's Make America Great Again by remembering that. 

I know this is a risky stance for Marco to take. Comparing Trump to a dictator can be totally potentially ruinous to his political future. If Trump is the nominee, there is no way Marco can show his face in public or even call himself a republican, leaving him as a man without a party. If Trump ever becomes president, there is no way Rubio can run or hold elective office as a Republican. However, a Donald Trump candidacy is likely to result in a irreparable party fracture and devastating defeat in November anyway why not have Marco lead that split? 

Despite the damaging potential of such a bold declaration, Rubio's disavowal has the potential to be life-saving to his campaign, the party, and potentially, the country. A strong, bold, and public disavowal on such heavy grounds would OWN the news cycle. Not only would he be the first to break the pledge but it would also re-frame the race as a two man race (like it was before Super Tuesday). Whose side are you on America? Rubio's or Trump's? It might actually force news networks to talk about history, the constitution and the damage Trump could do to it. Kasich and Cruz would be forced to answer the question and follow Trump or Rubio. If they chose to deflect, they'd risk looking indecisive and unprincipled in fear of damaging their political future. Rubio is not without grounds or basis for making such a charge and would easily be able to articulate the gravity and severity of his disavowal. He'd do so with the full backing of many prominent figures. You have seen recently with Sen. Ben Sasse, Mitt Romney, and the #NeverTrump movement that there is a following there and the tyrannical concern gives a disavowal the weight that it deserves. 

Also, it just so happens to be the politically optimal moment for Rubio to make such a charge. His campaign is on life support and Trump is flirting with sowing up the nomination. Shifting the argument from con-man to dictator ramps up the severity of the charges and puts Rubio on the moral high ground. Also, it goes with out saying, that on March 15th all eyes will be on Florida. Rubio, the son of Cuban migrants will undoubtedly be campaigning on his backstory and trying to rake up as much as the Cuban vote as possible. What better way to do that than to simply say to the people of Miami, ""We know all to well what tyrannical power can lead to, for just 100 miles from here a government that restricts the press, oppresses dissent, and punishes political opponents rules with unchecked power. That is why many of you are here today, because you would rather risk your life than live in a country like that"". Trump would not be able to insult his way out of this. This is too heavy a charge. If he didn't address it seriously it could raise serious questions.          

Now even if this strategy works, and Rubio becomes the nominee, there is potential for losing Trump supporters, but maybe not. Many Trump supporters may look at what he's said and be forced to look in the mirror. They can begin to look at history and then look at Trump's rhetoric and possibly see what he's become. This will also earn him the respect of many that he is bold enough and strong enough to stand up to the evil of tyranny. A strong, public disavowal on the basis of a fear of tyrannical power will not be something Trump can insult away. Or at least, it shouldn't be.

One question Rubio will undoubtedly face is ""Why did you say you'd support him in the debate?"" The answer is simple, ""I love the Republican Party. It has been a wonderful movement for my family and this country. The last thing I'd want to do is anything that I think might hurt it's future or it's chances of winning the election in November. However, after hearing Trump's remarks and re-reading them today, I've decided there is absolutely no way I can support a man who would force our military to violate the Geneva Convention. I have struggled with his attitude toward dissent and the press for a while now but that response finally did it for me""

What happens if he does this?

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,Hypothetical: what would the effects be if the Electoral College split along district lines?,"This is just something I've been rolling around in my head a bit.

The United States Electoral College divides up electors based on the number of congressional representatives in both the Senate and House per state. My home state of Virginia has 13 electors: 11 for each Representative, and two for the Senators.

Generally speaking, 48 of the 50 states apportion all their electoral votes to the majority winner in their state - therefore, if 60% of the state votes for Candidate Doofus, and 40% votes for Candidate numbskull, all the electoral votes go to Doofus, with none left for numbskull.

Maine and Nebraska do this differently. They use what is called the ""congressional district method."" The residents of each congressional (read: House) district select their elector by popular vote, and the majority winner of the whole state is who the remaining two (senatorial) electors vote for. Despite this Nebraska went full for Romney and Maine full for Obama last go-round, so there's that.

Is this a preferable system? Should it be mandated, or even suggested, that electoral votes be split up along district lines, and the two others selected by - something else? (Cast by the state legislature? Popular vote in the state? National popular vote? Governor's approval? Cast by the U.S. Senators for that state themselves?)

What would the likely effects of this be? Which party would benefit - the Republicans with their superior state and local political machines, or the Democrats with a renewed focus on urban centers? Would Presidential candidates have to - *gasp* - campaign in more than eight states? Would the California electoral tyranny be broken? Would Donald Trump take Kanye West as his running mate and beat the Joss Whedon/Anita Sarkeesian ticket next year? (That was a joke.)

Please assume for this debate that we are retaining the Electoral College at all. I've heard plenty of debates one way or another, and that's not the question I'm asking.

My personal hope for the future, and I see no good future for humans without this happening, is the gradual move way from centralized authority to decentralized running of society.

[Blockchain protocol technology](http://www.coindesk.com/block-chain-technology-digital-democracy/) is very exciting to me for these reasons.

Large masses of people starting to live independent of centralized government using technology is how the influence of centralized governments will wain and lose their influence.

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,The Second Amendment and the Right of Revolution,"By happy coincidence I’m posting this on Independence Day. It doesn’t appear that gun control will be a big issue in 2016, but whenever it comes up I hear arguments for gun rights based on self-defense and hunting. I think this avoids the main point of the Second Amendment. This is on the longer side, but I had to provide some evidence to my points. Eager to hear what you guys think. Happy 4th.

The Second Amendment was added to the Constitution to ensure the people had the means to overthrow their government. We know this because the wording explicitly states it is for the security of a free state, and because the people who conceived the Amendment and the Constitution said so.
Thomas Jefferson: “No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government""
Check out plenty more here: http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/gun-quotations-founding-fathers

An armed citizenry which can protect itself and fight the state is an important part of a free society. People are entitled to change the society in which they live by armed force. This is known as the Right of Revolution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_revolution).
The argument against this reading of the Second Amendment or the Right to Revolution can be broken down into two camps. The “You Cannot” and the “You Should Not.”

**The “You Cannot” Argument: You cannot rebel against the United States government because it is militarily impractical**
The past century in military history has been marked by the prominence of asymmetrical, usually guerilla warfare. I.E., when a much smaller force with less material support fights a larger, more powerful force. And we have seen how effective this form of warfare can be. The most glaring example is Afghanistan, where the US military has, after more than a decade of war, not been able to stamp out the Taliban insurgency. Reaper drones, tanks, and strategic bombers cannot defeat a ragtag resistance movement which only has access to small arms. And to name just a few other recent conflicts in which guerilla forces have defeated, through military victory and shifting of public opinion, a larger force: Vietnam War, Soviet War in Afghanistan, Algerian War, Cuban Revolution, Portuguese Colonial War. And the Syrian Civil War is still ongoing. There’s a (probably) fake quote by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto of the Imperial Japanese Navy that goes, “You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind each blade of grass.” The USA is a vast country with a huge population. If even a significant portion of that population took up arms, it would be very difficult for the US military combat it. And this isn’t even accounting for if some military units chose not to fight or defected.

**The “You Should Not” Argument: Sub argument A: Because we have the right to vote, there is no need to overthrow the government by arms when we can do so through the ballot box**
The 20th and 21st centuries are replete with examples of democratic systems morphing into authoritarian systems. Politicians can effectively use fear and resentment in order to convince people that their liberty is worth sacrificing for something else, usually security. Look at the developments in the USA since 9/11: warrantless wiretapping, mass surveillance of telecommunications, torture, assassinations of American citizens, and indefinite detention without habeas corpus. Some examples of democratic systems becoming authoritarian include Italy in the 1920s, Peru in the 1990s, 1950s Argentina, (increasingly) present day Russia, many of the ex-Soviet central Asian republics (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan), etc. Democracy is not a magic pill to human faults, including the desire for power and the desire for security.

**The “You Should Not” Argument: Sub argument B: Nonviolence is always better**
Nonviolence doesn’t always work. The two most famous examples of nonviolent resistance are British India and the Civil Rights Movement, but both of these cases dealt with nations whose populations were largely sympathetic to the strugglers’ plight, and the governments which were responsive to their populations. If we look at a case like Tibet, where the Chinese state doesn’t give a damn about their population, and has no qualms about using violence, we see that nonviolence is ineffective. And governments have gotten more effective in dealing with nonviolent resistance. Look at the recent protests in Hong Kong, when the Chinese state realized that if it did nothing, the resistance would peter out. And it did.

**The “You Should Not” Argument: Sub argument C: Violence against your government is treason.**
Modern Western civilization is based on the idea of the social contract, wherein the people give authority and power to the state to do some things, as long as that state doesn’t trample on their freedom. If the state tramples their rights, the people have the right to change that state. The idea is innate, but was best articulated during the Enlightenment by men like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. And it’s cited in the Declaration of Independence as the reason for the Revolution. If you don’t think people should be able to fight their government, you are Counter-Enlightenment, and you believe people are subservient to the state.

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,"Let's discuss: Philosophical ""liberalism"" is not the opposite of ""conservatism"" and is not any particular policy prescription, it is rather a framework for understanding the world that values individualism, egalitarianism, progressivism, universalism, and the ideas that uphold those principles.","This is in response to a popular thread today asking about how people defined liberalism. 

A lot of people understood liberalism as essentially ""the opposite of conservatism"", and most people who didn't have that understanding defined the different schools of liberalism (classical, social, neo, etc.) by their particular policy prescriptions like whether they are for free markets versus government-owned industries, what they say for civil liberties versus the imperative of maintaining order, etc.

While both of those definitions are appropriate for the colloquial US use of ""liberalism"", or for how the term is used in US politics and economics parlance, I do not think that either of those answers offer a sophisticated, academic, holistic understand of the Philosophy of Liberalism. 

Liberalism, I argue, is not about a specific policy prescription for any specific situation, it's about a framework for understanding the world. A framework for understanding that world that seeks to free individuals from unjust and damaging oppression, whether that was to protect lords from their kings, or later the middle classes from their lords, or later the lower classes from the powerful, or from communitarianism or the tyranny of the majority, or even from social taboo, its about developing an understanding of the world that allows you to identify and repair these limitations to individual freedom. It's a philosophy that traces inspirations back to some of the great texts from the beginnings of western civilization in Greece and Rome, that slowly percolated over the hundreds of years of feudal european life and conflict, that burst into the intellectual consciousness during the Enlightenment, that was ferociously developed and argued over the 1800's, that is possibly the single underlying cause of of both World Wars, and that emerged from those wars as the undisputed philosophical underpinnings of nearly every significant state in the world.

Please do me a favor and don't judge my academic definition of liberalism by the standard of the colloquial definition. You're right, that is what people generally mean when they say it (in America), there's no disputing it, when I'm talking to people and they ask me what my opinion is on ""liberal this"" or ""that"" I understand what they're saying and respond appropriately. You'll probably think to yourself, ""tuna, your definition of liberalism is so uselessly broad that I would consider myself a liberal even though I'm a staunch conservative"". It's not that it's useless, its that we're defining different things, and just keep in mind what I am defining. I'm just trying to defend the honor of ""liberalism"" here on /r/politicaldiscussion because it truly is the guiding philosophy of the free world and in my opinion one of humanity's crowning achievements.

Liberalism is a framework for understanding the world that is intended to lead towards the best possible outcomes for individual liberty. The framework is devised of principles that have been logically identified as being necessary to producing a society where people are free. These principles include:

* individualism
* egalitarianism
* progressivism (as in, the belief that society can and must be continuously improved)
* universalism
* universal liberal education
* universal suffrage
* science and knowledge
* free speech
* free expression
* the marketplace of ideas
* democracy
* questioning authority
* questioning tradition
* resistance to groupthink
* logic
* critical thinking
* civil liberties

And more things, but they are relate to the goal of individual freedom. For example, to protect people from the concentration of political power, you need democracy, and for democracy to function, you need free press and speech and other civil liberties so that people can have access to accurate information and a variety of ideas and so they are not afraid to vote their conscience. They also need a liberal education and the impulse to question the status quo if they are to have the intellectual tools with which to make the best choices.

So that is liberalism. America is a liberal democratic country. Most Republicans are liberals. As the opposite of ""conservative"", they should probably call the Democrats ""progressive"".",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2pfeos/lets_discuss_philosophical_liberalism_is_not_the/,1418697930.0,2pfeos
tyranny,politicaldiscussion,Hate Speech and Freedom of Speech,"I'm a libertarian, and I was watching the Stossel show recently as I do every Thursday on FBN, this episode really struck a chord, it was about free speech and how even hate speech should be part of free speech. I completely agreed, I mean does hate speech offen people? Yes, but they are not forced to listen to it and if somebody attacks you personally that's harrasment and that should be illegal. Hate speech is speech that is offensive to a group, and if idiots feel that being gay or black makes you less worthy of enjoying life...then let them. It's their opinion and they have a right to express it! In Germany and Canada hate speech is banned , in the US, anyone can speak their mind! The right to express yourself regardless of the popularity of your beliefs is something we take for granted in the US. If hate speech can be censored, so can opposition to hate speech. 20 years ago gay men were being arrested for having sex IN THEIR OWN HOMES!! And today most states allow gay marriage! This prpgress comes from open discussion. Another thing is that hate speech can violate religious freedom, many parts of the quran and bible would be considered hate speech against the LGBT communities but they should still be allowed to express their beliefs. Similarly, blasphemy can be considered hate speech and in some countries is ground for execution. Free speech is vital to a progressive society, not only does it give us the power to express ourselves, but it gives us the power to engage in open discussion, analyze unpopular topics, help people learn from their ignorance and most importantly protects us from government tyrannyIn Germany hate speech is banned , in the US, anyone can speak their mind! The right to express yourself regardless of the popularity of your beliefs is something we take for granted in the US. If hate speech can be censored, so can opposition to hate speech.

So do you guys think free speech is vital and should it include hate speech? Also, any instances of censorship you would like to share?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/26922t/hate_speech_and_freedom_of_speech/,1400799454.0,26922t
tyranny,politicaldiscussion,There Was Never an Intent For an Individual Right to Firearms,"The Second Amendment is one of the most controversial amendments in the Constitution, if not the most controversial. It wasn’t always so, it has only been in the last several years that the meaning of the amendment was changed by the courts to grant citizens a broad right to firearms. However, this is not what the founders had in mind. So, what were they thinking?

The Second Amendment was thought for:

* Repelling invasion;
* Suppressing insurrection;
* Participating in law enforcement;
* Enabling the people to organize a militia system

Having a standing army, a professional military force, was seen by the Congress of the newly born America to be a tool of tyranny, and therefore a thing to be avoided. It was also feared that more powerful states could wage war against other states to expand power and to gain resources.  

For example, the original constitution, today called The Articles of Confederation, states:

>“No vessels of war shall be kept up in time of peace, by any state, except such number only, as shall be deemed necessary by the united states, in congress assembled, for the defence of such state, or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up, by any state, in time of peace, except such number only as, in the judgment of the united states, in congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defence of such state; but every state shall always keep up a well regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accounted, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition, and camp equipage.”

Why did it include the qualifier that Congress be the judge of necessary forces? Because they didn't want, for instance, New York annexing New Jersey. This, by the way, was also the blueprint for the Second Amendment.

Therefore the several states would be permitted only to raise a militia of non-professional citizen soldiers. This is kind of how the revolution was won. But the system didn’t last long.

It was nearly a failure during the Whiskey Rebellion when three states couldn’t muster a militia and a draft had to be instituted.

The militia system completely fell apart after the war of 1812 where the White House was burned and American forces were defeated in several major battles on their own soil.

In the Constitution, there was never a plan to have a standing army.

Article I, Section 8 still reads:

>“To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.”

There is no militia today. And the states do not appoint officers. The old form of military system is dead. This is what the Second Amendment was meant to ensure, however. Which is why the amendment originally read:

>“The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.""

And the second version:

>“A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms.”

The United States Congress was enforcing the idea that state militias of private citizens were the best form of military because they knew that it's nearly impossible for the citizens to rise up against an organized, professional military. A military like the one the British had, a military like the one we have today. A military that the citizens could not possibly overthrow.

This is also why, up until recently, all case law has allowed the states to regulate arms. It is clear what the founders intended. They did not intend to take regulation away from the states, in fact the opposite is true, just as they did not intend to have a professional national military.

After the revolution we were a confederacy of 14 separate individual states (yes, 14, I am counting Vermont). That didn't work, so we got a new constitution, our current one, and we became more like one state, and now we are as one state, not fifty.

If the states decide to license all gun owners, or have ownership requirements, such as training, then that is the right of the state. It could be argued that such is also the right of Congress.

It's clear that the Second Amendment, much like the Third Amendment, and like the wording of Article I, Section 8, is arcane. The Constitution was not handed down by a divine power, nor was it inspired by one. In particular, the Second Amendment was to ensure that the federal government could wage war, but the military power would be preserved to the individual states. Thinking along those lines has long since been abandoned.

What is particularly interesting about the Second Amendment debate is that it puts conservatives on the wrong side of the big government argument. They don't like big government telling the states what to do, except when big government wants to tell the states that they can't regulate firearms, or allow people to get gay married. It's an absurd contradiction, to say the very least. In fact, the very amendment that conservative justices on the Supreme Court used to push guns, the 14th, is one that many prominent conservatives would like to see repealed.

Anyone for states’ rights should be in support of the state having the ability to regulate the arms of its own residents and the sale of firearms and ammunition within its own borders. Anyone against activist judges should decry the recent Supreme Court interpretations of the Second Amendment, as it is far from what its authors intended. It was designed for national security.

We in the United States no longer have amateur militias. We have professional police and the most advanced, and most expensive by far, military in the history of the known universe.

I can't say with certainty whether Madison would approve of America's 21st century war machine, but I can say for sure that if he were here today he would reject the Supreme Court's interpretation, and be puzzled as to why the United States isn't fighting the epidemic of gun violence that we alone suffer from in the ranks of modern and free nations.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1sx8jt/there_was_never_an_intent_for_an_individual_right/,1387094233.0,1sx8jt

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,My opinion of the state of America.,"I know this is going to seem uppity... But I can't believe everyone is taking this so lightly.  Please forgive me if my facts are a little jumbled, as I wrote this in a single angry session.


It has long been apparent that the American government has, like it's resident financial institutions, too big to fail.  The American machine has begun to think of itself as self-sustaining, and is so secure in it's position as top dog on the global heap that for the first time in recent history a nation has risen so far above the people that comprise it that those selfsame people have forgotten that a government that has lost the mandate of the masses has lost the right to lead.  

America, like Greece and Rome before it, seized the reins of power from it's people by providing strong institutions that could survive the madnesses of men, and in return giving the people a controlling voice in how that government was led.  The much lauded dream has been ""of the people and for the people"", but as a nation of individuals we have betrayed the noble goals of our predecessors with indolence, denial, laziness, and a sense of entitlement that rivals any other such failings in the whole of human history.

We began with a simple set of precepts to found our country.  We had endured nearly a hundred years of second class citizenry because no matter how much we prospered we were still in the eyes of the British merely a colonial extension of their empire.  The British during that period felt that they were close to another expansion of imperialism, and that the American colonies were a crown jewel in that prospect that rivaled India the century before as a source of wealth and prestige.  Our American forefathers threw off the yoke of British imperialism and stood their ground as true men and women of liberty, and because of their ceaseless efforts and will to empire, America survived it's inception, and began it's long march towards freedom and liberty.

The American example emboldened the world.  Stateless minorities throughout all of human civilization realized that they too could displace their governments and monarchies in favor of a democratic society free from caste and oppression.  Support flowed in to the new Americas from various freedom loving nations throughout the world, and a wave of international immigration helped solidify Americas role as a melting pot of all nations and credos.  

With so many people of such diverse backgrounds in one place attempting to live together for the first time, it was inevitable that the human need to circle the wagons and stake off a bit of earth for one's own would surface, and the post colonial days of America contained much of that.  Different segments of our populace made peace with each other by expansion throughout our large nation, and as like flocked to like, we became a loose conglomeration of cliques with very little national control.  The democratic framework we had laid for ourselves gave us enormous control over the law of the land, and the majority always won.  Since most of the decisions were made on a state level, and effected only the state itself, The differences in our states legalities and prejudices escalated to the point where the differences between states could no longer be ignored.  Secession, civil war, defeat, and sweeping changes were to follow, but the MOST important outcome of our countries great division and reunification was that the federal government assumed a level of control that it had never before known.  

The renewed federal government began to systematically revoke or supersede state doctrine, and the military might that we began creating after that period of our history to be ""ready"" in case it ever occurred again was the first step on the road to ruin we find ourselves on today.  Once the government ceased being ""for the people and of the people"", and began transforming itself into a system that ""led the people for the peoples own good,"" it ceased to be our government.  The rules were all the same, and the constitution was honored on it's face, but our government began to separate itself from the people, and to raise itself above the people in order to protect itself from the people.  Never again would American authority be held hostage by the whims of the populace, as most of it's constituency were not aware of the big picture our nation was forced to operate in.  

Anyone who has led any large group of people understands a few things about human nature.  People crave comfort and prosperity, and as long as they have the POTENTIAL to obtain those things, they will spend their lives in denial of any truths which might compromise that security and prosperity.  Our government kept us safe because humans lose their denial when danger looms.  If we are threatened, we band together to eliminate the threat.  The American government has promised us that we need not worry about our personal safety, because they will always be there in the wings to defend the American people from all threats, be they foreign or domestic.  The lack of fear of reprisals freed the American people to pursue life, happiness, and prosperity.  Capitalism was allowed to run rampant, and fortunes were made by a lucky hyper-minority in our country.  The rest of the populace allowed capitalism to run rampant on the promise that they too could become one of the lucky few who hit the jackpot.  As such, we allowed capitalism to grow to such a point that our nation stands on the brink of financial collapse in the face of enormous outstanding debt to foreign interests.  The rest of the world only allowed America to continue as it has for as long as it has because after our nation went nuclear against Japan in defense of foreign interests, the world could not possibly think that we would be unwilling to do so again in defense of ourselves in the face of imminent ruin.  The world stage is terrified of standing up to America as it's excesses threaten to endanger the entire planet, because even animals will pull out all of the stops when cornered, and they know that if Americans are forced to let go of our denial in the face of reality, we will do anything in order to preserve it.  America would not hesitate to hold the world hostage in it's quest for the pursuit of eternal happiness.

In this new age of information, we find ourselves at a crossroads.  We have let the majority of our government exist ""out of sight, out of mind"" for so many years that the various arms of government have had time to solidify themselves into standalone entities.  They have massive budgets year after year that enable them to expand to meet potential new threats, but much of that budget has been used to limit sedition and potential insurrection from it's own people.  As American's we no longer understand enough about how our government actually works to control it, and certainly not to overthrow it when it overextends itself or ceases to act in the best interest of it's people. 

The premises of terrorism, security, safety, and solidarity have been used to lull us into complacency as a people, and the government rarely acts at all anymore unless it is in the best interest of the government itself.  We use resources like the free press and the internet to showcase and expose the governments trespasses, and they respond with legislation limiting the scope of freedom of speech on the internet, and distract the voting public with non-issues such as gay marriage, legalization of drugs, and whatever smoke and mirror campaign they happen to be running at any given point to distract people from the truth.

The most damnably shameful part of all of this is how effective those distractions continue to be.

Even as we're aware that it is happening, we let ourselves get wrapped up in pointless debate and distracted by various minor outrages while the fox is in the henhouse eating it's fill.  We have systematically sacrificed the freedoms and personal liberties our ancestors died to achieve for a gamblers chance at wealth and happiness, and a soulless political machine that grinds us all into soylent compromisers.  This failure is our own.  The government merely accuses the loudest dissenters of treason and locks them in guantanamo bay, and the rest of us learn from that example that the loud are punished, and the meek rewarded.

There comes a time when meek acquiescence to a bully is too shameful to continue to endure.

There are voices of freedom and reason out there though.  Not brilliant men, or wealthy men, but men of liberty.  Snowden is one of those men.

He discovered the smoking gun for us all by revealing the extent of the national security agencies domestic monitoring.  He blew the whistle for us all about a megalithic spy network existing outside of the system of checks and balances that we are all aware of, and he told us in unequivocal terms that our life of American comfort is a lie, and that a fully informed and socially aware public is the greatest enemy of our government (and one that they have been combatting for a generation).  I'm not preaching revolution, and I'm not preaching rebellion or violence.  I AM preaching involvement though.

At this very moment, The US Government is detaining the private jets of foreign ambassadors that they SUSPECT are harboring Snowden while he waits in terror for some nation somewhere to offer him political asylum so he doesn't fall back into the hands of the united states government and simply disappear until he is forgotten.  Over twenty nations have received asylum requests from Snowden, and not a single one of them is willing to risk the ire of an exposed united states to save his life and his voice.  He exists in limbo until he is either apprehended and remanded to the US or given political asylum somewhere in the world.  It is becoming increasingly clear that there is nowhere in the world that an enemy of the united states will be safe.  How long until we all forget about this being news?  How long before the next bombastic senator speaking about pot legalization occupies our political fervor, and what are the odds that there is going to be anything close to a happy ending for this man who's only crime was to speak out against the very definition of domestic terrorism perpetrated by our own government.

It's a sad state of affairs when we can't even save the one man who tried to be a hero to the new sons of liberty from summary execution by the government we set up to protect us from tyranny.

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,The reasons America broke away from Europe in the Declaration of Independence seem awfully familiar to today's affairs...,"IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.  

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,  

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --**That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to *alter* or to *abolish* it**, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. **But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security**.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  

* He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  

* He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  

* He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.   

* **He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.**   

* He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  

* He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  

* He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  

* He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.  

* He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  

* **He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.**  

* He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.  

* He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.  

* He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  

* For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  

* **For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:**  

* For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:  

* For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:   

* For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:  

* **For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences**  

* For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:  

* **For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:**  

* For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  

* He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.  

* He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.   

* **He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.**  

* **He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.**   

* He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  


In every stage of these Oppressions **We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury**. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  


Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  


We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,A quick point about the Second Amendment....,"**“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”**

There are lots of reasonable ways to interpret this language. But let me just say, a very reasonable interpretation of this would be that the “right to bear arms” is itself a function of the States ability to muster a militia in order to provide “security” for the state. Now, as it is, our modern American Nation state is perfectly capable of providing security for itself in a wholey different manner then was envisioned by the founders — namely through our standing professional armed forces (not to mention our modern incarnation of the militia - the National Guard).

Many so-called “Second Amendment” advocates have a very narrow reading of the Second Amendment and highlight only the second half of the provision, that is the ""right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed” half. To do so is to willfully take the language out of its proper context. There is a clear link between the right to arms and the security of the state, so clear that a reasonable interpretation would be that the right to arms exists in *order to defend the state*. Despite the fact that many American's reading of it is somewhat different -- that the provision is instead meant to protect Americans *from the state*. Given the language, this takes some serious mental gymnastics. 

Furthermore, what does “arms” even mean? If you accept that narrow reading and claim that “bearing arms” is an absolute, then shouldn’t Americans have the right to bear nukes, tanks, bombers, munition laden drones, and fighter jets? I mean, these would be the “Arms” needed to hedge against the specter of tyranny from a state backed by the most advanced military in human history (small arms would be small potatoes). If you say that its ridiculous that ""Arms"" should be read to include such weaponary, then you acknowledge that the statute is *not* an absolute and which “arms” are acceptable is interpretable and open for debate... Suddenly, limiting high-capacity magazines and military assault weapons doesn't seem so ridiculous (let alone unconstitutional).

**UPDATE:** Thank you everybody who has contributed to this thread. It has been **extremely** informative! I am entering Law School this Fall and have not yet studied the nuance of the language as established by 200+ years of Supreme Court jurisprudence. My reading was a layman's interpretation of the amendment given it's language -- and by that standard I maintain the interpretation is sound. However, as has been a common thread amongst the responses, I have come to learn that each and every word used in the amendment has been explored and unpacked by the Supreme Court and further defined and extrapolated upon (often in ways you would not expect -- but who am I to challenge the combined wisdom of the Highest Court in the Land). I do maintain my reluctance to use interpretation of *founders intent* as a means to determine what the law is or isnt... I find that to be an incredibly treacherous prospect. The onus is on the lawmakers to craft the language so that their intent is unmistakable. The law is whats written. Not what we think their reasons for writing the law were. So, I will learn more in Law School, but I can say that today I am no Scalia Originalists and I can certainly respect that many words (like ""liberty"" for instance) require the Court to interpret -- as they have done with the 2nd Amendment.

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,Would an Australian-style gun control with buyback program work here in America? ,"> Unlike the voluntary buybacks in the United States, Australian gun buybacks of 1996 and 2003 were compulsory, compensated surrenders of newly-illegal firearms.

>The 1996 Buyback took 600,000 newly illegal sporting firearms, including all semi-automatic rifles including .22 rimfires, semi-automatic shotguns and pump-action shotguns. Because the Australian Constitution prevents the taking of property without just compensation the Federal Government decided to put a 1% levy on income tax for one year to finance the compensation. The buyback was predicted to cost A$500 million and had wide community support.[5]

>The 2003 handgun buyback compensated the confiscation of about 50,000 newly illegal pistols, the majority being target arms of greater than 9mm calibre (generally used for IPSC competition), or smaller handguns with barrels less than 4"" such as pocket pistols, ... [Wikipedia]

I'm picking Australia because it seems to be the most similar country to America. There's lots of people that say you can't compare Sweden to America because their populations are too different or they don't have to worry about the cops being 20 minutes away. Lots of ""they're just too different compared to America"" when you say that doing X worked in Country Y. 

Arguments for: 

- Australia is similar to America in that we have no enemies on our borders and a substantial rural population
- ""Though gun-related deaths did not suddenly end in Australia, gun-related homicides dropped 59 percent between 1995 and 2006, with no corresponding increase in non-firearm-related homicides."" [CSM]
- Australia has a similar ""frontier"" spirit

Arguments against: 

- the buyback program would be unconstitutional 
- the buyback program would not work because there are so many more guns in America (can't find any numbers before 2007, but as of 2007 it was 88/per in US and 15/per in AUS)
- outlawing guns would result in bloodshed when people refuse to give up their weapons
- it would be too expensive
- it would put citizens too much at the mercy of their government (defense against tyranny) 

I suppose the first point is the biggest roadblock. ",35,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/15epz3/would_an_australianstyle_gun_control_with_buyback/,1356412269.0,15epz3

I have no idea who wrote this, and I haven't responded. It's terrifying to me that someone so adamant about keeping guns can be so completely removed from sanity. And it worries me that we won't ever be able to have a reasonable conversation. What to do about guns, and what to do about mental health care, are not easy issues that we are going to solve in one fell swoop. But we will never be able to do anything about them so long as misinformation and scare tactics  remain the means to control the conversation.



I don't personally claim to have any answers. But I recognize that we have a problem.

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,"All right guys, please change my mind.","All the political discussion I see is either bickering back and forth about how the other is wrong, or a circle jerk.  I want to see people actually changing their minds about things, including me.

No matter what, I can't seem to justify from a moral standpoint, any sort of tyranny that hinders our freedom.  As long as you're not initiating force against someone or their property, I don't see how it's acceptable to use force against them.

Like a business charging a ridiculously high amount of money for a product/service, and/or paying their own employees a ridiculously low wage and offering no benefits.  I get how people don't like that, and they shouldn't like it.  The thing is, if people want to pay for that product/service, then I can't justify saying that they absolutely cannot.  Nobody forces them to pay, if they don't value the product/service more than their money, then clearly they won't be spending the money on it.

Same thing with an employee.  Nobody forces them to work there, with freedom they're always welcome to try and find employment elsewhere, start their own business, or whatever else they'd like.

Interfering with either of these processes is saying that consenting adults aren't allowed to partake in certain activities.  Whether it be buying/selling goods, having certain forms of sex, taking drugs, it's all the same morally to me.

I get that people have practical arguments, but I really need to stick to the moral argument, as all practical arguments I've seen get bogged down in unimportant details and way too much headache.  I understand concerns like ""what about roads/healthcare/etc...?""  There are answers to all those questions, but that's a completely different discussion.

So, morally, why is it a good thing to use force to prevent people from making voluntary/consensual choices?  Help me to understand this and I'll be quite happy.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/14fmhl/all_right_guys_please_change_my_mind/,1354864057.0,14fmhl
tyranny,politicaldiscussion,Repeal the 22nd Amendment now!,"An Appeal for Repeal

of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America, for preventing the rights of the people from lapsing into the custodianship of someone who might not respect those rights.

It's a melancholic thing to consider, so soon after another successful presidential election, that the 22nd Amendment prevents our presidents from being elected to more than two terms in office.  This is a matter of some serious urgency, now, given the current laws and circumstances of our great country.

The 22nd Amendment codified into law the convention, established by George Washington and adhered to by 150 years of presidents, of limiting the president to a maximum of two four-year terms.  After Franklin D Roosevelt was elected to four consecutive terms, the people were motivated to ensure that no one man would be allowed to stay in office for more than two terms.

Of course, FDR was president during extraordinary times in our nation's history.  It would not have been prudent to oust him after just two terms, in 1940, with the nation in the early stages of a fragile economic recovery from the Great Depression and FDR promising to keep the United States out of World War II even as it exploded across Europe.  By the time the election of 1944 rolled around, replacing FDR and his administration in the White House was unthinkable—we were at war in Europe and in the Pacific and the future of global civilization was hanging in the balance.

In the years after the Roosevelt administration, perhaps in part in reaction to the evidence—presented in stark relief by both allies and enemies of the United States in World War II—that a single unchecked individual with a tyrannical inclination could wield massive influence and power over entire continents, Congress passed the 22nd Amendment, and it was ratified by the necessary number of States in 1951.

The 22nd Amendment was the right thing for the country at the time it was proposed and ratified, but just as the Constitution is not written in stone, and must be amended and reinterpreted to keep pace with the changing times, so too must we revisit, modify, or do away with some of those changes as our society continues to evolve.

The terrorist attacks on the United States of America on the morning of September 11, 2001 brought about a paradigm shift in the scope and authority of the federal government, forever changing the way Americans think about and relate to the national state.  9/11, and the way we responded to it, effectuated legislation to reflect that new understanding and relationship.  I believe the time has come to amend the Constitution to bring it more in line with our post-9/11 twenty-first century American reality.

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act—the USA PATRIOT Act, for short—was signed into law by President George W Bush on October 26, 2001.  The Act was designed to make it easier for the FBI and other police agencies in the US to surveil, charge, and convict people suspected of committing, or planning to commit, terrorism.  In order to keep the vast majority of law-abiding citizens safe from the threat of terrorism, the Patriot Act necessarily plays a little fast and loose with the Bill of Rights, especially the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution.  Some critics have said that the Patriot Act, as applied by law enforcement agencies and the government, has infringed on some suspects' constitutional rights, mostly in terms of unreasonable searches and warrantless surveillance by the government.

Some of the Patriot Act's harshest initial critics, however, have come to see that the safety and security benefits that the Patriot Act has for the vast majority of citizens outweighs whatever harm it does in temporarily waiving the rights of terrorism suspects.  President Obama, for example, a former constitutional law professor and one-time president of the Harvard Law Review, once opposed the Patriot Act on civil liberties grounds, but came to believe that the benefits of the Act outweighed the risks, and voted for its extension when he was in the Senate and also, as President, signed a four-year extension of the Act in 2011.  Despite controversy that nothing had been done to limit the Act's more liberties-infringing provisions, President Obama recognized that no matter the consequences on the individual liberties of terrorism suspects, the Patriot Act was too valuable a tool for ensuring the safety and security of Americans to allow the law to expire.

The Military Commissions Act was passed in 2006 to provide a legislative framework for the anti-terrorism policies already being practiced by the Bush administration, the Department of Justice, and the government's various enforcement agencies.  In order to keep Americans safe, it was necessary to keep the trials and charges of people that the Administration deemed “unlawful enemy combatants” a secret, by trying them in military tribunals rather than in civilian courts.  The Act also made it easier for government agents to obtain crucial intelligence from detainees by making it harder to later prosecute and convict those agents of war crimes.  While some critics claimed that the Act was retroactively forgiving and endorsing physically coercive interrogation techniques, Congress and the President found that concerns about civil liberties were outweighed by the safety and security that the Act bestowed upon the vast majority of Americans.  The Act was renewed in 2009 as part of that year's National Defense Authorization Act and signed by President Obama amid concerns that despite some tweaking, the Act might be enforced in such a way as to infringe on the rights guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, signed by President Obama on December 31, 2011, received some attention from civil liberties watchdog groups, as well.  Some critics claimed that the bill explicitly allowed for the indefinite detention of US citizens and non-citizens without charge or trial, and that the NDAA effectively upended the Constitutionally-guaranteed rights of Americans to due process.

While those sorts of issues will no doubt be settled in various federal appeals courts in the years to come, it's important to remember that even though the NDAA, the Military Commissions Act, and the Patriot Act appear to, in certain cases, supersede and therefore invalidate the rights guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, President Obama has promised that the most controversial provisions of these acts will not be used against American citizens.  He has personally guaranteed it, and put it in writing in the form of various signing statements.  Our rights are secure, no matter what the various laws say, because President Obama has said so.

This isn't just about legislation, though.  President Obama has also taken personal responsibility for authorizing drone strikes in foreign countries, making decisions about which of our individual enemies will live or die, something the New York Times called the President's “kill list.”  There is a data center being built in Utah, run by the National Security Agency, that will function as the nation's primary intelligence-gathering resource, and will house the details of every cell phone call, text, e-mail, internet search, and browsing history of every person in the country, to build a trackable, personalized digital fingerprint of everyone through their interactions with the digital world.  The center will also focus on code-breaking, as the NSA attepts to use the next generation of supercomputers to fight internet data encryption being used by people who are potential national security threats.

We were all taught, growing up, that the government doesn't create or grant our fundamental rights, but that the government is there to respect and protect those rights.  In a post 9/11 America in which we have necessarily centralized power and handed the custodianship of our fundamental rights into the authority of one man, currently President Obama, we can't very well afford to be forced to replace that one man every four or eight years.  We have been incredibly lucky with Presidents Bush and Obama—we granted them unprecedented access to upend our rights, and they have not abused that power.  Why roll the dice again so soon, with a new president, if we don't have to?

Most everyone has heard Benjamin Franklin's oft trotted-out quote, “They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.”  That was a different time, and practically an entirely different world.  If the liberties that we are “giving up” are being guarded by someone we can trust, someone who has already proven through one four-year term that we can rely on him to protect the rights of American citizens and at the same time keep us safe, the only way we could truly put those rights and liberties at risk would be to force ourselves to put someone else in charge.  We have charged President Obama with the awesome authority to contravene our most sacredly held rights, and he has not seen fit to do so.  Whoever the next president is might not have the same healthy respect for our fundamental rights.  We must repeal the 22nd Amendment so that, at the very least, we can put off the day when we have to enshrine that authority in another individual.

The 22nd Amendment, once a well-intentioned bulwark against tyranny and the threat of a creeping cult-of-personality megalomania in the White House, is now an anachronistic hindrance to true liberty and security in modern America.  The First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution are what is at stake, here.  Do we really want to sacrifice all of those, and the rights that they protect, because of the pesky and antiquated Twenty-Second Amendment?

I profess, in the sincerity of my heart, that I have no stake, personal or financial, in the outcome of any effort to repeal the 22nd Amendment, nor any connection to a potential future Obama reelection campaign effort, and have no other motive than the public good of my country.  Repeal it now.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/13biu2/repeal_the_22nd_amendment_now/,1353101538.0,13biu2

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,Please tell me why immigration is such an issue for our country,"(now that the election is over...)

I don't get it, obviously.

To me, it seems we would want to welcome anyone and everyone from anywhere and everywhere.  More people = more sampling of talent and intelligence = more progress.  The definition of progress, admittedly hard to pin down, is essentially 'improvement over the status quo' right?

So far, we (the public) have only been told that immigration is a problem, and if you distill it down to the fundamentals it seems there are two majors: input and output.  How people come, and how people leave, this country, is what immigration reform seems to be all about (including things like border patrol, visas, passports/ids, other control mechanisms).  Output is pretty simple, if even included, but input is another matter all together.

So why do we put such an emphasis on the input side?  It's insane to me to think about borders as more than arbitrary lines on a map; in fact, I have a problem with borders to begin with, so that's not surprising.  It seems to me that anyone has the freedom to walk this earth, or should, and as such should not be denied access to a region of the planet simply because it's marked as ""owned"" by some other group of people.

I know, security is a problem.  We're all worried about unknowns entering this great land and taking out their revenge against us for whatever their reasons are, so yes perhaps there's work to be done there (without violating everyone's basic civil rights, regardless of your country of origin).  But is it worth it?  Is it worth it to send a helicopter out to the Mexican border to shoot down innocent people who are simply trying to come to a better place, to improve themselves, to progress?  Isn't that what this nation is all about?  I mean, it's not as if efforts to-date have stopped the influx of new folks to this country.  Much like the War on Drugs, it's an epic failure in my eyes.

""Resources"" you say? I hear you.  We're a growing country of our own, I understand that.  We have a finite amount of space and resources, and our infrastructure is already being outgrown by our home-grown reproduction efforts (read as, breeders).  You could even count jobs as a resource, albeit an abstract resource, and one which is hotly contested everywhere of course.  That gets us to the big 'E', the Economy, which some argue would be absolutely ruined by displacing ""hard-working Americans"" with low-wage imported workers.  It's a direct assault on the increasing diversity that this country faces going forward, and that is an unstoppable machine (in my opinion, for the better).

This is a policy problem; when you let free-wheeling corporations which (note I did not say, ""who"") support thousands of American livelihoods with a paycheck, run rampant with work visas and outsourcing, you're letting the system beat its own participants, the employees (upper management notwithstanding of course).  If corporation A pays its American worker $30/hr for manufacturing, but can get the same quality for $10/hr outside the US, of course they're going to go there. Likewise if a corporation can pay an illegal immigrant less (because they're suppressed to the point of taking ANY job they can find, because they're ""illegally"" here, aka self deportation) than an American worker, a corporation will (up to the point of litigation or liability of course; think migrant workers on farms, for example).  No one at GM is sitting around thinking about how they can get more illegal workers on the Chevy Silverado manufacturing line (especially GM, for that matter). Can you see the simplicity in the solution to this?  We need more corporate control and oversight, with punishment and incentives (tax breaks) for those corporations willing to go the extra mile to protect our economy.  Free markets don't allow for this sort of thing of course, they'd rather wildly expand and make profits to the point of their own downfall.

Yes, I said ""our economy"".  Surely a conflict with my opinion on borders and immigration, allow me to explain.  We live in a world, but that world is divided by borders.  As such, the ""economy"" is still mostly local to our nation, and even our states and counties and cities.  And we must not forget we live in a local world, internet aside, where things that happen locally or day-to-day are what matter to each of us the most, and things that happen elsewhere only register a faint blip on the ""concern radar"".  We're inherently selfish in this respect, and I think that reflects in our immigration policies as a nation.  So when I say ""our economy"", I simply mean that the buck stops at the borders, when it comes to economic policy and direction.  Sure, big things can happen that affect many nations and indeed, the world, at one time.  I'm not refuting that fact; I'm simply saying we still measure the economy here by local indices (DJIA, S&P, Nasdaq) and local reports (employment, housing, manufacturing, etc.).  When a forest falls in Indonesia, we don't lament the loss of those resources because it's *not here in our country*, but we certainly should.

Back to immigration, let us not forget that humans do not live forever, and we aren't talking about early-1900's levels of immigration.  Furthermore, we're already relying on technology to maximize our resources.  So what gives?  What are we protecting?

To me, stopping immigration seems an inane waste of funds, time, effort, and risk to continue our assault against immigrants.  Every human should have the same rights globally, not just within country borders.  Obviously some radical countries are to be avoided; tyranny still exists, and just as much as you have the free will to roam where you like (or should), you have the ability to avoid conflicts in places where they could become problematic.  A natural deal, if you will.

The bottom line, in my opinion, is that 'immigration control' or 'reform' is but a result of racism and so-called ""patriotism"", elitism even, essentially putting the American public ahead and above of anyone not originating here.  Let people come to America, put a process in place to get them some identification, and let them pursue their dream.  I was fortunate enough to start here in the US, but I can't imagine how difficult it is to simply exist, let alone progress in life, for someone who wasn't.  It's gut-wrenching at times and makes me question the very direction of our own nation, a core direction I might add.  Let us not forget exactly who came to this land in the first place, displacing an existing population and culture.  Let us not forget the ideals that this republic was founded upon, and by whom.  We are all just imports or the result of immigration (save for Native Americans, and rightfully so).

Obama's 2012 campaign doesn't even mention *""hope""* and *""change""*, the very theme and justification of his 2008 candidacy and Presidency. This is evidence of a demagogue using ""feel good"" words that had no substance, upon the gullible to gain power in order to replace freedom with socialist tyranny.

America's constitutional republic has made it the land of the free and the home of the brave and the greatest county in the world. Obama's failed administration and socialist agenda is and has proven to be **HOPELESS** and America desperately needs a **CHANGE**.

We are now hard left, and we will, of course, pay a very heavy price for this decision. It appears to be what the people want though.

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,"A length discussion between me and a conservative friend, advice and comments welcome","I just had a fairly long political discussion with a friend over facebook, and he broke it off in my opinion prematurely, as it was only just starting to get good (discussing the ROLE of government, etc).

Who do you agree with? What other points could be made for either side? How did you find the tone of the discussion? Is this how your discussions with those holding other views usually go?

Convo:
[It began when he posted the following article on his wall: 
http://cedars.cedarville.edu/article/481/Why-I-am-Not-Voting-for-Romney
with the caption: ""So glad I don't go to Cedarville. This is pathetic.""]

Me: I just read the article you posted from Cedarville Uni. Why do you find it pathetic?

Him: Because they clash with Conservative Christian values, and that is supposed to be a Conservative Christian school.

Me: How do they clash with Christian Values? Caring for the poor?

Him: You missed the second part, namely, conservative. The bible tells indivuduals to help the poor, not for governments to redistribute wealth, which is what welfare is. Let people help, not government

Me: A government ""of the people, by the people, for the people"". Shouldn't the government then reflect the values of its citizens? If we as citizens value helping those who are less fortunate than us, shouldn't the government then carry that value as well?

Why are you so against welfare? There are people in need. Sure, ideally it is the role of the church to care for the poor, and occasionally this works, but as the whole, the church has dropped the ball, and the government is stepping in for those in need.

I've heard the argument before that welfare is just a government handout, a free pass for the lazy, but I think this is an extremely unfair characterization of those on welfare. For example, look at this article from a NY Times blog: http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/paying-rent-on-minimum-wage/

There isn't a single state where you can work a 40 hour week at a minimum wage job and still make the rent. The average welfare recipient isn't a lazy slacker who refuses to work and would rather scrape by on the taxpayers' dollars, it's people who are working hard, but in a system hostile to them. Without higher education, it's extremely difficult to find jobs that pay more, so those who are disadvantaged end up working jobs that are going nowhere, with no hope for improvement, and still not enough money to pay the rent! Throw a kid or two in there, and the situation becomes even more dire.

To me it seems almost unbelievably cold and heartless to want to reduce welfare programs, especially while proclaiming a faith like Christianity - allegedly so intent on helping those in need.

Him: A Government of the people and by the people means it is duly elected by the people and does not commit tyranny against them. This does not mean they take on the ROLE of the people. A Government taking money from one group to give to another is theft, and should not be tolerated. 

Because it is not the Government's job to do that. Besides, a Government powerful enough to give you what you want is powerful enough to take it all the way. The Government shouldn't have this power. 

I'm not saying welfare is only for lazy people (though many who do use it could easily go without it) the only point is that it is not Government's job, never has been and constitutionally never will be.

I'm certainly no economist, and make no claims to be. I haven't suggested raising the minimum wage, I'm simply pointing out an egregious problem with the current state of affairs, and a great injustice for many of our fellow Americans.

You note that the government isn't supposed to take on the role of the people, sure. But right in the opening lines it states that, 

""We the people [...] in order to [...] promote the general Welfare [...] establish this Constitution.""

That is describing the role of the government. The goal should be to raise the quality of life for all Americans, not just those who are born into a family of wealth and have the opportunity for advancement and education.

What about ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness""? This is supposed to be the Land of Opportunity, how then have we let a situation develop which is oppressing the lower class? Those with no hope of improvement, no where to go. In America we love the idea of pulling oneself up by your bootstraps - we love a self-made man - but that's becoming less possible now. Those who are so drawn out, working two jobs, struggling to pay the rent, where now is their right to the Pursuit of Happiness? As a country, we have failed them. 

Which makes a larger impact on your right of Pursuit of Happiness, taking 5% more of your net earnings when you're making over a million dollars a year, or giving you a couple hundred dollars a month when you're just struggling to get by?

Him: You said ""There isn't a single state where you can work a 40 hour week at a minimum wage job and still make the rent."" I was agreeing, I was saying minimum wage is part of the problem. 

Yes, but general welfare as a specific meaning to the founders, namely, infrastructural. Not wealth redistribution, not monetary welfare. 

Again, it is up to the individual to help the poor. If the Government would end welfare as we know it, stop its egregious spending and lower taxes, it would be much easier for everyone to thrive. Welfare is part of the oppression on the poor, especially since Obama gutted the work requirement. Government needs to get the heck out of the way. 

Happiness doesn't have to be monetary, just ask the the people who are in third world countries with nothing and still rejoice. According to the founders, pursuing happiness is doing the morally right thing. 

You are right, we have failed them, we have failed them by letting Government over tax, over spend, and involve itself in places they don't belong which is what brought on all this crap. 

""Which makes a larger impact on your right of Pursuit of Happiness, taking 5% more of your net earnings when you're making over a million dollars a year, or giving you a couple hundred dollars a month when you're just struggling to get by?""

Doesn't matter, what matters is that the Government has ZERO right to take money from the rich to give to the poor, or vice versa. 

The role of Government constitutionally is to provide for the common defense, punish lawbreakers, provide infrastructure. Not to cradle anyone, not to take care of anyone. Leave it up to individuals and charities and they will do the job fine.

Me: ""Leave it up to individuals and charities and they will do the job fine."" History would seem to disagree with you. It appears more often people are willing to climb over other people to get ahead, rather than stopping to pull them up to where they are. 

I think that having a safe and clean place to live, and access to reasonable health care are both basic human rights. The government should seek to restore human rights to its citizens whenever and wherever it seems them lacking.

You mention that the government has ""over spent, and involved itself in places it doesn't belong."" Do you also support extreme reduction of military spending and our withdrawal from unnecessary military installments, or from Afghanistan? 

I would also submit these two links for consideration:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_deployments
On this page, note the bar graph figures:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures

Him: American History agrees with me, given that we are the most charitable nation ever. 

Afghanistan and those other military deployments are for the national defense and are needed and justified. Constitutionally and logically these social programs are not, because they are not Government's role. That being said, I am all for cutting waste wherever it is found, including the military, but not an extreme reduction because we need a strong military. Heck, we could afford it if we cut the unconstitutional social spending programs. 

Look, we have different world views here: I believe like the founders, in limited Government, and personal responsibility/charity. You don't. Its as simple as that.

Me: ""I believe like the founders, in limited Government, and personal responsibility/charity. You don't. Its as simple as that.""

Whoa, ouch man. I absolutely believe in personal responsibility and charity. We ought to encourage people to be personally responsible, but this doesn't mean turning a blind eye to suffering and refusing to help when times are tough. I believe in charity, it's a wonderful thing and yes, maybe compared to other countries we do give more, but I don't believe that it's been enough on its own to make sure Americans have access to the rights promised by the Constitution. 

I believe in having a limited and non-invasive government, it should be as small as it needs to be. But to me, one of its fundamental roles is helping those who are less fortunate and have less opportunity. It should do this by increasing their ability to help themselves. Programs like housing subsidies and tuition aid for lower income families play a vital roll in this. I want everyone in America to have a fair and fighting chance in this life to be happy. I want them to be able to go into business, compete, and make a profit! America is a wealthy country, and I want to see her economic success distributed across the range of its workers. When America grows and is successful in the international economy, I want to see the quality of life, and the standard of living increase for all those who work for it, not just the top 1%. I'm not saying this has to be evenly distributed, it's fair for those who work hard, take risks, and are smiled on by fortune to do better than those who don't, but I'm just saying that it ought to trickle down. 

*Think about it like a company. It's started by one man, who owns it. He hires a bunch of people, and they are all working together to make the company succeed. Not in equal roles, there are managers, laborers, strategic planners, advertisers, everything. The company does well and is tremendously successful. I think that even the laborers on the bottom should see some of that benefit, even if it's small. Say, going from $7.25 an hour to $10 an hour for the guy driving the trucks. The company can afford it, it ought to bless that guy and let everyone enjoy the economic success the company has experienced.*

*But in terms of that analogy, the boss just maintained his full equity and solely reaped the benefits of the success. The day labors are no better off then when the company was struggling. The wealth from the economic success of the company has only exponentially increased the wealth of one person. This is greed, this is injustice. I'm not saying that every person, from the worker to the manager to the owner ought to receive an equal share, that's silly and it doesn't work, that would be socialism. I'm just saying that the disparities in wealth distribution shouldn't be as severe as they are here. No one gets wealthy all on their own, it's a community effort, and everyone who contributes ought to see some benefit from that, not just the owner and the CEO's who line their pockets becoming billionaires while everyone else struggles, despite the tremendous success of the company.*

That was wordy and long, but I hope the analogy makes sense.

Him: Turning a blind eye? Government doing its job is not turning a blind eye....[Me], you are suggesting that the Government do the job of the individual by providing welfare; even though welfare is theft. 

Well, thats not it's constitutional role, nor should it be because all it will do is grow bigger in the name of helping people. 

It is not governments job to take from rich to give to poor, no matter how much the rich can ""afford it"", its theft, pure and simple. The Government is not a company, it is not there to ensure everyone gets a profit, that is up to individuals and the market. If anything, Government is the referee who only blows the whistle when the law is broken. 

I'm ending this discussion here cause it is simply a world view difference that will not change.

Me: I'm sorry we couldn't find any common ground. I'd hoped we could at least agree on something.

And honestly, I don't think it's a difference of worldview. I'd like to believe that we both want the same things, for ourselves and for everyone: love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. 

We both want to see the sick taken care of, the widows and the poor provided for. We want to see suffering and injustice lessened, at home and abroad. We want safety, security, and prosperity for ourselves, and all men. Surely you agree with these? I believe anyone who follows the teachings of Christ is obligated to. 

I hope that our only difference is in how we think these goals can best be accomplished. I see the government as a tool of great potential in aiding these goals, whereas you, (I believe), are offended by it (forcing your hand, so to speak - welfare as theft, instead of charity), as you feel it should be the sole responsibility of individuals to bring them about.

I don't think this should be as divisive as it seems to be. I'm sorry you don't wish to continue the discussion, as I've enjoyed it thus far. In my view it's been very civil, but perhaps you've found it boring and unproductive.

I wish you the best, and I respect your opinions. I hope we have ended with some agreement however.

-[Me]

**Edit: TL;DR: Welfare - is it stealing? Or is it a program that helps to reduce suffering? Is it the role of the government to *make* people be charitable by taxing them and helping the people they're shitting on, or should people be free to be greedy and shit on whoever they want?**

Note: to get a slightly less short tl;dr, start at the italicized block and read the last couple paragraphs.

tyranny,politicaldiscussion,"Bin Laden May Be Dead, but His Mission Accomplished Banner Is Flying High. Pt. 2"," Interestingly, a New York Times columnist wrote, “Experts said Bin-Laden had been a largely symbolic figure in recent years who had little if any direct role in spreading terrorism worldwide.” (Schmitt) Acting as the devil’s advocate for a moment, I must say that it’s obvious that Bin-Laden’s assassination itself would be a symbolic message to all the so-called terrorists out there. However, Bin-Laden is supposedly a murderer of thousands in the past and possibly the future, yet he was simply shot through the eye rather than questioned, tried, and sentenced like any other human being should be. This fact seems to degrade the argument of keeping the terrorist prisoners in Guantanamo Bay as well. Those men were deprived of all sensory information and basically tortured for information for years through various inhumane techniques, and yet the man behind the reason for it all didn’t know enough to get sent there? Other than this entire terrorism ploy being an excellent political tool for gaining presidential support and revamping nationalism, I personally believe that the killing of Bin-Laden has sinister implications.

   If Bin-Laden was as horrible and as much of an apparent mastermind as we have been told, then he had to have had a contingency for his demise. His money must have been allocated through some sort of network, and perhaps even holed up in Swiss accounts.  I realize that our SEAL team recovered intelligence from the operation, but it appears as though nothing that is truly valuable was found other than Bin-Laden’s personal diary and a large amount of flash drives. Apparently, “Intelligence officials have not identified any new planned targets or plots in their initial analysis of the 100 or so flash drives and five computers that Navy SEALs hauled away after killing bin Laden. Last week, the FBI and Homeland Security Department warned law enforcement officials nationwide to be on alert for possible attacks against trains, though officials said there was no specific plot.” (Herridge) Also, the hard drives probably just contain downloaded torrents of American and Middle Eastern music, movies, and TV shows as well as a small amount of useful intelligence. Most likely unsurprising to people familiar with the going-ons of homophobic politicians inside public restrooms or priests that turned out to be pedophiles, many news outlets and comedy shows would not let go that there was also plenty of pornography saved on the computers and flash drives. 

   Another possible yet extremely unpopular theory of mine is that Bin-Laden was simply a loose end that required dealing with. Too many billions of dollars have been made because of 9/11 and the following wars (Chatterjee) for me to have one hundred percent certainty that there wasn't any domestic foul play at hand. We probably can all guess what organized crime members do with snitches, and the greatest organized yet unorganized crime family known to man, aka the government, businesses, and institutions of the United States, did the exact same thing as Al Capone would have done; we put the hit on a potential rat. I’m not going to get into a debate about how guilty Osama Bin-Laden is for 9/11, I am merely pointing out how convenient his permanent silencing would be if we were lied to about even the slightest of details regarding his or others’ actions on that terrible day.

   Regardless of whether or not Bin-Laden was still an essential part of the Jihadist movement, terrorism is still a viable aspect of our lives. Indeed, the columnist Schmitt also said that, “ it [Bin-Laden’s death] will not end the threat from an increasingly potent and self-reliant string of regional [Al] Qaeda affiliates in North Africa and Yemen or from a self-radicalized vanguard here at home.” Schmitt conveniently left out the fact that people in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and other Muslim-majority countries either hate us or love us, meaning that they all don’t necessarily want our troops to remain on their turf. Our troop presence causes many Iraqis and Afghanis to have reason to hate America, and the idea that the United States, which cannot even get its own democracy to work smoothly, expects to get these two Muslim-majority countries to maintain a democratic government of our choosing is naïve and arrogant. Many people around the world worry that the United States has gone too far with its foreign policies, and it’s much too early to say that Bin Laden’s death is the end of terrorism as we know it. Unfortunately, it could be more accurately called the beginning of the montage of terrorism.

   It’d be fantastic if the United States’ need to be the leading world vigilante had nothing to do with insecurity and fear; thus, there is nothing that ought to be avoided but violence itself. Violence always begets violence, and it would be a good idea to never arm Bin-Laden or other rebels to fight what appears to be a more dangerous enemy. Supporting Afghanistan rather than abandoning it after it fought off the Soviets would have made huge differences as well. Alas, hindsight is the easiest aspect of speculation. We will never know for certain what other works Bin-Laden had planned, if he actually did everything we are told he did, or what was really going on in his mind. Once again the United States has arrogantly jumped around the world imposing its tyranny through its own justifiable vigilante-terrorism, and the costs up to this supposed victory are unfathomable amounts of money as well as over five thousand dead American troops, contractors, and journalists. Of course, the numbers of the dead are probably less than twenty percent of the number of shell-shocked or dismembered troops. An even less spoken about number is the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi and Afghan civilians killed through both our own drone attacks and the resulting terrorist suicide bombings. If those are all the costs of what we have accomplished overseas in the past ten years, the cost of us attempting to pay back the money we now owe could very well result in a much more dreadful war than anything we’ve ever known. Many steps must be taken to better ourselves and rise above the need for our offensive follies, but in the meantime, it may be best to simply begin using actual waiting defense rather than a moving offense to protect ourselves. Incidentally, if humankind is not already doomed for extinction as it is, it will be impossible to justify why our culture was ever so violent and insecure.

Gen-Z has already shown to be more socially progressive than past generations, and when paired with these factors, it is easy to understand why they are beginning to question the current state of capitalism. Nowadays, I constantly hear that Gen-Z is Socialist, but here in the United States, many tend to mash up definitions of socialism, marxism, communism, and social democracy because of, as I previously mentioned, decades of Red Scare propaganda along with Bernie Sanders calling himself a Democratic Socialist while running on a platform more reminiscent of social democracy.  

My question is, as Gen-Z moves to the left, are they truly 'socialist' or are they more 'social democratic' in a similar vein as Bernie? Obviously there are a number that fall into both ideologies, but which do you see as being a better representation of Gen-Z as a whole, and do you see that changing in the coming years.

propaganda,politicaldiscussion,What are your thoughts of Vladimir Putin's most recent speech?,"Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech that expressed his perception of a looming big war, stating that he feels threatened by the west. Putin highlighted the fact that the United States has bases around the world, which he claims is necessary to protect against countries that are building up military forces within their borders. He accused the west of lies, claiming that they are the ones who attacked, and seeing the Americans as dividing the world.

During his speech, Putin's tone was aggressive, and he presented a false narrative, denying Russia's attack on Ukraine and blaming the United States for the ongoing conflict. Putin justified his attack on Ukraine by accusing America of taking over. In addition, a woman in the crowd was wearing a blazer with the Z symbol on the right arm, which is no different from the Nazi symbol and is aimed to unite the people around a single ideology.

Putin reiterated that the longer the west continues to act in Ukraine, the longer they will be forced to avert danger approaching their borders. He added that Russia will logically respond to this. Putin emphasized that Russia is speaking about the existence of their country, which he claims is under threat.

During the speech, Putin also made an alarming comment suggesting that it's normal for people to be pedophiles in their countries, stating that ""It's their way of life."" Putin brought in religious quotes to unite his people with religion.

The speech delivered by Putin, with its false claims and divisive language, is seen by many as an example of wartime propaganda, intended to manipulate and control public opinion.

propaganda,politicaldiscussion,An Open Letter to the Men of America,"Dear American Men
Dear American Men:

The United States of America, and much of Western Civilization, has been suffering through what future historians will no doubt proclaim as “The Great Gender War”. The damage inflicted upon men – onerous divorce courts, unconscionable child custody and support laws, military deaths, prisons bursting with men for non-violent crimes, and this rape culture nonsense – has become a national disgrace. And we (Men) have done nothing about it.

For the past 10 years the American public has been subjected to a propaganda effort – much of it emanating out of the “Women’s Studies Programs” of our Universities – that would have made Joseph Goebbels proud. There is no sexual assault crisis and there is no gender pay gap. The “Women’s Studies Programs” made assertions out of the thin air that exists between their ears and proceeded to agitate for funding from political sources for “studies” designed, in advance, to “prove” their absurdities – and many of us fell for it.

These ""Women's Studies Programs"" deploy hundred of ""agenda editors"" to comb through Wikipedia and the Blogsphere, issuing edits where they can and ""denial of services"" attacks on those that oppose them. These are sick, sick people.

We are currently at risk of the most frightening power grab since mid-20th century Germany. Feminists and Leftists – Collectivists ALL - in the American Media have abdicated the responsibility that they have to the American people in favor of a mass propaganda and controlled information distribution effort. In the 1970’s investigative Journalists brought the light of day to the Nixon Administration’s roll in the Watergate affair and won the Pulitzer Prize for their efforts. Today’s media investigates and reports essentially nothing – they are nothing but “news” aggregators – of the wrong doing of the political Left and then sits back quietly while their political masters attempt to silence the only investigative journalist left on the planet. And not just silence him. The Feminist Queen wants to KILL him by drone strike.

The Internet news aggregators have silenced the “dead-tree newspaper” news outlets and their independent minds and thinkers. The Universities have silenced dissent, indoctrinating a new generation of serfs. Big Sister looms.

The vast majority of American men know all of this. What you may or may not know is that the Feminist Left’s lackeys in the media are doing everything that they can to suppress male voter enthusiasm and turnout. There is a concerted effort – “a vast Left Wing conspiracy” if you will – to convince you that Hillary Clinton has won and that Donald Trump has lost. If they convince you, this will be a foregone conclusion.

This is a gender war, and it will destroy what is left of our Freedom if we let it. It has NOTHING to do with “race” (whatever the heck “race” is. By the way, this has been written by a “White Man” that is married to, and has children with, a very “Not White Woman”). America’s Black Men have been sacrificed by the Feminists to fill America’s prisons for non-violent drug crimes. If just 15% of “Black Men” (whatever the heck “black” is) vote for Trump he will win the White House. If Trump wins only 69% of the “white male” vote (whatever the heck “white” is) he will lose the White House. If he wins 74% of the “white male” vote he will win the White House, with or without our “black” brothers. It is as simple as that. We MUST NOT allow the Feminist Left’s Media to suppress our vote. The Feminist Left will vote for their Feminist Queen even if she were to microwave a baby and have the video uploaded to Youtube, so don’t count on evidence of her crimes and incriminating emails of her corruption to change their minds. These people are not accessible to reason.

American Men, consider this and get out and vote. And ask the women that actually love their fathers, brothers, sons, and husbands to vote. If we get out and vote we will defeat the hate and evil that the Feminist Left – Socialists ALL – represents.

Yours in Freedom,

How would such an agency look, could it pass Congress if Kasich were elected, and what would be its foreign-policy impacts?","Disclaimer: Kasich is my favorite of the Final Five (Trump, Cruz, Kasich, Sanders, Clinton) candidates, but this is one thing about him that really bugs me.

>""U.S. public diplomacy and international broadcasting have lost their focus on the case for Western values and ideals and effectively countering our opponents' propaganda and disinformation,” Kasich said. “I will consolidate them into a new agency that has a clear mandate to promote the core, Judeo-Christian Western values that we and our friends and allies share: the values of human rights, the values of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of association."" He said the main areas of the world he would target would be Russia, China and the Middle East.

>“Its job would be fundamentally to revive what we used to do when we beamed messages into the former Soviet Union. We need to beam messages around the world about what it means to have Western ethics … to be part of a Judeo-Christian society,” he said.

>What about the Western values of Muslims, atheists and others in the U.S.? Kasich was asked.

>“I also think that we have many moderate Muslims who share our views … there are many of them that stand up and speak out and they should be included in this and they’d be a very effective part of this,” he responded. “It’s essential that we do promote this message. It’s essential by the way that those in the West begin to embrace again our Jewish-Christian tradition rather than running from it, hiding from it.”

To me at least, its sounds like it's constitutionally questionable as formulated and I'd imagine that it would go over like a lead balloon in much of the Middle East as well as in Russia (seems to imply that Russians are not Judeo-Christian) and China (major US trading partner, officially atheist with a Buddhist-Taoist-Confucian background) and could alienate some US allies. Do you believe Kasich intended to describe it in a sectarian fashion and would Congress pass a plan that was explicitly tagged with religious traditions?

propaganda,politicaldiscussion,"If you had told me a few months ago that propaganda was capable of convincing perhaps millions of people that one of the top neurosurgeons in the world is an idiot, I would have thought you were crazy.","It's seriously mind-boggling to me how many people accept the notion that Ben Carson is an idiot.  If you ask the majority of users in /r/politics, they would tell you that it is possible to have been the principal neurosurgeon during the first successful attempt at separating cranially-conjoined twins, while at the same time being unable to comprehend basic concepts like interest rates and the debt ceiling.  That being the director of pediatric neurosurgery at one of the top hospitals in the world makes you a good neurosurgeon but a complete dunce in every other aspect of life.

People, he is running for president of the United States and he will need the support of most republican voters in order to get there.  How does he gain the support of voters?  He tells the voters what the voters want to hear, while not challenging the core belief systems of those voters.  Carson needs to appeal to average republicans, who are roughly as intelligent as average users in /r/politics.  And I would argue that his neurosurgery career will be an asset that allows him to get away with more pandering than usual while still maintaining the support of more educated republicans.  His accomplishments will leave much less doubt as to whether he actually is pandering, compared to if Bush or Rubio attempted the same rhetoric.  

It's actually a brilliant strategy if I understand it correctly.  His credibility with more educated voters as a world-renowned neurosurgeon gives him wider latitude to speak on the level of the average republican voter, without alienating those more educated voters.  They just assume he is pandering to win voter support.  If any of the other candidates tried to speak on the level of average republican voters, more of the educated voters might think they are being sincere (although Cruz has a similar ability to speak at the level of average republicans while maintaining credibility, being a Harvard Law grad and former clerk for Chief Justice Rehnquist).",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3rccfk/if_you_had_told_me_a_few_months_ago_that/,1446551689.0,3rccfk
propaganda,politicaldiscussion,"Putin wants another cold war, how can The West avoid giving it to him?","Watching the entire annexation of Crimea into Russia from the perspective of a dual citizen is a strange one. And I've watched both the Russian state media, and feel as if I have a good feel of what narrative they want, and I've watched and read Western media, and while it's obvious that their media is more open, there still is political posturing occurring on that side as well. 

I feel that one of the most overlooked parts of this whole story is that Putin wants to act as if there is Western aggression. He wants there to be a new cold war. Why? Well Russia's economy wasn't every strong to begin with. It's still basically a 2nd World country (Or maybe a 3rd world nation) the average monthly wage there is around 700$ and the average lifespan is like 60. Corruption is rampant everywhere, and one can be faced with having to bribe people on everything from getting admitted to a college to wanting to open a shop.  Remember, this type of corruption was the same thing that created the tipping point situation in Ukraine.  Therefore it was immediately important to stress that the revolution in Ukraine wasn't about people standing up to a corrupt system and removing an absolutely corrupt leader, but instead a violent coup perpetuated by Nazis funded by the US. This may sound like something from Alex Jones, but it's actually a pretty common belief. At this point, in their minds, pretty much everything bad that happens involving Russias is the work of Western covert agents. The Tartar who was tortured and killed in Crimea for being against Putin? Most believe he was killed by Ukrainian nationalists trying to frame Russians and make them look bad. At this point everything is the fault of the West, and that's just what Putin wants, and needs to stay in power. Seriously, you wouldn't believe the amount of anti-American and anti-European attitudes on Russian state media (which is now the only media) .

On top of that there are serious ethnic problems in Russia between native Russians and ""Kavkaz"" (non natives.. In their eyes at least) . Then of course there are obvious problems between Russians and Chechens, Ingush, Dagestanis, and Central Asians. Putin needs to ""Unite"" the country somehow, and The West is the perfect target. 

And lastly, Russia is simply an incredibly depressing place. Don't get me wrong it's totally unique and badass in a multitude of ways, and has an amazing history. But at the same time, it's just fucking depressing. There's a reason why a lot of people with money or upward mobility are fleeing the country, and that's because there simply isn't a lot of opportunity. But instead of blaming the oligarchs in power, you guessed it, the blame is on The West, once again. 

So, in my opinion the best tactic would be for US and their European Allies to engage in would be one that doesn't give Putin what he wants (which I believe they currently are doing). However, I don't know a viable alternative to sanctions, and travel bans. However I feel that at the same time they will feed into the same propaganda outlets which want to shift the blame for all their ills on America and Obama.

TLDR: Putin needs the US and an ""Us vs Them"" narrative to push in order to keep his power and his people in check. Without the bogeyman of the West, the people may start blaming their own leaders, and their own government for the problems in their lives.

Over and over i see these situations where children are tried criminally for bullying and all i have to say is enough is enough. Bullying is not a crime, it is an American institution. How many of our ancestors who knew lavish success and raised wonderful families bullied other children during their immature youth? For how long will the pitchforking of a group of insecure children who in their immaturity are mean to others commence? What real crime could have ensued; what absolute need is there to punish these two children 12 and 14 in ways that will effect them negatively for their entire lives? What is the ultimate goal of society here? Is society really so decadent to the point of feeling that systematically institutionalizing a vast portion of itself is justified as a means social reinforcement? We are more twisted and sick than any wicked witch in any scary fairytale. We are worse than any Orwellian propaganda state. Systematically eliminating marginal populace to ensure control; letting our kin serve as example to define our social structure. Of all the false wars this country has started, of all the financial fraud committed by tax payers and tax spenders alike, this takes the cake as the very worst example of what bureaucracy will eventually evolve into. This is a wake up call America, what you are doing right now to these two innocent children who are now convicted felons is the final proof that America has hit a level of decadence of proportions unfathomable outside of lore. Imagine for a moment if your great great grandparents in their worst moments of youth were tried for the crime of being immature. Instead of providing to heirs through the institution of the estate assets of equity which would eventually lead to the prosperity of dozens of descendants what if society decided that for the crime of being human and making mistakes that it was justified that our descendant be barred from obtaining a state marriage license for a record of criminal misconduct. What if an entire dynasty of influential doctors, lawyers, bankers, politicians, merchants, producers, ambassadors, and inventors were never born because of the actions of one hormone fueled teenager. This is a wake up call to the citizens of America. We no longer live in a world where life is sacred, where life has purpose. We have entered the twilight zone where institutions exist to process your children as nothing but numbers and meat. Discipline no longer serves the purpose of instilling maturity in the youth of today. The system of institutionalization is now larger than the cause for implementation. Your child is seen as a product of industry in which the purpose of the institutionalization of the marginal product of society is the perpetuation of the institutions themselves that seek to profit through the enslavement of another class. We now live in the era of the bureaucratic social worker. A time when four out of thirty students sitting in a classroom will grow up to depend on the continued enslavement through institutionalization of the peers sitting in their children's classrooms for the very food that rests on the plates of their own children.

This is troubling for a few reasons, besides the obvious ""hostage tactics"" currently being employed by the GOP. 

1) It relies on the fact that the voters are either misinformed by the right wing echo chamber, or too stupid/uninformed to actually research the matter in depth. (which speaks volumes about what they really think about their constituencies) 

2) Boehner will be safe because of these tactics, and is playing the game right for himself. If he actually does call a vote, and you know, let democracy run its course the Republicans would be in the minority.  This makes the party look bad to a majority of Americans, however, Boehner will most likely survive the storm. So in his mind ""who cares"".

3)  The shutdown showcases the power of misinformation and propaganda tactics. I know propaganda is a strong word, but we all know that companies buy ads because they work.  While the Republicans know that they're currently losing the popularity battle, they also know they'll probably bounce back, and people will forget about it by the next election.

So what do you think it means for a democracy (ok...ok a Republic) to be able to have a large part of the population coerced by propaganda and misinformation. Looking at Fox News will give you a quick glimpse into how the issue is being spun with even a new rebranding effort ( [slimdown!](http://imgur.com/QRd593A) ) being put in place. Buzzwords like this are absolutely crafted to deceive (and most likely the work of Frank Luntz), since people generally think about ""slimming down"" and how this is a good thing, there's no doubt in my mind that this term was focus grouped and discussed by various think tanks before it was rolled out, and wrote/spoken about countless times since it was decided to be used.

Basically, Congress is where justice goes to die, in the loving arms of lawyers who churn out hundreds of thousands of pages of meaningless legal jargon, sprinkled with landmines of corrupt corporate loopholes.

Take the [halliburton loophole](http://www.independentwatertesting.com/education-center/148-what-is-the-halliburton-loophole.html) for instance ([and an example of propaganda where they claim the halliburton somehow doesn't exist](http://energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Debunking-Gasland.pdf)). ([Monsanto Protection Act is another disturbing example](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elizabeth-kucinich/monsanto-protection-act_b_3921968.html))

Basically, Congress needs to pass a law making it illegal for propaganda to exist, and then by some miracle, they need to make headway in the lame talking point fueled media that panders to all these legislative/celebrity politicians.

Even on MSNBC, [with people who *agree on the same basic perspective and interpretation of the issue*](http://youtu.be/kiHkFKeKTok?t=4m42s), there is still mistrust about who ""is spreading propaganda"".

So, let's try and have a discussion about how viral this concept could go, and whether or not it's even considered sane or not.

**CLARIFICATION**
I've been getting some comments where people accuse me of trying to propose a law that states: ""This is propaganda. That is not propaganda. This is propaganda. This is not propaganda.. etc."" Nothing could be further from the truth. This proposal is merely for appropriating the same human resources that our judicial system would reserve for *any* trial where there are clearly witnesses needing to seek a verdict and judgement for a felony.

**This is basically just a law that would make it a felony to spread propaganda, contingent upon a trial where witnesses are called to investigate and debate whether or not something is and isn't a malicious lie spread by a major news organization or popular/powerful information source.**

**::SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION::**

1. fair, open, and sincere trial (no illogical 'debating', no hiding 'evidence' from the public, no shady shills gaining complete control over the investigation and prosecution)

2. to file an indictment on this type of felony (or misdemeanor), the crime has to be committed by what is technically an economic special interest (some type of company, preferably a wealthy one that is well connected to the economy in many controversial and powerful aspects)

3. the obvious lawsuits that come to mind would be something like ""Fox News vs MSNBC"". actually, i think it'd be impossible for Fox News to not receive the brunt of these types of charges being filed (i'm guessing). frivolous lawsuits can't be the emphasis, while major sources of propaganda and dissension get a free pass.

4. if a news organization wants to tell its audience that the trial banning it from saying something was done improperly, then they will be allowed to say this (because this type of argument cannot be considered propaganda until it gets a separate trial).

5. if a previous trial's legitimacy is reviewed in its own separate trial, efforts will be made to improve the education, replication, and broadening of that trial's appeal toward the masses. (this includes making the trial more believable to people who could have any kind of sensible grievance with the original trial)",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1mlg39/should_congress_realistically_achieve_bipartisan/,1379449752.0,1mlg39
propaganda,politicaldiscussion,"We don't just need more people voting, we need more people running for office!","America as it stands is proudly and completely complacent when it comes to real issues until something major happens. Even when something major happens, they tend to adapt to the problem instead of solving it. Because any attempt to solve the problem will have a people who benefit from it howling and screaming. They want history to repeat themselves for their own benefit.

To the average American populace, democracy is voting, then bitching and moaning about the people you elect, and listening to government -connected stenographers we call reporters and talking heads we call experts. Everything else is honey boo boo, sport, the dumb celebrity news of the week, or the criminal trial or disaster of the month. Anything that is not the economy, gun control, abortion, same-sex rights, or war-torn authoritarian country of the year does not get reported or at least marginalized or mocked because they’re not politically or economically privileged.
 
For the politically and economically privileged, politics is basically doing whatever with people with money ask you to. Politics is not to solve problems, but to let problems continue. If there is no problem, you create one. See a problem, let it fester or create a band-aid toward the problem. Seeking re-election, select a hot button issue and the contest devolves into a popularity contest of how much a person can say the same thing with money wins.

The ultimate goal of american political stricture is to turn people into passive consumers, rather than active citizens. Passive consumers are more susceptible to commercial advertising and political propaganda of corporate owned media and official government news. A real person can raise awareness all he wants, but people will reveal themselves to be produly willfully ignorant. About 80% of our populace do not care about the real issues: economic inequality, education, environment, housing, corruption, and others. However, the 20% will. They key is finding that 20%.

The 20% of the people who care, the 20% who actually care about america’s future. The people who experienced hardship first hand, the people who are the workers, farmers, blue collars, white collars, intellectuals, and economically privileged who are silent but are supportive of solving the real issues are the that 20% That will be the new vanguard. 

This new vanguard should politically educated, politically active, and people who will not be co-opted by any outside special interest for any reason.

For all intents and purposes we are on our own when it comes to real change. President Obama campaigned for hope and change to get people vote for him. When he got elected he slowly devolved into a house slave. It merely proved that waiting for a savior like Obama won’t help you. Each politician who we worship as saviors, come from the same political/class establishment of the economically privileged. The sad truth is that if you want to see real change, you have to make the real change yourself and don’t wait for a savior.

The only solution to this crisis is not just getting people to vote, but to get more people to run for office. We need people to actually run in any public office that is open to be contested. We need regular people to run for office, the not just the average citizen nor the professional politicians but the educated, politically active, life experienced citizen.

We live under a system of total propaganda, that the US is ""the best"" and ""they hate us for our freedoms."" We all know better than that here, I hope. But what if the US isn't just merely a kinda shitty place, but actually a truly evil nation?

fake news,politicaldiscussion,"GA Grand Jury issues indictments against Donald Trump et al for their efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Trump called it a witch hunt. Unlike federal courts, GA allows cameras in court usually. If televised, will that make it easier for public at large to accept the verdict?","Recently Trump was indicted in DC for the charges of election fraud and his attempt to overturn the election results; related to fake electors' schemes and other communication to pressure election officials to find ballots that did not exist, and which would turn his loss in a given state to a win. the DC evidence in the federal indictment include in substantive aspects of what occurred in Georgia \[among other states\].

The two set of charges are, however, distinct. One is based on violation of the federal code including conspiracy to overturn the election and the one in Georgia is based on state law violation including the expansive Georgia RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) and also includes conspiracy and forgery.  Far more expansive than the federal RICO statute.

State RICO lists over 3 dozens predicate crimes or acts under state and federal law that constitute ‘racketeering activity’ to trigger the statute’s application.” Racketeering activity means to commit, to attempt to commit, or to solicit, coerce, or intimidate another person to commit any crime which is chargeable by indictment under certain specified categories of laws.

Too, a president can pardon himself \[except impeachment\] and or be pardoned for a federal crime by another president but have no jurisdiction over state crimes.  Generally, the governor of state has the power to pardon over the state crimes and sometimes also may require approval from the legislature.

The Fulton County, Atlanta DA, Willis, launched her investigation into Trump in early 2021, soon after he called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and pressured the Republican to “find” the votes necessary for Trump to win the state.

The original special purpose grand jury had broad investigative powers, but no authority to issue indictments and only made recommendations; it was then reported by the foreperson they recommended as many as 12 indictments. The Regular Grand Jury \[second one\] directly heard from the subpoenaed witnesses and could either have approved or rejected the indictments, they approved the indictments.

The witnesses that were summoned to testify speak to various prongs of Willis’ investigation, from conspiracy-laden presentations that Trump’s associates – including former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani – made before Georgia lawmakers in 2020, to the convening of fake electors to try to thwart President Joe Biden’s victory in the state. She could have also relied on her internal investigators to present evidence that was previously collected by the special purpose grand jury.

Trump has always insisted his call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was a “perfect phone call.” \[Notwithstanding the fact that he told him to find 11,180 votes, which is one more than he needed.\] Trump has already pleaded not guilty to charges brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith \[in Florida relating to documents and DC related to election fraud\] Trump will certainly do the same.in the Willis case.

Our country remains deeply divided. With a significant portion of Trump supporters believing he did nothing wrong; while many Democrats believe he tried to overthrow the elections and retain power eventually resulting in the riots on January 6, 2021, at the Capitol, resulting in death and serious injuries to many officers as well as some violet rioters. Hundreds of rioters have since been convicted and many are imprisoned, and more are expected to go to trial.

As noted, GA allows cameras in court \[with some exceptions covering primarily juveniles.\] It is easier sometimes to accept the results of a jury verdict if they get to see the trial and determine for themselves if the verdict is just. GA may allow the trial to be televised \[like it did the indictment\] so citizens at large can judge for themselves.

If televised, will that make it easier for the public at large to accept the verdict?

fake news,politicaldiscussion,January 6th Hearings discussion thread - Part IV,"Here's a thread to discuss the fourth ""January 6th"" public hearing, which was held Tuesday, June 21st. You can [watch the hearings on C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?521075-1/fourth-hearing-investigation-capitol-attack), as well as plenty of other places.

[Today's hearing](https://www.c-span.org/video/?521075-1/fourth-hearing-investigation-capitol-attack) focused on the actions of Trump and his team when they pressured state officials to change or throw out state-level election results. In his opening statement, Mr. Thompson mentioned the recent case in New Mexico, where a [county commissioner has attempted](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/new-mexico-county-commissioner-who-refuses-to-certify-recent-election-results-sentenced-for-role-in-january-6-attack/ar-AAYAWwp) to throw out election results he disagreed with, as an example of the ongoing threat to democracy from the GOP. Ms. Cheney linked this plan to the other efforts to overthrow the election related to January 6th, and re-iterated that Trump was told by several campaign and administration officials that there was no basis for the claims of election fraud. Mr. Schiff continued by connecting the events they'll discuss in this hearing to the rest of the January 6th plot. Schiff described the pressure campaign, which continued for weeks, even after Trump was told by AG Barr and others than the claims of fraud were ""b\*llsh\*t"", and how Republicans targeted election officials and even election workers with doxxing and threats of violence. They showed video of Nick Fuentes implying that his supporters should kill state legislators. The four witnesses gave testimony about how this campaign worked from their point of view. Rusty Bowers, GOP speaker of the Arizona state house and Brad Raffensperger, GOP Secretary of State of Georgia, and Gabriel Sterling, COO of the state of Georgia, and Wandrea Shamoss, a former elections worker in Fulton County, GA.

Speaker Bowers testified about [Trump's statement of today](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-threatens-rusty-bowers-audio-tape-he-said-election-was-rigged-arizona-1717778) saying that Bowers told Trump in November 2020 that the election was rigged and Trump won AZ. Bowers testified that both of those statements are false. He spoke to Giuliani and Trump multiple times after the election. Bowers asked Giuliani for proof of the fraud in the form of names of illegal and dead voters, which Giuliani promised to give during the call, but never provided to Bowers. Trump asked Bowers to hold a committee meeting at the AZ capitol to review the evidence. Bowers referred to it as a ""circus"", and refused. Trump wanted the committee to remove Biden's electors and replace them with Trump electors. Bowers told Trump that this would be in violation of his oath of office. He described a fake AZ ""legislative hearing"" held by Giuliani and others in Phoenix. He said the fake hearing did not follow protocols, and was not a real legislative hearing. Jenna Ellis also told Bowers that she had the supposed list of illegal and dead voters, and would give it to him, but never did. No one ever provided evidence of significant election fraud to Bowers. They showed footage of armed protestors illegally entering and refusing to leave the AZ state house, including Jacob Chansley, the Q-anon shaman, as well as proud boys. They called for Bowers by name. Bowers testified that he supported and voted for Trump in 2020. Later, Eastman called Bowers in December and asked for the legislature to take a vote to decertify the GA electors. Eastman: ""Just do it and let the courts sort it out."" Bowers refused. Bowers testified that he ""would not do anything illegal for him"" twice. He got a call from US Rep. Biggs of AZ on the AM of Jan 6th. Biggs asked him to sign a letter and support the decertification of the electors. Bowers refused.

November 18th, Trump campaign lawyer Kenneth CheseBro wrote a memo describing a scheme to send slates of fake electors. Giuliani, Meadows, Eastman, several members of congress, and the RNC were involved in setting up this scheme. After the election fraud cases failed in court, several lawyers associated with the scheme became uncomfortable and refused to participate further. The white house counsels office said that this scheme was ""not legally sound."" Robert Sinners, Trump campaign staffer, described himself and others who helped with the scheme as ""Useful idiots"" or ""rubes"", and that ""no one really cared"" if they were ""putting themselves in jeopardy."" They were told that the fake electors would ""only be used"" if the campaign won in court. The schemers told the fake electors to meet in secret. Fake electors in 7 states met in December 14 2020, and signed documents falsely asserting that they were ""duly elected"" electors, and submitted them to the National Archives and VP Pence. Eastman said that the fact of the multiple slates of electors demonstrated the uncertainty of either. Pence did not consider these votes lawfully submitted, and did not consider them when he certified the results after the attack on the capitol.

Bowers testified that Trump supporters harassed and threatened his office with thousands of texts, voicemails, and emails. Trump supporters protested Bowers home, called Bowers a pedophile and pervert, and threatened him and his neighbors.

Trump on Jan 6, after Barr told him that these claims were false: ""They should find those votes. ....just over 11,000 votes, that's all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia."" Raffensperger: supported Trump in 2020. Election day went remarkably smooth in GA. Biden won by approximately 12,000 votes. Did an audit and hand recount of all 5 million ballot, came remarkably close to the first count. Trump asked for another recount, same results. Even after losing in court, Trump & co. continued to make many allegations of voter fraud. Spokesperson/COO Sterling Dec 1 press conference, asked Trump ""...Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed."" Why?: Dominion voting systems project manager told him their contractor was being threatened by Q-Anon. Tweet, directed at contractor: ""You've committed treason, may God have mercy on your soul"" with a noose gif. Trump tweeted response: ""Massive voter fraud in GA."" (False). Dec 2 Trump video: ""...thousands and thousands of votes that were out of whack..."". Giuliani launched conspiracy theory: election workers kicked out poll observers, [suitcases of ballots](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/video-doesnt-show-suitcases-of-illegal-ballots-in-georgia/) in Fulton County. This was false, and promoted by Trump and Giuliani. Sterling's office reviewed 48 hours of video, showed normal ballot processing. ""Suitcases"" were sealed ballot carriers. Workers were started to quit for the night, Raffensperger asked supervisor to keep on counting, so they stored the ballots, then re-opened the boxes. Hand tally: 0.1053% off of total votes, 0.0099% off of margin, ""basically dead-on accurate"". Sterling gave frequent press briefings to address disinformation. Trump team continued to promote conspiracy theories even after they were disproved. Trump supporter, after Sterling personally disproved the allegations of fraud to him: ""I just know in my heart they cheated.""

US Atty Pack looked into the allegations for AG Barr, and told Barr that ""Giuliani was wrong"". Barr said ""Fulton county allegations had no merit."" Dep. AG Donahue told Trump directly that allegations ""had been thoroughly investigated and were without merit.""

Trump to GA investigator Watson, Chief investigator, a state law enforcement official, Dec 24th: ""I won by hundreds of thousands of votes."" ""When the right answer comes out, you'll be praised."" ""Whatever you can do."" Meadows wanted to send Watson's office ""A shitload of POTUS stuff. Signed hats."" wtf? :/

Jan 2nd, phone call from Trump to Raffensperger. ""Nothing wrong with saying that you've recalculated."" The numbers are the numbers. He checked each of the allegations, 300 investigations and none of them turned up significant results that could come close to changing the results. FBI and GBI also looked into allegations, found nothing. Trump: ""They're either dishonest or incompetent."" Trump retweeted ""...\[Governor Kemp\] and \[Raffensperger\] ... going to jail."" Trump: ""Ballots are corrupt. \[...\] You know what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal offense..."" ... ""...I just wanna find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state."" Trump: ""...criminality...that's very dangerous."" Raffesperger: I thought this was a threat. Cellphone & wife's were doxxed. His wife received sexualized attacks over text. People broke into daughter-in-law's home. Raffensperger: ""We followed the law and we followed the Constitution.""

Trump: ""Why wouldn't you want to find the right answers...we just want the truth. Everyone's gonna look very good when the truth comes out. I won by 400,000 votes. I only need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.""

Wandrea Shaye Moss and her mother, targeted by Trump & the GOP. Election worker for over 10 years. She looked frightened. Talked about how she loved her job. She & her mother were on the ""suitcase plot"" videos promoted by Trump & Co. Giuliani on video, accused Wandrea and her mother by name of: ""...passing around USB ports as if they're vials of heroin or cocaine."" (Me: Talk about racist dog whistles...). Received facebook threats. Death. Jail with her mother. Be glad its not 1920. Racist comments. Trump repeated the false allegations in call to Raffensperger, named Ruby Freeman (Moss's mother) a ""professional vote scammer and hustler"". Trump attacked them 18 times on the call. Ruby Moss is afraid to give her name in public now. Wandrea is afraid to go anywhere. FBI told Ruby that she had to leave her house for her safety for two months around/after January 6th. Prompted by January 6th, she had gotten many threats. Trump supporters showed up at Wandrea's grandmother's house. Pushed their way in ""to make a citizens arrest"" looking for Wandrea and Rose. Some people made fake pizza deliveries. None of the election workers shown in the ""suitcase"" video are still working there, including Wandrea and her mother. Other election workers around the country have been subjected to lies and threats. Rose: ""Do you know how it feels to have the President of the United States target you?""

Note: Most of my quotes are ""best effort"" and probably not 100% accurate.

Once again, super long. I'm a bit tired and don't feel like editing it down further, so **tldr**: Trump & company pressured state election officials to overturn their states' results in 2020. Trump & his allies lied and made up conspiracy theories to promote the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Based on these lies, Trump supporters harassed and threatened election officials and volunteers. Trump & Co promoted and supported these lies after they had been disproved. When state election officials did not comply with the scheme to overturn the election, the Trump campaign created fake slates of electors, and submitted fake votes to the National Archives and congress/VP Pence. VP Pence did not consider these votes legitimate and ignored them. 

\- Is it reasonable that someone in Trump's position would still believe the allegations of fraud, despite being told my so many people that they were false?

\- Will the GOP attempt to spoil or overturn election results in 2022 and 2024? Will they succeed?

\- What are your plans for living in a post-democracy America?

\- Do you think incidents such as what happen to Ms. Moss and her mother will discourage Americans from being election workers?",233,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/vhoj1g/january_6th_hearings_discussion_thread_part_iv/,1655848051.0,vhoj1g
fake news,politicaldiscussion,"Trump has been under scrutiny for his response to COVID-19 and his doubt in scientific guidelines. What effect will Bob Woodward's book 'Rage', featuring interviews with Trump downplaying COVID-19, have on his approval rating, support among his base, and legacy as a president in a time of crisis?","[Washington Post: 'Woodward book: Trump says he knew coronavirus was ‘deadly’ and worse than the flu while intentionally misleading Americans'.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump/2020/09/09/0368fe3c-efd2-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html) The article provides audio recordings of the numerous comments Trump made downplaying the virus back in Spring and also shares his comments on race relations and diplomacy with Kim Jong Un. Additionally, the article reports that Woodward's new book *Rage* features accounts on Trump's fitness for office from Jim Mattis and others who have left the Trump administration.

An interesting point to these revelations is that they have all been recorded, with Trump's permission, so the excuse of fake news or unreliable sources is impossible to use this time, like his administration did with his alleged comments on dead soldiers last week. Additionally, Republican senators and officials I've seen asked to comment on this matter, like [Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9E-dGkE-jI), appear to struggle articulating a logical defense for the president, most not attempting to directly grapple with what he said. 

But Trump's core supporters have proven resolute with their support for him. Will this negatively affect support among his base? How might Republican senators and Republican leaning reporters and anchors explain these new developments in a way which does not implicate the president with irresponsibility or deceit in handling this pandemic? Might this, along with the full release of Woodward's book, lead to a dip in election polls for Trump?

Lastly, how will this development add to Trump's legacy as a leader during a time of great crisis?",813,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ipvrdh/trump_has_been_under_scrutiny_for_his_response_to/,1599709149.0,ipvrdh

Eliminates all funding for PBS, NPR

A 25% budget cut to the EPA

Will red voters care that this adds $4.4 trillion to our deficit?  (Actually $7 trillion, my mistake) Or will they just say it's fake news? Will this energize blue voters in red states because of entitlement and EPA cuts?

fake news,politicaldiscussion,What Makes a News Source Credible and Trustworthy?,"In recent years, considerable attention has been brought to the rise of ""fake news"" and other forms of misinformation within the media. Similarly, recent polls have noted an erosion of confidence in the honesty of the press amongst the American public. 

http://www.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx

Needless to say, a well-informed general population with trust in the reliability of public information is an important part of a healthy democratic society. However, it is seldom explained what exactly constitutes a ""reliable"" source of news. Specifically, what distinguishes a trustworthy news source from one that is not? Stated another way, what makes established, ""mainstream,"" News outlets like CNN, the BBC, The Economist, the New York and Financial Times so much more deserving of trust than ""alternative"" outlets? 

Furthermore, what specific methods can be used to distinguish sources that are credible from those that are not? How would you communicate this process to a layperson and/or those who already receive misinformation from, and have trust in, deceptive news sources?

fake news,politicaldiscussion,What Are Your Opinions on Syria?,"I know there have been a few posts already, but I wanted to put my two cents out there. I posted this on facebook earlier today.

So Syria is in the news again, and we're expected to launch a punitive strike that equates to nothing more than a political slap on the wrist for Assad (granted, this is speculation right now). Chris Hamer, the analyst who mentioned that limited cruise missiles were a low cost option, has said that he believes the surgical strikes lack strategic objectives (military force without a strategic end game is foolhardy, just look at Afghanistan). The forecast for these strikes seem grim. A lot of people think that they're unnecessarily getting America involved with another country, while others think that it isn't enough. In my opinion, one of three things will happen.

First, the situation in Syria will not change significantly. Assad has stabilized and even begun to push back rebels in certain parts of the country without the aid of chemical weapons. So he could feasibly keep on rolling if we don't hit key military installations (i.e. airbases). 

Second, Assad might somewhat benefit from the strikes. Not only did Assad defy the United States, he also survived a direct military action from the world's most powerful Navy. That demoralizes the rebels, and increases his street credibility. It's like my father tells me, ""Even if you walk away from a fight with a bloody nose, people will respect that you stood up to the tougher man.""

Third, Assad believes that this is the beginning of a wider American intervention. The strike puts fear into the heart of Assad, and he adopts a ""use em or lose em"" mentality that results in him deploying more chemical weapons.

There are other possible results, like some form of retaliation against Israel. Iran and Syria have both been harping that they will attack Israel in response to American aggression. I doubt that will occur, because that hardly advances either nations' regional interest. Absolutely, the Russians and Chinese will retaliate against us politically, which is a mess in and of itself.

If we are going to strike, it ought to be in a form that advances what interests we do have in the country. Like, hitting al-Nursa hubs in the country. But cruise missiles seem like an overpriced way to do that, especially since they are logistically based out of Iraq anyways. So I don't really know how TLAMs would be used to undermine terrorist influence in the country...

Maybe this is an elaborate fake out, and contrary to the belief of analysts, Obama intends on conducting a shock and awe style campaign that decimates the pillars of Assad's power. Who knows. But based on what I'm reading right now, that doesn't seem to be the case...",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1lbi0g/what_are_your_opinions_on_syria/,1377764946.0,1lbi0g
fake news,politicaldiscussion,"Out of your comfort-zones, and into the streets, Americans. You owe it not just to yourselves, but the entire world.","*I originally posted this topic at /r/ChangeMyView to give it some sort of [basic vetting process](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ftsg8/i_thinki_believe_the_only_meaningful_resolution/) before opening it up to a larger discussion, but seeing as how few responses have been forthcoming, I have figured it would be worthwhile to start placing my writing elsewhere.*

Grab a beer, pack a bowl, and break out the Ramen, this is going to be a long one. There will be no TL;DR. I will not cheapen my thoughts that I feel strongly about --but am willing to reconsider-- by trying to sum them up in a way that fails to adequately communicate my position.

We have all seen it by now, but it is evident that the United States government has obtained all of the qualities of a [police state](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order). Citizens are executed without [due process](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/22/american-citizens-drone-strikes_n_3321950.html). In order to give you a sense of just how long the list actually is, I encourage you to check out this one redditor's [handiwork](http://www.reddit.com/r/yrugay/comments/1d2qq0/archive/) detailing only the surface of the problems faced by American society as a result of institutional designs to manipulate and surveil the wider captive public.

It is not hyperbole to say our police state has developed beyond both the Nazi and Soviet experiments with secretly monitoring citizens. This is the point where Americans need to snap out of their battered-wife syndrome reflex of defending the gross oversteps of the government after they have been exposed and realize ""oh shit, it really is that bad"". This is the point where Americans need to realize that a week in the streets is a small price to pay for living in a world where regular folks aren't targeted by broad government dragnets digging up and keeping every detail about your life.

When this is coupled with the obvious [two-tiered justice system](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/12/hsbc-prosecution-fine-money-laundering), we can see that regular folks are being reduced to what could probably be described best as contract serfdom. Cynics will invariably claim that this ""simply is the way it is"", and that ""no effort could ever overturn it"". Americans are ""lazy"", ""stupid"", and generally on the shallower end of the gene pool; of course, this is nonsense. True, Americans are kept in a blissful state of unawareness, but this blissful state is often rocked by the realities of hardship that seem to be raising their head with greater frequency. If anything, the claim of American Ignorance is a projection of the cynics own inability to even *imagine* the possibility of an alternative to the existing arrangement.

When we look in our own communities, we can see that unemployment continues to devastate most of us, and we even are approaching points where destroying sustainable means of feeding oneself are being [actively targeted](http://www.activistpost.com/2012/11/fl-man-refuses-city-order-to-destroy.html). 

All of this, following a president who was popularly elected on platforms of [transparency and openness](http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9845595-7.html) that has turned out to be a [legitimate threat](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/opinion/president-obamas-dragnet.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) to our civil liberties (and we can thank his Republican collaborator-predecessor for setting the precedent). A president who has from the beginning sold us lies and half-truths. This isn't a Democrat thing. This isn't a Republican thing. This is a Plutocrat thing. This is a group of people who are in all **virtually unaccountable in any meaningful sense**, making decisions which directly impact us all, and hardly for the better.

So what do I propose? Shut down everything. Turn off your computers (unless absolutely vital), turn off your cell phones (unless absolutely vital), turn off your televisions (and put them on the curb). For how long? As long as it takes. A day. A week. A month. However long it takes for every single person in a position of executive power to leave that position. If we took a step for each phone call we made that was caught in the dragnet, we would have marched our way all the way to DC, if not the political centers closest to us.

At this point, we have nothing to lose but a [false sense of comfort](https://www.google.com/search?q=police+raid+wrong+house&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) and a bleak outlook for the vast majority of the [American population into the foreseeable future](http://gawker.com/5958230/no-matter-whos-president-you-will-never-be-able-to-retire). The very fact that [CISPA](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/04/25/aclu-cispa-is-dead-for-now) has raised its ugly head *twice* in two years suggests that this isn't simply the result of well-intentioned people trying to create a framework of balanced safety and liberty and having those good intentions paving the road to hell, but a deliberate attempt to monitor and observe the American population on a scale greater than already exists. **It can only get worse.**

How should it play out? I don't have every answer, but I have imagined something that simultaneously creates alternative methods of governance and works with part of the existing framework of the government that still has desirability.

**The Revolt**

First, students stage sit ins, walk outs, and teach ins. School has already ended in parts of the country, but in others it still goes on into the month. Truthfully, it is they who will bear the brunt of the existing world if we fail. They have the most stake in the world (they'll be here longer than most of us, generally speaking). People should go into work intermittently, and arrange with their neighbors to find alternatives to the services they would normally go elsewhere to seek. This might include everything from creating a mutual credit system (allowing the community to buy and sell goods by putting up their own effort/work/goods as collateral) to organizing barter-pools to creating neighborhood watches.

The point should be to abstain from as much ""mainstream"" government and business as we can possibly manage; it isn't always possible in every circumstance, but the focus should be to create the structures which will exist *alongside* the government for the duration of the revolt that operate in more democratic fashions. By empowering each other, we can easily create sustainable and accountable alternatives (if I might in indulge in fantasy, it would be wonderful to see most government services turned into producer and social cooperatives). 

March on each politicians home and office, and demand their resignation. By pressuring each one out, it would prompt special elections that would lead into the next step.

When the government cracks down, we lash out. Avoid destroying shit if we can, but no revolt is perfect and we should be prepared to defend ourselves, and should not fear or look poorly on the destruction of property if it means saving people from serious harm (I'm looking at you, police tanks). It is time to accept that the police as an institution have made their decision when it comes to protecting the interests of those in and closest to the government. They have accepted a paycheck and put aside their considerations about community, and have literally sold out their interests to the government. One can easily be in favor of an orderly society and still opposed the governments acts. The two are not exclusive, and police officers *do* have a choice.

**The Sortition**

While the government struggles to deal with the Revolt, we will carry out the Great American Sortition. Anyone can sign up, filling out their information and recording a YouTube video to get a sense of what they were like (emphasizing honesty; everyone has skeletons, don't be afraid to share yours if you think its going to be a big deal later on). Assuming each participant passes basic screening measures (not a fake, literate, generally competent, preferably someone who isn't involved with a major corporation, political party, or high up in a government bureaucracy). They will renounce any political allegiances and if registered to vote, become independents.

After the sign up closes, everyone will be placed into a ""hat"", and names will be drawn along the lines of a predetermined number and order based on the estimations of the participant to fundamentally shift control of political power to the Sortition participants. Before the names are drawn however, the Sortition will select one major political goal that will be the main focus of the group pulled from the ""hat"". Those pulled from the ""hat"" will then be tasked with completing that political goal by creating a small-crowd funded campaign. The campaign doesn't need to be massive in scope, just big enough to provide visibility about the project and allow it to run without having to turn to corporate or political sources.

To sum it up, it would be a Reddit Political Hug, overloading the system with votes for the selected sortition candidates.

**The Aftermath**

Whichever cause selected is likely to be one that would go a long way towards impacting most people. We might do a debt amnesty (we *should* do a debt amnesty). We might end the War on Drugs and pardon all non-violent drug offenders. We might grant total amnesty to all migrants living in the United States territories (we *should* give them residence amnesty). We might give privilege of office to people younger (there is no reason we couldn't or shouldn't). Hopefully, this Reddit Political Hug will have sent the two dominant parties into a tailspin, allowing for the rise of popular parties or even a complete shift away from parties and consensus decision making.


So, there it is. Out of your homes, out of your offices, out of your schools and into this street. This Monday should be **our** Monday. I mean, has it ever seemed strange to anyone that American culture -- for all its talk of democracy being a core component to the American character -- **never once developed a cultural day of the week where we could take our time to focus on our most important concerns in our community** ? Think about it for a moment: we take a cultural day of worship for granted, but *never once* consider the possibility of a day where we can directly participate in the organization and running of our communities in a country that widely claims to be a secular democracy!

Leaving our future up to people who are so removed from our concerns turns the social contract into a suicide pact. We need to re-shift our focus back to our communities and remember that liberty and safety can be had if we learn to work with each other. In fact, most external threats to our safety only exist as a direct result of the governments [foreign policy](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/04/yemen-drones-muslimi/). If we don't owe it to ourselves, we at least owe to everyone else in the world to gum up the machine that is slowly driving them into oblivion.

So... can anyone tell me why we should continue on our current trajectory and not do something radical to save ourselves and our kids? What is there to lose? The next sweetheart of the Mainstream Political World will offer us nothing different, so why continue doing something we have proven simply won't work? The only thing that really can stop this from succeeding is saying ""I'd rather continue to live under this system, and let it play out despite the fact that its destroying the fabric of society"".

fake news,politicaldiscussion,the absurdity of conspiracy theories,"Why do people believe in conspiracy theories?  Scientific American recently summarized studies indicating that conspiracy theorists fail to think with logical consistency, instead tending to hold contradictory ideas simultaneously.  Some psychologists have gone further, suggesting conspiracy theorists are paranoid, schizophrenic, etc.

My intention here is to outline the general pattern of a conspiracy theory, give an illustrative example, and expose the common fallacies involved.  I think we can agree that a conspiracy theory has three common characteristics:  (1) *Multiple people in positions of power collaborating with an intent to deceive.*  Often the paranoids imagine these players to be so highly placed, up to and including the US President, the UK Prime Minister, etc., it is ludicrous.  The machinations of these nefarious leaders frequently involve the wholesale slaughter of thousands of innocent human lives.  As wikipedia summarizes, a ""conspiracy theory"" is ""a secret plot by exceptionally powerful and cunning conspirators to achieve a malevolent end"".  (2)  *Many confederates who are complicit with the conspiracy, or at least play the role of useful idiots.*  Often the sheer number of these players, typically in the government and the mass media, is implausible to the extreme.  It is of course not in human nature to simply go along with leaders without question or morality.
(3)  *A populace evidently too dense to see through any of the above.*

By way of example, it is roughly the tenth anniversary of a conspiracy theory that, I am dismayed to report, still has many adherents.   I am referring to the theory that a cabal within the US government misled its own citizenry and the rest of the world in regards to the threat posed by Iraq, particularly Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, for the purpose of instigating an unjust war.  It is not hard to see how this paranoid fantasy fits the pattern outlined above.

Regarding the intent to deceive, as a general rule we should always first consider Hanlon's Razor: never attribute to malice that which one might conceivably attempt to explain with stupidity.  This is of course not a mere suggestion, but an actual axiom of life.  However, it does not apply in our particular case, for not only is malice out of the question, of course, but stupidity can also be ruled out.

The decision to go to war is, after all, the most important decision a nation can make.  In order to double check its justification for war, the Bush administration formed the Office of Special Plans, the sincerity of which is now legendary.  They also consulted Iraqi informants who were, already at that time, well-known for their truthfulness -- internationally renowned, in fact -- men such as Ahmed Chalabi and Khidir Hamza.  Do not impugn these men of integrity!

And the Bush administration also consulted with the CIA, to make sure they were on the right track.  Now the conspiracy theorists have alleged that, rather than being consulted, the CIA was instead being pressured to come to a foregone conclusion.  But if that were truly the case, then why didn't CIA analysts leak complaints about this state of affairs to the press on, say, March 23, 2003?

The Bush administration then helpfully passed on their valuable intelligence to UN weapons inspector Hans Blix.  Now, again, if they didn't have valid intelligence to offer on Iraqi WMD, but instead were merely pressuring Blix to follow their agenda, why didn't Blix ever complain about this situation?  

The tinfoil hat crowd goes even further, and alleges that the key piece of evidence the US had for Iraq's nuclear weapon program was in fact fake.  That was the contention of former diplomat Joseph Wilson, after looking into the matter.  But of course we know Wilson was motivated purely by partisan politics.  If the evidence that Iraq procured weapons-grade uranium from Niger was really so questionable, the CIA would have warned Bush prior to his State of the Union Address referencing this evidence on January 28, 2003.  Given this hypothesized warning, then, the implication is that Bush lied -- an unprecedented act of any sitting US president of course.  The gall of these truthers knows no bounds. 

If the Niger document was really a forgery, it would have been publicly exposed as such by the International Atomic Energy Agency, with a report to that effect made accessible on www.un.org by, say, March 7, 2003.  And of course, if that had actually happened, the press would have a field day, and the US government would have immediately halted its buildup to war to investigate and re-assess its evidence.  From the fact that this did not occur, we can of course infer that the document must be authentic.  But conspiracy theorists are not logical like you or me.

The conspiracy theorists instead maintain that the US government and the press  largely ignored the ""fact"" that the Niger document was a forgery.  But think of the sheer number of people who would have to go along with this!  It's preposterous of course.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.  If Iraq really had no WMD capability, this would have been known by the former chief UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter, who operated on the ground in Iraq through the late 1990's.  Why, then, didn't Ritter alert the media and demand an audience with senators?  Or perhaps he did, but was marginalized?  You see, paranoids can always come up with rationalizations to maintain their delusions.

Even worse, the mainstream news media is accused by the paranoids not just of selective reporting, but of actively reporting misleading stories on Iraqi WMD.  But surely if the disconnect between the press and reality became so obviously extreme, papers like the New York Times and the Washington Post would eventually be forced to issue public apologies just to maintain some appearance of journalistic integrity?  

Finally, for such a hypothetical conspiracy to be successful, the average citizen would have to be too dumb to catch on (for at least long enough to support the war effort).  Now, in the alternate reality of the conspiracy theorist, former weapons inspector Scott Ritter tried to inform the public of the absence of WMD in Iraq, not to mention that the IAEA publicly exposed the evidence for Iraq's nuclear weapons program as fraudulent, and meanwhile no tangible evidence for Iraqi WMD was found.  Yet, according to national polls conducted by Gallup, Pew, and other organizations just before and well after the war began, the majority of the US population believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.  (Similarly, a majority of the astute American population believed that Iraq had ties to the 9/11 attacks, and that war with Iraq was justified.)  Why, that would  imply that the majority of Americans do not exercise critical thinking!  It's a dark and twisted world inhabited by the conspiracy theorist.  I wouldn't want to live there.  Would you?  (Conspiracy nuts, on the other hand, are mainly motivated by the satisfaction of believing themselves to be smarter than others, according to expert Michael Barkun, Ph.D.)

tl;dr:  Men do not conspire behind closed doors.  Weapons of mass destruction will be found in Iraq.  To believe otherwise is madness.

fake news,politicaldiscussion,The GOP Universe compared to the WWE Universe,"The problem with the GOP and essentially the media (Fox News), the conservative politicians, and the extremely wealthy is that they've created a ""Universe"" that isn't actually based in reality. By doing this they've sucked in a particular part of the population. Through fear mongering, religious idealism, and oppression, everything that they've created their party on isn't real... it's a world that doesn't actually exist. They create their own rules, slogans, taglines... their own rhetoric. The common person who understands these rules, slogans, etc are engaged so much with this ""Universe"" that they fail to see how fake and ridiculous it all is.

It's funny, the WWE does the exact same thing. They've created a ""Universe"" that doesn't follow the rules of the ""real world."" If the WWE says ""that's part of the WWE Universe"" then, as the audience, you accept that as part of the show. 

The WWE has created a championship. The GOP has created ""the American Dream."" Neither are real, but you bet your ass the audience of both want to win it. The WWE has created ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys."" The GOP has their own.... ""Republicans"", and ""Democrats."" Fighting for everything that's good, while conquering over all ""evil."" Both ""Universes"" use their storytelling to manipulate your emotions so they can think for you. They tell you who to cheer, and who to boo. What is right, and what is wrong. Who cares if it's real... if your'e watching, listening, reading or thinking about it, you're playing by their rules.  

I guess the big problem is that one claims ""Entertainment"" and wants you suspend disbelief so you'll watch.

fake news,politicaldiscussion,Reviewing all of the current reported facts around the YouTube trailer that incited the Libyan embassy incident. Something seems to be very suspicious here.,"I've been reading every article I can find about this incident and trying to piece together the facts. Based on what I've been reading, I'm strongly starting to suspect that this YouTube film itself was part of a larger incitement plan. I'm not sure to what extent and how it might be connected but there are some startling questions raised.

Here are the key reported facts about the film itself:

* The cast and crew stated that a man going by the alias ""Bacile"" and claiming to be an Israeli Jew told them they were making a historical drama. The director is at the time claimed in [the Craiglist casting post](http://www.mooncasting.com/us/casting-feature-desert-warrior-los-angeles/) to be someone named ""Alan Roberts.""


* The crew and cast stated [the involvement of several middle eastern men in the initial production:](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1255908--does-sam-bacile-really-exist-innocence-of-muslims-director-could-be-coptic-christian-with-a-checkered-past)
>Klein said he didn’t know the real name of the man he called “Sam,” who came to him for advice on First Amendment issues. About 15 key players from the Middle East — people from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan and Iran, and a couple of Coptic Christians from Egypt — worked on the film, Klein said.


* Despite their involvement, the cast is selected to be largely white Americans without any particular formal acting training appearing in brown face make up.


* The actors are given alternate fake scripts that feature scenes that would visually match the inflammatory sequences but carefully packaged to completely conceal the film's content. Every effort is made by the 'producers' to hide, deceive, and trick the cast and crew from the actual intent and plan of what is actually being created. After several scenes are recorded with these actors, [the scenes are manipulated and re-dubbed to recast it into a blatant anti-Islamic caricature mocking the prophet Mohammed](http://gawker.com/5942748). 


* These scenes are cobbled together into a 14 minute YouTube video, but it is unclear at this time if an actual full film really exists or the entire effort was to manufacture the short YouTube clip. [There are now major doubts whether it was ever intended to be an actual film or some kind of larger hoax.](http://theweek.com/article/index/233263/does-the-movie-that-provoked-the-libyan-slayings-even-exist) Further doubts are cast when [claims that it was once screened in Hollywood fail to check out.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/world/middleeast/origins-of-provocative-video-shrouded.html?_r=3&hp&pagewanted=all)
>He said the film had been shown at a screening at a theater “100 yards or so” from Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood over the summer, drawing what he suggested was a depressingly small audience. He declined to specify what theater might have shown it, and theater owners in the vicinity of the busy strip said they had no record of any such showing.


* When news begins to break and reporters attempt to contact someone named ""Bacile,"" [the man via phone impersonating him tells any reporter who will listen that the movie was created at the behest of ""100 Israeli Jews"" who gave him ""5 million dollars.""](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/09/12/161003427/what-we-know-about-sam-bacile-the-man-behind-the-muhammad-movie)  No evidence of any kind supporting this claim has been found.


* The man impersonating Bacile is revealed to be Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, an Egyptian man living in California. He pleaded no contest in 2010 to federal bank fraud charges and served 21 months in federal prison. [He has been operating under several pseudonyms. Federal court papers show Mr Nakoula’s aliases include Nicola Bacily, Erwin Salameh and others.] (http://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/jewish-director-of-prophet-muhammed-film-sam-bacile-may-be-alias-of-egyptian-fraud-convict-8134746.html)


* When confronted by an AP reporter he continues to claim that Bacile is a real person who is a Jewish Israeli and further claims that he himself is a Coptic Christian.
>""Nakoula denied he had posed as Bacile. During a conversation outside his home, he offered his driver's license to show his identity but kept his thumb over his middle name, Basseley. Records checks by the AP subsequently found the name 'Basseley' and other connections to the Bacile persona.


* Two key players in this drama, Terry Jones and Sam Klein say that they were contacted by this man under his alias and asked to distribute and promote this film. Both are known for anti-Muslim rhetoric and Jones himself is known for inciting violence through past incidents. This is what helped create the massive confusion about whether the film was created by Coptics or Terry Jones or whoever. It now appears clear that all of those people were brought in after the creation of the video, spoke only briefly with Bacile, and were told to promote the video at a certain time. [They also appear to have been misled about the identity of the real creators:](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/muhammad-film-consultant-sam-bacile-is-not-israeli-and-not-a-real-name/262290/)
>Klein told me that Bacile, the producer of the film, is not Israeli, and most likely not Jewish, as has been reported, and that the name is, in fact, a pseudonym. He said he did not know “Bacile”‘s real name. He said the man who identified himself as Bacile asked him to help make the anti-Muhammad film. When I asked him to describe Bacile, he said: “**I don’t know that much about him. I met him, I spoke to him for an hour.** He’s not Israeli, no. I can tell you this for sure, the State of Israel is not involved, Terry Jones (the radical Christian Quran-burning pastor) is not involved. **His name is a pseudonym. All these Middle Eastern folks I work with have pseudonyms. I doubt he’s Jewish. I would suspect this is a disinformation campaign.**”


* Both men are asked to promote the YouTube video around the date of the attacks, 9/11. Though the video has been online for months at this point, and completely ignored. [Terry Jones, publicly known for inciting violence is brought in at this point:](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h0mrl3Q2GBDz-IB8AR9YyByWKqPw?docId=80b06a6ab90443feb4d91aefb6674cc6)
>Pastor Terry Jones of Gainesville, Fla., who burned Qurans on the ninth anniversary of 9/11, said he spoke with the movie's director on the phone Wednesday and prayed for him. He said he has not met the filmmaker in person, but the man contacted him a few weeks ago about promoting the movie. ""I have not met him. Sam Bacile, that is not his real name,"" Jones said. ""I just talked to him on the phone.


* Reports from eyewitnesses and officials come in from Libya that the deadly attack on the US embassy appears to have been pre-planned. It's said that the attackers appeared extremely professional level and that the protest outside appeared relatively peaceful and largely used as [a diversion until the actual attack began.](http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-us-ambassador-killed/index.html?hpt=hp_t1)
>But U.S. sources said Wednesday the four-hour assault in Benghazi had been planned, with the attackers using the protest as a diversion.

>Captain Fathi al-Obeidi, commander of a special Libyan operations unit, said his men and an eight-man U.S. force came under attack after American survivors had left the blazing consulate and moved to an ostensibly secret location in an isolated villa. The villa came under an intense and highly accurate mortar barrage.
“I really believe that this attack was planned,” he said. “The accuracy with which the mortars hit us was too good for any regular revolutionaries.”


* Some analysts are suggest the violence stemming from the video clip was far from spontaneous. [Nasser Weddady, civil rights outreach director for the American Islamic Congress gives this statement to the press:](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2012/0912/Libya-attack-Who-s-behind-the-inflammatory-YouTube-video)
>“*This has all the earmarks of being heavily orchestrated.* There are extremist groups, funded by among others, the Saudis, who deliberately set out to inflame these kinds of extremist sentiments. The fact that the trailer sat unnoticed on YouTube for nearly two months, until the eleventh anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States. *Then it hit this very sophisticated network of media channels that spew this kind of hate. This did not just happen.”*


*  US officials continue to [investigate the attack.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/13/us-usa-libya-attack-idUSBRE88B1C620120913)
>""It bears the hallmarks of an organized attack"" and appeared to be preplanned, one U.S. official said.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 5 PM EST:**
 
* [Wired has uncovered information that the listed shell company that managed the film was named ""Pharaoh Voice, Inc""](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/anti-islam-flick/all/) and run by someone named ""Youssef M Basseley"" likely another alias of Nakoula. 
>L.A.-based actress Cindy Garcia, who played a role as the mother in the video, listed a “Sam Bassiel” as the film’s producer on her resume. Crew member Jimmy Israel was given the name “Abnob Nakoula Basseley” for registration with the Screen Actors Guild. A company behind the casting, called Pharaoh Voice, Inc., listed a “Youssef M. Basseley” as its president.  
[Corporate listing here.](http://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Hawaiian-Gardens/pharaoh-voice-inc/44853277.aspx)

* Nakoula nows denies any involvement in the film's creation stating:
>Nakoula told the Associated Press he managed a company that produced the video, but has since denied any involvement in the film. “I’m a gas station worker, I didn’t work on it, I know nothing about it. They need to blame someone,” Nakoula later told the Telegraph during an interview outside his Los Angeles home. But on Thursday, federal law enforcement officials said that Nakoula was in fact Bacile. 

* In July of 2011 — the month after he got out of jail — Nakoula started casting actors for “Innocence.”

* [WIRED article cites](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/anti-islam-flick/all/) several other aliases uncovered being used by Nakoula. Matthew Nekola; Ahmed Hamdy; Amal Nada; Daniel K. Caresman; Kritbag Difrat; Sobhi Bushra; Robert Bacily; Nicola Bacily; Thomas J. Tanas; Erwin Salameh; Mark Basseley Youssef; Yousseff M. Basseley; Malid Ahlawi; even P.J. Tobacco.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 6 PM EST**

* We now know somewhat of the process on how the video was spread in the key regions. [Both the U.S. promotion by Jones at the request of Bacile and the promoting within the middle east and Egypt specifically appeared to happen at the same time.](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/09/egyptian-outrage-peddler-who-sent-anti-islam-youtube-clip-viral/56826/)
> The original trailer of Innocence of Muslims was posted to YouTube by Bacile in July, but **never gained attention until last week when it was translated into Arabic and linked to by an Egyptian-American Copt Morris Sadek in an Arabic-language blog post. Around that same time, Koran-burning Florida Pastor Terry Jones began promoting the film to practically no effect in the U.S.** But it did gain the attention of a Glenn Beck-style TV pundit in Egypt: Sheikh Khalad Abdalla, a host on the Islamist satellite-TV station al-Nas.* On Sept. 8, Abdullah lit the match that set this entire international incident in motion and broadcast an offensive clip of the trailer in which a man playing Muhammad calls a donkey ""the first Muslim animal."" 
[Here's the fateful moment of Abdullah on TV playing the clip.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnM_NuW0r9M&feature=player_embedded)


* 3 days BEFORE the embassy attack and before the Bacile/Nousak interview with AP in which he claimed to be Coptic, the story that the video was created by ""Coptics"" was already circulating the middle east.
> Shortly following Abdullah's broadcast, views of the video began increasing rapidly and Cairo news outlet Youm7.com reported that the leader of an Egyptian political party ""denounced the production of the film with the participation of vengeful Copts.""

* Bacile/Nakoula's YouTube account appears to have favorited a video from Egyptian Salafist Al Nour Party featuring Al Nour Party spokesman Nader Bakkar:
> Sam Bacile, didn’t do much with his YouTube account, besides uploading two clips from the “Innocence of Muslims” film, but he also commented in Arabic on an Egyptian video discussing his movie, and [last month he had favorited a video from the Egyptian Salafist Al Nour Party featuring Al Nour Party spokesman Nader Bakkar attacking Ibrahim Issa and defending the Salafis](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DjVszAn4GAyzgsjtkJONg/videos?flow=grid&view=15). A video defending Salafism is an odd choice for someone who claims to think Islam is a cancer to add to his favorites.

**UPDATED INFORMATION 7 PM EST**

* [Nakoula himself has a more extensive criminal record than originally known:](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/13/mohammed-movie-s-mystery-director.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=cheatsheet_afternoon&cid=newsletter%3Bemail%3Bcheatsheet_afternoon&utm_term=Cheat%20Sheet)
>**Anti-Muslim Movie Maker a Meth Cooker: The man behind the incendiary film, Innocence of Muslims, has a criminal record that includes a narcotics conviction. According to a source close to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula was arrested by the L.A. Country Sheriff's Department on March 27, 1997 and charged with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.** He pleaded guilty and was sentenced on Nov. 3, 1997 to one year in county jail and three years probation. The D.A.’s office said he violated probation on April 8, 2002, and was re-sentenced to another year in county jail.  Nakoula had been registered to vote as a Democrat from 2002-2008, according to the L.A. County Registrar Recorder’s office. In April of 2008, he changed his political affiliation to American Independent.

* Los Angeles law enforcement officials [had already been monitoring Nakoula, including during the event claimed to have been the film's sparsely attended ""premiere"" in Hollywood.](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/13/mohammed-movie-s-mystery-director.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=cheatsheet_afternoon&cid=newsletter%3Bemail%3Bcheatsheet_afternoon&utm_term=Cheat%20Sheet)
> The director didn’t watch his creation the night of the premiere. Instead, he sat by himself at a nearby restaurant, staring intensely at the theater, the law enforcement source told The Daily Beast. What he didn’t know was that he was being watched by officers. **“You are monitoring the people in the area for behavioral characteristics, and he was displaying them. Normal people don’t act like that. He was across the street, on the opposite side of the block, so he could view what was going on. He was sweating and focusing in on the entrance. He was watching what was going on around and who was going in,”** the source said.


I believe there's very strong evidence here that a low cost, high concept plan was at work to manufacture this video. The fact that it was used as incitement for an attack that also appears to have been organized has only raised my suspicions further. I do not claim to know who or what purpose was actually behind creating this video, but I'm certain that there are serious questions here that need to be answered.",237,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/ztiew/reviewing_all_of_the_current_reported_facts/,1347540693.0,ztiew

Original Post:

I’m currently reading *How Democracies Die* by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, which is a great book, and in it they reference political scientist [Juan Linz’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Linz) “ ‘litmus test’ for identifying antidemocratic politicians” (chapter 1, pages 21-24 specifically). Linz proposed this test, but didn’t fully develop it, back in the 1970s, and it attempts to provide an object measure for identifying any politician who has authoritarian / antidemocratic behavior. Before we get into that though, I’ll take a minute to explain the purpose of this post.

 

These days, there’s a fire hose of news and information each day about happenings in America. This tends to be overwhelming, but also can cause specific events to become forgotten by the onslaught of the next day’s new events; without a significant amount of evidential backing, it can be difficult or frustrating to see the broad picture of what’s happening on a federal level (without significant evidence, claims that any administration leans authoritarian can be brushed off as mere fearmongering). I’m hoping to make this post a hub for organizing and discussing information that either discredits the idea of the Trump administration leaning authoritarian, or otherwise supports it by specifically using Linz’s criteria as an objective measure.

 

In an attempt to do this in an organized way, I’ve listed the categories of Linz’s test below (1, 2, 3, 4) along with each’s criteria (A, B, C, D). All are listed here in the main post for easy reading, but I’ve copied each of these points and posted them as individual comments below too. Feel free to have general discussions as separate comments on this post, but if you feel like you have an example that does meet one of the criteria then please post it under my appropriately corresponding comment (for example, if you feel like there's an instance when Trump or his administration sponsored or encouraged mob attacks on opponents, post a link evidencing it specifically under my comment labeled 3.B). For the sake of having higher odds of lesser biased and more accurate sources, when citing a media source I would ask that you please use the [Ad Fontes Media](https://app.adfontesmedia.com/chart/interactive) bias chart as a guide for selecting credible sites. If you do not view the current Trump administration as leaning authoritarian, please post links supporting that idea or otherwise point out how a cited example doesn’t violate the respective criteria (doing this would by its very nature ‘make’ a case that the administration is not authoritarian through lack of supporting evidence).

 

Now that all of that’s out of the way, here are the four categories of Linz's test, along with each’s criteria:

 

**1) Rejection of (or weak commitment to) democratic rules of the game.**

**A)** Do they reject the Constitution or express a willingness to violate it?

**B)** Do they suggest a need for antidemocratic measures, such as canceling elections, violating or suspending the constitution, banning certain organizations, or restricting basic civil or political rights?

**C)** Do they seek to use (or endorse the use of) extraconstitutional means to change the government, such as military coups, violent insurrections, or mass protests aimed at forcing a change in the government?

**D)** Do they attempt to undermine the legitimacy of elections, for example, by refusing to accept credible electoral results?

\-

**2) Denial of the legitimacy of political opponents.**

**A)** Do they describe their rivals as subversive, or opposed to the existing constitutional order?

**B)** Do they claim that their rivals constitute an existential threat, either to national security or to the prevailing way of life?

**C)** Do they baselessly describe their partisan rivals as criminals, whose supposed violation of the law (or potential to do so) disqualifies the from full participation in the political arena?

**D)** Do they baselessly suggest that their rivals are foreign agents, in that they are secretly working in alliance with (or the employ of) a foreign government – usually an enemy one?

\-

**3) Toleration or encouragement of violence.**

**A)** Do they have ties to armed gangs, paramilitary forces, militias, guerrillas, or other organizations that engage in illicit violence?

**B)** Have they or their partisan allies sponsored or encouraged mob attacks on opponents?

**C)** Have the tacitly endorsed violence by their supporters by refusing to unambiguously condemn it and punish it?

**D)** Have they praised (or refused to condemn) other significant acts of political violence, either in the past or elsewhere in the world?

\-

**4) Readiness to curtail civil liberties of opponents, including media.**

**A)** Have they supported laws or policies that restrict civil liberties, such as expanded libel or defamation laws, or laws restricting protest, criticism of the government, or certain civil or political organizations?

**B)** Have they threatened to take legal or other punitive action against critics in rival parties, civil society, or the media?

**C)** Have they praised repressive measures taken by other governments, either in the past or elsewhere in the world?",328,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1lrqxtz/what_evidence_is_there_to_support_or_discredit/,1751656507.0,1lrqxtz
media bias,politicaldiscussion,When Will We See a Resolution to the Halting of the 'ObamaCare' Risk Adjustment Program?,"I've seen numerous posts on this topic in the various politics and news subreddits, but most of the discussion is centered around the idea that this is a biased or extralegal action on the part of the Trump Administration aimed at further hamstringing the ACA. Most articles however make it clear that the decision came as a result of contradictory US District Court rulings from separate States with regard to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS's) justification for the methodologies at work in the program. Namely, the District Court in New Mexico held that the agency had not adequately laid out their reasoning for using the metrics currently in place which allow for the redistribution of funds toward higher-risk pools. To contrast, a court in Massachusetts upheld the program in its current form. A key question moving forward will be whether CMS is going to be able to show that their formula for risk adjustment accomplishes its stated goals in a budget-neutral way as mandated in the ACA.

In light of these rulings, my questions are as follows: how soon can we expect a resolution on this? Further, does the CMS' current formula objectively provide a good explanation for how the Risk Adjustment Program maintains budget-neutrality? Finally, since the program ""only"" affected $10.4 billion in transfers for the 2017 benefit year, how large of an impact will this current state of limbo have on the rate of premium increases?

For much of the information on this topic, I referred to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' [Press Release](https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2018-Press-releases-items/2018-07-07.html) on the matter.",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/8x8333/when_will_we_see_a_resolution_to_the_halting_of/,1531110154.0,8x8333
media bias,politicaldiscussion,"According to a recent Pew Poll, Republicans see ""news organizations being able to criticize political leaders"" as a lot less essential to a democracy than Democrats. Why is this?","According to a recent Pew Research poll, [only 49% of Republicans view a free press that can criticize their political leaders as ""very important"" for a democracy vs. 76% of democrats.](http://www.people-press.org/2017/03/02/large-majorities-see-checks-and-balances-right-to-protest-as-essential-for-democracy/#survey-report)  Most of the other factors showed much smaller divisions when broken down by party, so this stuck out at me.

I mean I could just chock that up to Trump's recent statements calling the press [""the enemy of the American people""](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/business/trump-calls-the-news-media-the-enemy-of-the-people.html), but I feel like he wouldn't be making such strong statements repeatedly unless he and his advisors already knew Republicans would be sympathetic about it.  Arguably Trump's attack on the media could be a symptom rather than the cause of the right's apathy about the freedom of the press.  

The thing is that this poll wasn't just about whether the mainstream media should be free to criticize their leaders (which most Republicans see as biased against their party).  It was about all news organizations, so they're also saying FOX's and Breitbart's ability to criticize Obama during his administration weren't very important to democracy.

media bias,politicaldiscussion,The Oregon Trail: America's West-Winded Migration,"This is an old prediction article I wrote in 2012 and haven't re-read in years. Figured I'd post it here and see if anyone wants to discuss it, so that I can reflect on that discussion after the 2016 election (when some of the predictions can start to be tested).

------------------

The 2012 election marked a number of huge milestones in left-wing progress. Among the major victories: Democratic Presidential incumbent Barack Obama won another four years in office, with a 51% majority (while the Republican candidate received one million fewer votes than his predecessor four years ago); marijuana was fully legalized in two states; gay marriage was legalized in several more; and the Democratic party combined with liberal independents gained a Senate majority of 55.

This was no fluke. The conservative base is dwindling, while liberalism is expanding; the older generation is dying out, the younger generation is growing old enough to vote (and mature enough to, well, actually vote), and the Flynn effect is noticeable in such a sizable gap - the younger voters are smarter on average, and their decisions are reflecting that. The results of this election were the final confirmation for me: the United States has passed the midpoint of a transformation that began in 1988 when Oregon changed from a red state to blue, and continued in 1992 as others followed in its trail.

American political alignment is shifting as a whole - and it is decidedly moving to the left.
Does this mean the end of the Republican party and all conservative influence? Truthfully, no. In fact, I can't even say with confidence that it means even the most extreme right-wing ideologies will be out of the picture any time too soon. We aren't through this transformation, or even quite approaching the end - we're just about half way there.

What's really important about this milestone is that it is the point where we can be sure of a progressive future. Having passed the transformation's midpoint, it is now a virtual guarantee that the rest of the change has to happen.

Here's why: **we will never see another conservative extremist in the White House**. The nation is simply no longer far-right enough for it to happen. The Republican party will have to put more moderate candidates forward before they can win another Presidency.

Unfortunately for them, the Republican party is very stubborn. They won't accept this quickly. The 2016 elections will likely see another radical right-winger, and another loss for the GOP. This will drive even more young voters away from the Republican party, as they will see it losing relevance.

Meanwhile, the liberal agenda will make leaps of progress under a Democratic administration, likely including such changes as nationwide legalization of gay marriage, an end to federal marijuana prohibition, fairer taxes, and perhaps improvements to personal privacy and civil rights.

In addition, if the Republicans still haven't offered a moderate candidate by 2020, third parties will likely gain tremendous momentum as the country looks for someone new to fill the competitive gap against the Democrats.

By the time the Republicans have primarily accepted the implausiblity of another extremist victory, they will already have lost considerable ground. They will have to put forward a candidate so moderate that they could today align themselves as a conservative Democrat. Meanwhile, the Democratic party will have shifted further to the left.

At this point, around the time of the 2020 or 2024 Presidential Election, the U.S. will be a center-aligned nation on the global scale.

But the change won't be done yet. In the wake of the Republican party's new moderation, as well as continued improvement in information-gathering and education compared to today, right-wing media bias and scare-mongering will become unsustainable. In order to stay afloat, major media corporations like Fox News will be forced to begin reporting objectively and factually. In addition, the young left-wing generation of today will now be adults, and childhood indoctrination of conservative viewpoints will be dwindling rapidly.

Over the course of the next few decades after this point, the U.S. will be shifting further and further to the left, moving from the center of the global scale. Soon, we will be one of the world's most left-leaning nations.

**Twenty-four years ago, Oregon marked one of the early signs of a national transformation by suddenly voting Democrat in the Presidential election. Four years ago, we were one of the more right-leaning nations in the world on a global scale. But twenty-four years from now, by 2036, we will be one of the most left-leaning.**

We, as liberals, have passed the midpoint of our fight for progress. Victory is finally within sight. We will absolutely get there if we keep fighting.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3rtwja/the_oregon_trail_americas_westwinded_migration/,1446854821.0,3rtwja

While hiding or being disingenuous of their own teams flirtation with the McCarthy-ites.

For those who think parents should not have a choice and there should be no exception, I would say that using the power of the state to jail people for not vaccinating (in light of MMR not having a chance of causing a deadly pandemic ala Contagion) do you really think there is the political will to use this power in the united states especially if they start rounding people up? The backlash to that would hurt the pro-vaccination camp IMO. 

Further, both Christie and Obama hold the same position if you actually get passed the media soundbyte. Paul is least articulate of bunch, but no one to my knowledge has come around to the reddit opinion it should be mandatory by force of law without exception.

media bias,politicaldiscussion,"Fact-Checking PolitiFacts verdict on Jon Stewart saying, ""FOX viewers are consistently the most misinformed""","Foreword: Warning, this is incredibly long. I really tried to be as thorough as possible, so my apologies for the length. If you want a TL;DR, start at the conclusion.

In June 2011, Politifact published their review of the claim made by Jon Stewart regarding FOX having the most consistently misinformed citizenry.

I rely on websites like Politifact and FactCheck to give an often reliable if not a baseline answer on the validity of political claims. They often do an excellent job regardless of partisanship; but every time I revisit this claim it strikes me as lacking merit for its ""False"" verdict.

[Here's the PolitiFact article](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/20/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-says-those-who-watch-fox-news-are-most/)

[Here's the extended-interview where Stewart makes the claim while being a guest on Chris Matthew's show](http://youtu.be/XV2MxD779c0)

In terms of the knowledge of FOX viewers, I've researched this quite  for a while now, and I have to say that to a degree Politifact's answer requires a reexamination of the evidence presented. Given the reasoning below, I believe PolitiFact is obligated to merit Stewart at the very least, a Half-Truth going by their own rubric:

There was evidence then, and there is more evidence now to suggest much validity in Stewart's claim. Keep in mind I'm not looking for a ""True"" verdict. But my intention is to convince you, and politifact, that it merits either a Half-True or Mostly-True verdict.

[FOX News reported the biggest errors/misperceptions during the Iraq War, having the largest audience who believed in clear falsehoods[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel_controversies#Tests_of_knowledge_of_Fox_viewers) — this refers to the 2003 study as cited in the Politifact article.

[Under Political Knowledge, Fox News is in the bottom quarter of news outlets, with NPR and Daily Show occupying the top 5[2]](http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/27/section-4-demographics-and-political-views-of-news-audiences/) — this is a more recent study by PEW compared to the referenced 2007 one in the article.

[Further study showing FOX at the bottom and Daily Show and NPR at the top **PDF**[3]](http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2012/confirmed/final.pdf)

>In most cases those who had greater levels of exposure to news sources had lower levels of misinformation. **There were, however, a number of cases where greater exposure to a particular news source increased misinformation on some issues.**

>(Those who watched Fox News almost daily were significantly more likely than those who never watched it to believe that most economists estimate the stimulus caused job losses (8 points more likely), most economists have estimated the health care law will worsen the deficit (31 points), the economy is getting worse (26 points), most scientists do not agree that climate change is occurring (30 points), the stimulus legislation did not include any tax cuts (14 points), their own income taxes have gone up (14 points), the auto bailout only occurred under Obama (13 points), when TARP came up for a vote most Republicans opposed it (12 points) and that it is not clear that Obama was born in the United States (31 points). The effect was also not simply a function of partisan bias, as people who voted Democratic and watched Fox News were also more likely to have such misinformation than those who did not watch it--though by a lesser margin than those who voted Republican.

There were cases with some other news sources as well. Daily consumers of MSNBC and public broadcasting (NPR and PBS) were higher (34 points and 25 points respectively) in believing that it was proven that the US Chamber of Commerce was spending money raised from foreign sources to support Republican candidates. Daily watchers of network TV news broadcasts were 12 points higher in believing that TARP was signed into law by President Obama, and 11 points higher in believing that most Republicans oppose TARP."" — [source](http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brunitedstatescanadara/671.php?nid=&id=&pnt=671&l)

The PolitiFact article explicitly notes the validity of some studies supporting Stewart's claim, but refuses to have this weigh on the final-decision in any way. To list this answer as False is grossly misleading on its own. 

To pick apart these studies without granting them weight in the conclusion is contradictory to what was done with the analysis of the PEW studies. PolitiFact cherry-picked out those studies indicating FOX at the bottom (or low-end) of the ranking and then cherry-picked *in* the certain shows within the FOX conglomerate that did well. Just as with every other media-source, it should be understood that we're looking at the viewership as a whole. PolitiFact pulled a subset to erroneously represent all of FOX, which conflicts with the claim's wording. This is important because Jon did not isolate O'Reilly, he explicitly says, ""Fox.""

This appears to be the case with the 2007, and 2008 study analysis. In the 2008 study, however, it's noted CNBC, Local, and Network news ranks just below FOX. In the 2010 study, they manage to beat CNN and MSNBC. That's fair, but they're not far off either, and overall they're once more near the bottom of the knowledge-spectrum. Finally, an updated 2012 publication of the same news-media analysis by PEW indicates FOX effectively drops further, now losing to MSNBC and CNN [Source here again](http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/27/section-4-demographics-and-political-views-of-news-audiences/).

>But a few were in a bit grayer area, often asking respondents to gauge what experts have concluded about policy trends.

>One was, ""Is it your impression that most economists who have studied it estimate that the stimulus has created (a) saved or created several million jobs, (b) saved or created a few jobs, or (c) caused job losses.""

The writer appears to disregard that this judgement on the stimulus was performed by a panel of 55-60 Economists of the WSJ, one of the most [trusted news sources.](http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/section-1-media-sources-distinct-favorites-emerge-on-the-left-and-right/). Additionally, according to the 2010 PEW study, the WSJ actually outpaced every other network in the news—possibly due to how economically-driven current-events were at the time. Additionally, the CBO agreed, for which Politifact uses as a regular source as well in its fact-checking claims. 

The primary disclaimer for why these studies are irrelevant is quoted, here:

>We think there’s a difference between bestowing a False rating on an elected official -- whose job it is to know about public policy -- and calling an ordinary American ""misinformed"" for getting the exact same question ""wrong."" At the very least, these questions seem less clear-cut than asking who the vice president is. For this reason, we believe that this study should carry less weight in analyzing Stewart’s comment.

It appears the rationale for this is that Jon Stewart says misinformed rather than uninformed. Either way, isn't it understood that if you're uninformed, you're also to some degree misinformed out of ignorance or apathy? The validity of the study is not in question, and moreover does the writer skirt the point that there are news sources who do not have near the degree of an uninformed (or misinformed) audience. This isn't about measuring what Americans should and should not know versus elected officials, but a direct comparison of knowledge among news audiences. Since Politifact has no grounds to discredit the study's justification of whether the stimulus worked or not, the bottom-line is that many news outlet audiences faired better in answering the same exact question. 

Moreover this isn't relevant to the validity of the claim; this is an explanation for *why* they're uninformed or misinformed. That has little to no bearing in the scope of this claim.

This reasoning is also at odds with the reasoning drawn in the conclusion:

>So we have three Pew studies that superficially rank Fox viewers low on the well-informed list, but in several of the surveys, Fox isn’t the lowest, and other general-interest media outlets -- such as network news shows, network morning shows and even the other cable news networks -- often score similarly low. Meanwhile, particular Fox shows -- such as The O’Reilly Factor and Sean Hannity’s show -- actually score consistently well, occasionally even outpacing Stewart’s own audience.

The writer jumps back and forth in terms of whether the studies are considered valid and merit-worthy. 

The 2003 study, for example, dated though it may be, was effectively ignored in the final decision without granting a reason despite a direct acknowledgement of its validity and congruency with Jon's claim. As was the 2010 World Public Opinion report on semantical grounds circling around what it means to be misinformed:

>Meanwhile, the other set of knowledge surveys, from worldpublicopinion.org, offer mixed support for Stewart. The 2003 survey strikes us as pretty solid, but the 2010 survey has been critiqued for its methodology.

Politifact discredits the 2010 survey seemingly because there was a large reprisal from the right, but offered little depth to their casting the study out on grounds of methodology. 

>The way Stewart phrased the comment, it’s not enough to show a sliver of evidence that Fox News’ audience is ill-informed. The evidence needs to support the view that the data shows they are ""consistently"" misinformed -- a term he used not once but three times. It’s simply not true that ""every poll"" shows that result. So we rate his claim False.

Not a ""**sliver**"" of evidence? That seems awfully disingenuous. Moreover did the author fall victim just as much so as Jon with semantics, saying ""ill-informed"" rather than misinformed or uninformed. I could just as easily see a rational conclusion saying, 
""Jon's wording was somewhat overreaching, nevertheless in every open study conducted on the knowledge of news media outlets, FOX as a whole did rank low or last in certain instances. Given that Jon said misinformed rather than uninformed and that FOX did not always rank last, we rate this claim Half-True."" 

Finally, there have been other studies since then. A 2012 report indicates  that FOX viewers may be less informed than those who even subscribe to ""no news."" MSNBC fell below the ""No News"" category, as well:  http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2012/confirmed/

Another published report out of Stanford in 2010 is titled, ""[Frequent Viewers of Fox News Are Less Likely to Accept Scientists' Views of Global Warming. **PDF**]( http://woods.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/files/Global-Warming-Fox-News.pdf)""


**Conclusion**


I contest that Politifact's own [rubric](http://www.politifact.com/about/) isn't in line with the evidence presented, here, and that the conclusion drawn is contradictory with the criticism throughout the article. [I'm also not the only one who disagrees.](http://mediamatters.org/research/2011/06/22/jon-stewart-gets-it-right-about-fox-news/180787#2). MediaMatters lists the chain-of-events and responses from other individuals, including the director of World Public Opinion, along with very studies and citations. 

**Politifact's Rubric:**

>Mostly True – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

>Half True – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

>Mostly False – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

>False – The statement is not accurate.

So while PolitiFact will unlikely change their verdict to Half-True or Mostly True, I want it to be very clear that the reality is FOX viewers as a whole are much less informed, if not misinformed from the general-public. Being sometimes at and often near the bottom of every list does not merit an outright discrediting of Stewart's claims. People should be aware that if you're looking for reliable news, you have to be selective. Fox is not a source for reliable, untinted, news.

Let me reiterate what was also mentioned in the article: that distinguishing what is an already-informed audience and an audience being informed by a news source is difficult to discern. Nonetheless with FOX, we can generally rule out they certainly are not accurate in informing their audience. It's likely those who score high in O'Reilly in the PEW study, for example, equate to the audience that scores highly with watching The Daily Show. 

I would say that this is not relevant anymore and ignore any evidence uncovered in the time after the claim was made—that is to say leave your verdict as it stands. However, this PolitiFact article is still linked to quite often (and referenced by Fox, themselves) and leads people to erroneously believe the contrary idea that, ""FOX is up there with the best of them.""—a false-equivalence notion. It's important people understand new evidence has come up. With something as complicated and nuanced as this, to represent the truth properly—an objective no good Journalist takes lightly—(and granting some slide with semantics), your truth-o-meter has to slide at least in the direction of the truth.  With that, I still urge PolitiFact to change the Truth-O-Meter verdict to Half-True if not Mostly-True. 

This is quite-frankly the end-all and an immense source of where division and partisanship stems from. Both MSNBC and Fox as well as others—though FOX moreso given its viewership—are largely doing Americans a disservice in being obligated to inform the citizenry. 

Depending on how narrow our acceptibility for precision is, many out there would just as easily agree with Politifact in that going by an exceptionally rigid standard, Stewart's claim is false; I likely won't convince these people of seeing the big picture, here. Nonetheless a claim that is justified is that there are much, much better news sources out there.

I took the time to write this because I think this is one of the most important, straight-forward facts people need to be aware of in order to get reasonable discussion going and increase focus on bigger issues rather than the false-equivalence partisanship narrative. Because of this, this topic is incredibly touchy and subject to casting out large sums of evidence on the grounds of political-bias. Time and again I reiterate the point that the truth and ignorance both often tend to have a bias, it's up to you to discern which is which. Whether it's politically-correct or not, I absolutely attribute our disengaged citizenry in the polito-sphere to mainstream and conservative news-outlets purporting to be on even-keel with the networks they themselves criticize.

media bias,politicaldiscussion,Bystander Theory of Social Responsibility - Ideological Reform,"Note: I understand that this may be seen as a radical viewpoint and lacks in-depth factual support. Please note that many things I say stem from personal bias and beliefs.


Abstract:  I believe that the business ideals have caused certain people to take advantage of a lot of things meant to benefit the people (i.e. healthcare, education,banking, etc) whether it be under good or bad intentions. In my opinion, there are a lot of unanswered questions regarding integrity. I also believe that ideological reform and an increased collective curiosity is vital to find the answers to those questions in order to make a concrete change. I truly believe that we can make our efforts for reform more efficient and in turn a positive experience for everyone no matter how small the difference.

The Bystander Theory of Social Responsibility

In short, the Bystander Theory is the expectation of someone else to take the responsibility of action in an unfortunate event. In most cases, nobody does. It hinges on the idea that it is more beneficial to the individual to not get involved. 
 
A famous relation is the Holocaust. Some Germans/Nazis who participated in inhumane actions may not have necessarily agreed with the cause. However, fear of the consequences of rejecting the ideology of German superiority and lack of options to make a change left reluctant obedience as the wisest choice. A lesser and somewhat fictitious example is a robber who steals a woman’s purse. She cries out for help, but nobody helps her thinking that someone else will act or deeming the possibility of danger for getting involved.

In my opinion, America as well as many other countries is in need of reform in multiple areas. Although I do think that certain steps such as laws or systematical changes are needed, I believe a change in ideology is vital for any meaningful change to occur. We as a people have caught the “illness” of (for lack of a better phrase) ""helpless apathy"" towards taking individual responsibility. That is why I call this idea the bystander theory of social responsibility. I too, have a bad case of ""helpless apathy"". My personal perspective is that I cannot think of viable ways to contribute that would result in positive and tangible results. 

Here are some cause/effects of the Bystander Theory of Social Responsibility:

1) Desensitization to negative events by media:

They say that bad news is what makes the money. A caveat to all this exposure to bad news is the desensitization to it. Instead of feeling sad, angered, or possibly disgusted, we have accepted it as daily life and integrate into how our society works. In turn, we may have lost a portion of our empathy. 

2) ""Helpless apathy"" due to lack of tangible ways to make improvements as an individual as well as the perceived necessity of personal sacrifice.

To piggyback off my first symptom, when we constantly hear or see all these bad things happening, it’s almost like an overwhelming flood of negativity. It's analogous to procrastination. We've procrastinated in trying to make a change and day by day the work required piles up. 

I think this leads to our ""helpless apathy"". By seeing all these negative events, we can feel at a loss to do anything about it. 

Not only that, we all have our own lives to live. The time and effort to make a legitimate change may call for the long-term sacrifice to our own well-being, dreams, and pursuit of happiness. These sacrifice do not necessitate improvement. Therefore, the most viable option can be apathy. That is why I believe a collective ideological change to make a slightly greater conscious effort from each of us would lessen the load and present more opportunities to contribute. I think that anything as small as talking to your friends and family about social/political issues or brainstorming ideas can create seeds in our minds to grow.

3) Lack of public backlash makes it conducive for people in power to make questionable decisions (under the assumption that they MIGHT be). 

To continue from symptom 1 & 2, I believe ""helpless apathy"" is what allows people in power to continue to  commit questionable acts in the name of good business. Without a sufficient public backlash, they do not feel the social stigma of the any negative consequences whether their intentions were good or bad. The ""good"" moral standard or business ideals of their actions does not necessarily have to equate to a benefit for the American people. 

A personal example is the health insurance offered by my school. This year, I am paying the same amount that I am last year, but the amount of coverage we receive has actually gone down. This doesn’t affect me directly (fingers crossed) and it’s most likely that nobody or enough people will speak out against it for the coverage to go back up. 

My analysis of the situation in terms of cause and effect is –

Cause: the desire to increase profit margins at any cost caused my school to do this. This can be viewed as good business and not necessarily done with ill will.

Effect: by increasing their profits and without feeling any repercussions, it’s conducive for them to continue to act in this way in other areas, i.e. raising tuition, meal plan prices, etc.

I believe many other situations are similar to this example and are affecting our lives as a combined negative result to varying degrees. Could there be a buildup in consumer loss from slightly overpaying every time we go to the supermarket or other goods? Is the American education system too focused on grades or looking good on paper as a reflection of the prestige of our schools at the detriment of building critical thinking skills? By not taking sufficient action, we may be unknowingly empowering these types of decisions and actions for ""good business with bad consequences"".

I believe it is possible to make steps in the right direction if we gain a greater public awareness of issues and ask more questions as a whole. By questioning the authorities strongly enough with a united voice, they may start to question and further address these issues themselves.


4) A negative effect - Retaliation by crime:

If you've seen the movie John Q, John’s son has a heart condition that threatens his life. Since John’s health insurance is not sufficient to cover an operation, his son will die. Therefore, John decides to take the hospital emergency room hostage in order to save his son’s life. He committed a crime, but to a certain degree his actions could be justified. 

John Q cause and effect – 

Cause: health care is a mostly privatized industry and so by trying to increase operating/profit margins, some people cannot afford necessary treatments. 

Effect: The only viable option that John saw was to commit a crime to save his son’s life.

In a sense, the justification is that while the health care industry commit a crime by law, they are in a sense committing a crime against humanity. The only way for John to save his son’s life was being capable of paying a sufficient sum of money. If you’ve seen Elysium, the idea here is similar. Money equals treatment, and vice versa. 

But what about other crimes that may not seem justified? Let's use an extreme and generalized example for drug dealing. Drug dealing is commonly prevalent in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods. You could say that drugs are what causes people to stay in that specific economic class, but that may not necessarily be wholly true. Despite the capitalistic society we live in, it’s hard to climb the ladder. Education is weaker and less enforced for those in a lower social standing and college has become decreasingly affordable. It is arguable that opportunities are also harder to come by and in turn give youth a lesser chance to develop their minds. For some, it may have gotten to the point where drug dealing is an option to live a “better” life over giving a full effort in school. As a generalization, ignoring personal moral guidelines and committing crimes may be in their self-interest in improving their personal well-being.

---

To summarize:
My main point is that I believe that ideological reform is important. Ideological reform can be in the form of reading an article on a political or social issue, talking to others, or even giving a homeless man a dollar can build up to something greater. Despite the idea that being a bystander is inconsequential, it may be for in our self interest and betterment of our friends, family, and our country to make a greater effort.

Thanks~

Edit: For those who disagree, I would actually like to hear your thoughts.

Edit: I gave a lot of harsh responses to people who were courteous enough to give their inputs. We're all here for the same reason, to think of ways to improve America, and I let my pride and emotions get the best of me. Reform/corruption has become a passionate topic of mine, and it wasn't my intention to stir bad feelings. Sorry guys, especially Cassander and GarryOwen.

media bias,politicaldiscussion,Brand's video is thought-provoking.,"A lot of genuinely cool people that I know have been talking about it, so I thought, gee, I should watch it too…and was disappointed. 

So then I asked myself, why do all of these really cool people like it? I think it’s because Brand speaks passionately. And he says some things that are true. 

The problem is, he also says a lot of really stupid and dangerous things, but he makes them sound sort of smart by using big words, like “lachrymose”, which is an adjective that means “prone to crying.” (It’s not a very common word. I only knew it because I recently read it while skimming over a GRE vocabulary list.) He’s also talking really fast, and being funny, and moving around a lot, which makes it hard to think carefully about what he’s saying. 

So I thought, rather than asking for my 12 minutes back, I should engage. Because people are really fired up—they care, and that’s awesome. It’s useful when people express their feelings and try to use their privilege to motivate change, so let’s give him the benefit of the doubt and talk about what he says. For my part, that means that I should explain why I find this video so objectionable. In doing so, I’m going to simplify some really complex problems, and I’m doing that to make them as clear as possible, so we can talk about what to do about them. Because I really, truly care. I just disagree with Brand.

So here’s a metaphor. It’s not perfect, but it’s something concrete to grab on to. Brand is talking about vaguely defined problems at a high level of abstraction, which makes them difficult to understand. Think of this story like one of those Find Your Own Adventure books. We’re going to use it to explore our choices.

1. Introducing the Boat Metaphor
We wake up and find ourselves out at sea, sailing on a ship called the U.S.A. Boats are the way that we get around in the world. Different parts do different things. We divide these up into social, economic, and political parts, and when we talk about problems, we usually focus on specific parts that do specific things, but really they all sort of work together to make a whole boat. And of course, those boats are related to other boats in some even more ridiculously complicated ways, but we’ll just talk about one boat for now. Brand is actually on the U.K. boat, but since a lot of Americans are promoting his video, Brand can be a kind of place-holder for any American who thinks that we should apply what he says to our boat.

Our boat is modeled on a few other types of boats, like democracies. Democracies give everyone a say in the general living conditions of the boat. One advantage is that there are lots of individuals who can share their unique perspectives, and this results in a lot of ideas being generated for how to make the boat better, which is supposed to make them more seaworthy. People have sailed a lot of other types of boats in human history, and surprisingly many were really awful. For example, autocracy—giving individuals absolute power—tends to be a bad idea. The captain gets totally wasted on power. He loses any idea of what it is like to be anyone else, and thinks that he is the most awesome guy in the world. He thinks that everyone should be like, super happy to serve him because he’s obviously right about everything. And we all know people like this, right? So, he ends up abusing everyone else until they mutiny or the ship wrecks. That’s one example of a bad kind of boat, and there are many more.

2. The Current Situation
If you study human history, you’ll find that things are actually a lot better now than they used to be, at least in certain respects. We have cut the global poverty rate in half in mere decades, which is incredibly fast. Billions of people are rising out of extreme poverty. We tend to ignore numbers, so let me say that again in a different way. Imagine that you and your family were literally dying of starvation, but now you now have water, food, shelter, and better access to health care, education and information. How important is that difference to you? That’s right, it’s everything. Now multiply that by a billion. Can you even get a grip on how awesome that is? No, me neither. The point is that this is not trivial. These are real people’s lives, and this matters. That’s not to say there are not serious problems, but we’re doing a lot better, and we are changing at a pretty fast clip. And it’s good that we’re changing quickly, because a clear look at the world shows that we need it. We’re definitely doing some things wrong. But, we are also doing some things right, because we already know that things could sure be a lot worse. So, you know, it matters how we go about changing things. I am pretty sure that most of us do not want to end up on the North Korea boat.

When the U.S.A. first got going, our boat was called a democracy, but really the equal rights only applied to a certain class of people, which was a huge problem. First, we stole the materials to build the ship, including the labor. We also forced the people we stole it from to get on the boat with us. In the beginning we were really a slave ship, where most of the hard labor of rowing the boat was done in brutal conditions below deck while very few enjoyed a leisurely life on deck, and there was no movement between the decks. Half the population was kept in cages, although the conditions of the cages were really different, depending on what deck you happened to be on. So, yeah, we had awful problems. But, things have been getting better. A long way from perfect, of course—but better. Things are better because people fought for change, and because we have a system that allows change. 

Right now, the boat has some holes in it, and it is heavily tilted. It’s taking on water, in fact, and it’s possible that the boat could sink. Most people think that this is obvious, because they’re down in the area of the boat that’s sinking. Some people are drowning, others can barely keep their heads above water, and it’s crowded and scary and people are desperately trying to climb up a slippery deck. Meanwhile, a few lucky people are high and dry—never higher, never better views, never fewer people up on the top deck! It’s hard for some of them to see what’s wrong, because from their perspective things look peachy and they’re not looking too closely at the ship or the effects on the rest of the sailors. That’s a pretty serious situation indeed! Brand is definitely right to point out that we are in trouble, and it’s kind of him to be looking down from the top and at least try to get everyone’s attention. So far, so good.

3. Captain, We’re Humped! What Do We Do?
The key question is: how do we make things better? Brand says that he doesn’t have an answer—but then plows ahead and gives us choices, such as not voting, and vaguely calling for revolution. And this is where I part ways from Brand. Because as much as our situation currently sucks, remember that we are doing some things right, and that things could certainly be a lot worse. So, what stays, and what goes?

4. Not Voting
A lot of people fought and died for democracy, and the right to vote. We built a democratic boat for a good reason, and I’m pretty sure that most Americans agree that this is the type of ship we want to be sailing, although we disagree on the details. I’ll just point out—it is ballsy for a white man to tell us not to vote considering that we only very recently fought some bitter battles so that non-whites and women could even get the right to vote. Think things are bad now? Seems like it would sure be a lot easier for things to get worse if people didn’t vote. Do you really think that your not voting is going to somehow give others any kind of reason to check their own behavior? Of course not—they’ll just pursue their own interests and totally run roughshod over yours. I’m going to go ahead and keep exercising my political rights, because if I don’t, I can pretty much guarantee that someone is going to take them away from me. There’s quite enough of that going on already. It’s actually part of the problem. 

Brand seems to recognize that this is part of the problem, because he says that the system is not responsive to the needs of the people. Which suggests that he thinks it should be, and that probably means a democratic ship, even though he’s talking about the need for a new political paradigm. Ironically, it seems like Brand may want to use a non-democratic way to solve the problem. Which brings us to his second suggestion: revolution. 

5. Revolution
Now, a lot is going to hang on how we imagine the revolution. Revolution could be horrific if he’s talking about burning the boat, or it might actually be pretty awesome if he means it kind of metaphorically, like a revolution in ourselves, although that’s harder to see as a real paradigm change. If you talk that way, it can motivate people, but it’s dangerous not to specify. (The Beatles nailed this one on the head a few decades ago with “Revolution 1”.) So let’s go through the different options quite carefully. We each face the following choice: do nothing, jump off, burn the boat, build an entirely new one, or fix the existing one. 

6. Do nothing
Doing nothing is a very popular option. It can include not voting, but it doesn’t have to. This choice usually stems from a feeling of hopelessness. Now, that is totally understandable. I am sympathetic to that. These problems are really, truly, super-duper next-level tough to even get a handle on, much less solve. And even if you mean well, it’s really hard to maintain the motivation to care all the time, and people get burned out. Some people practice escapism, immersing themselves in activities that otherwise might be perfectly respectable, like watching movies or reading books or playing videogames. We all need breaks to keep working, but the key here is to keep working. Some people ignore the problems to focus on their own lives. After all, most people out there are struggling, and it’s tough to stay above water. So it’s actually really easy to just focus on keeping your own head above water rather than trying to solve the problem—the band-aid option. Other people dismiss the do nothing choice as apathy (lack of caring), but it seems to me that the apathy really comes from hopelessness. Because really, most of us do genuinely care about other people, and we all recognize that a lot of people are suffering. It’s just that most people feel that they can’t do anything about it. And that hopelessness leads to despair. So apathy becomes a way to cope with that despair. We could continue down this path. We’ll most likely sink, but we could also get herded onto a different type of boat altogether if we don’t keep exercising our democratic rights, so either way let’s move on.

7. Jump off
Some people can swim off on their own and manage to fish. Very few people are capable of that, and at any rate that’s a pretty sad and lonely life. It’s not even recognizably human, because what we value most are our relationships with other people. Imagine that you had every material object that you could possibly desire—but absolutely no one to share it with. If you’re like most of us, you’d be totally miserable. This is why people say things like, money can’t buy happiness. We’re social creatures. We’re just not happy unless we have other people to share our lives with.

People who do want to swim on their own can jump off the boat if they want to—sort of. It’s technically against the rules, but those people are extreme individualists that don’t recognize the rules of the boat as authoritative over them anyway, so that point will hardly sway them. They’ll probably be able to get away with it, as long as they go far away, stay away and don’t try to mess with the people in the boats. The rest of us are probably looking for a group solution. The next choice also involves leaving the boat, but taking everyone with you.

7. Burn, Baby, Burn
Calling for revolution without a plan—state-collapse anarchy—is like burning the boat. A lot of people on the boat die, because in a failed state, life is nasty, brutish, and short, to use the famous words of Thomas Hobbes. People who are desperate to save their lives, and their families’ lives, can do (or submit to) some truly horrible things to (or by) other people. There is nothing democratic about this process. Sometimes this is called the state of nature, although there’s nothing natural about it. People will use their advantages to extract concessions from those that remain in the aftermath. This scenario sucks. People who choose to burn the boat haven’t clearly thought through the consequences. Even sociopaths don’t want to burn the boat, because they can see that it’s pretty obviously in their own self-interest to keep sailing with others. It’s pretty much impossible to be convinced of one’s own relative advantage in the ensuing chaos, and if you are, you’re probably delusional. As Hobbes pointed out ages ago, other people can gang up on you. Since this is not a reasonable option, let’s try another alternative: we build a new ship. Note that most anarchists are still with us, because most anarchists are decent people that oppose violence, chaos and destruction—they just want a different ship. In fact, most of them seem to still want a relatively peaceful democratic ship, just one that is pretty different from the one we have right now.

8. Build a New Ship
Whatever you propose for the new ship, you should be pretty confident that you have a clear alternative ship that is better, and also a way of getting everyone to safety. Otherwise, you’re burning the boat. You have two choices: the first is that you can convince people to go along with you; the second is that you force them to. I’ll consider these in reverse order.

Forcing other people to go along with you sounds a lot like totalitarianism. Even if you’re a benevolent and wise person, you’re still only one person, with one perspective on the world. Most of us are pretty corruptible—hence the old saying, power corrupts. You don’t even have to intend to be evil for your perspective to become distorted. According to psychologists, all of us are probably biased. We all heavily favor our own perspective. This becomes a political problem when you have a power advantage and are able to disproportionately advance your own interests. This forcing people option also relies on a pretty crazy assumption—that you know better than the rest of us what is good for us. And really, how could anyone ever be confident of that? Especially if part of what is good for us just is having a say. Again, taking history as our guide, people generally don’t like being forced, and we generally tend to resist.

So really, the reasonable option is to convince people. You’re going to need to persuade everyone to go along with you. Given what we know about human psychology and history, it’s safe to say that we’re going to have some disagreements as to what the best boat looks like—what the details are. So what do we do? Convincing every single person that one particular detail is correct, is crazy hard, if not impossible. But making no decision is worse—we saw that doing nothing, or gridlock, would lead to shipwreck. But there’s an alternative, which is that we can also all agree to submit to the outcome of a fair decision procedure—like voting. A lot of people like the idea that each person should have an equal say, and favor a democratic ship over other types. So maybe, actually, what we need to do is fix the existing ship—we keep a democratic ship, but figure out what we don’t like about the one we’re on. And it seems like given the other options, we should probably use a democratic process to decide what to do. Thankfully, we have one already in place.

9. Fix the Ship
This is starting to look a lot less like a revolution, at least of our fundamental guiding political ideals. A lot of people have successfully created change in the past, usually by having clear goals, creating a plan of action, and being motivated to put that into practice. This helps to get other people to understand why the change is good or necessary. People get nervous about vague alternatives, and it should be fairly obvious by now why that might be. It’s also starting to become more obvious why most of us are not taking to the streets.

So the key is to get specific. Now there are a lot of things wrong with our ship, but there is one that Brand talked about, which is a lack of responsiveness. That is, our democracy seems to be failing in an important respect. The whole idea of democracy is that it is responsive to the needs of the people, and we should figure out why that’s not actually happening. People on both sides of the political spectrum feel as though the ship is being steered in a direction that they don’t want to go—and they’re right, because we have our sails arranged in such a way that really powerful forces can blow the ship off course.

I said before that the ship had lots of parts, that all work together. Democracy is a political ideal, and it’s compatible with a bunch of different types of government, and a bunch of different types of economic systems. So let’s look closer at the moving parts.

10. Why is the Ship Sinking?
Remember that our ship is tilted. It’s tilted because of the economic part. Specifically, very few people are controlling most of the wealth. Again, taking history as our guide, great concentrations of wealth usually lead to very bad consequences, and we can see why the situation is unstable. Leaving aside what to do about that, let’s just examine for a minute its effects on political equality. Because whatever you think should be done about economic inequality, most Americans agree that we should at least have political equality. As it turns out, this economic inequality is distorting our political equality because we have political rules that allow it to. And even if we didn’t have stark economic inequality, you might think that it’s a bad idea to have that kind of a design flaw. This particular kind of error will start a vicious cycle—those that spend more, get more power, and can outspend other people, getting even more power, and so on. That is, it will tend to increase inequality over time. And once you erode enough political equality, you’ve actually transformed the ship into a plutocracy, or rule by the wealthy few. So far, I think we can all agree that this is a really bad situation and we should maybe look at changing the political rules. So let’s take a look at how it works.

11. Campaign Financing
Politicians have to raise money to campaign for office. See, they get votes by spending lots on media to try to influence people to vote for them. The presidential candidates alone spent $2 billion in 2012. This pays for those incredibly annoying ads that play almost nonstop in any swing state. Even if you’re not in a swing state, but there’s a hot issue on the ballot, the political ads are still totally out of control. Sometimes you might even agree with the person or issue, but still think that they’re annoying because there’s too many of them. That they are being kind of mean to the other person. That most of what they are saying is probably either untrue or taken out of context or otherwise being unfair. That they are obviously designed not to give you impartial information, but to persuade you. Psychologists have also shown that the more often you encounter information, the more likely you are to judge that it’s true, even if it’s false. So simply hearing the ads repeatedly has an effect. And that’s actually kind of sketchy if you think about it. So this media barrage needs to end, but no one in the media is going to say that, because that’s where all those delicious billions in ad revenue are going.

So where is all this money coming from? Well, remember that bit I just told you about the concentration of wealth. A few people control the vast majority of wealth in this country. They give money. Multinational corporations also give money, which raises a whole bunch of thorny questions about international money influencing the American political process. It also turns out that people are astonishingly susceptible to reciprocity. Remember that bit about us being social creatures? We naturally want to help people who help us. We like them. Even when you think that you are being impartial, you’re not, and this is based on solid psychological research. So, it should hardly be surprising that politicians aren’t really doing a very good job of representing their constituents. Instead, they are responsive to the people who give them money. And that means that political influence doesn’t really come from the majority, but from a few large donors. And again, none of these presupposes any kind of conspiracy or bad intention. Most of us are decent and well-intentioned people who want to do good. But most of us would totally muck things up if we had power under the current system. And we might not even be aware of it, because power and privilege tend to blind you to the perspective of others. So, trying not to be evil isn’t good enough. We need checks and balances. 

We are a representative democracy, which means that we cede political power to elected representatives. This actually works out pretty well, so that the rest of us can spend our time getting on with life. Most of us actually need to be working to keep the ship sailing, because this is a really complicated ship. Complicated ships also give us a lot of benefits, so it’s not a bad arrangement in theory. Congress is supposed to be the most responsive branch of government. It’s supposed to represent the people, which is why we have this whole voting system in the first place. It’s also supposed to represent the people equally (sort of) through one person, one vote. And the idea there is that they are going to represent our interests, because we put them into office in the first place. But there’s a sense in which we’re losing that control, because of this crazy media circus and massive political donations made by very few people. And that means that all the things that ordinary Americans care about, all the things that we agree and disagree on, aren’t really getting addressed in the way that they are supposed to. I’m sure there’s a lot that you and I disagree on, because my own political views don’t fit neatly into any one category. But I can agree to resolve things with you in a fair and democratic manner, because I do think that democracy is preferable to the alternatives. And so maybe we can start by agreeing to at least hold up democracy as something worth fighting for.

The people who have the money certainly aren’t going to do anything about it, and neither are the politicians. The media is not going to make it an issue, because they profit from it. These groups are all doing just fine under the present rules. They’re not motivated to change them. And we don’t even have to suppose that they are trying to be evil. They don’t see what’s wrong with the current rules because they are looking at things from their own perspective, and it’s their own narrow perspective that sets the rules.
That means that if we want change, we need to look into the mirror. More people need to talk about the problems that come from political spending, and be motivated to change the rules. So, it’s awesome that this conversation is taking place. The people still have the ultimate power. If enough of us care, then we can change things. If not, well, our rights will continue to be eroded. And does anyone want to be responsible for just giving up? After all that others have sacrificed so that we could have these rights? Are you going to go passively on to the plutocratic ship? Yeah, me neither.

12. A Solution
Now there are bound to be some disagreements about how to go about fixing the various problems on the ship. So let’s just restrict ourselves to one specific issue that affects the rights of all of us, which is figuring out how to block the economic inequality from robbing our equal political rights. This is something that most of us can probably agree to. After all, none of us want to sail a plutocratic ship, but that’s actually our current course. Let’s leave the economic arguments to the side, because there’s a lot of disagreement about those, and at any rate we would need a working political process to settle them fairly. So let’s focus on that first.

13. No Political Advertising
Here is one idea: we stop political advertising. We can give any given candidate or issue a platform (some other countries give candidates free blocks of media time) to make their case. They can, for instance, tell us what they believe, what their ideals are, what they think should be done about certain problems or issues, and give us some idea of what they’ll do in particular circumstances that come up. And then as a bonus, we don’t have to tune out endless annoying political ads and we can spend that $2 billion on better things.

Some people think that this is a free speech issue: you should be able to speak your political views, so you should be able to spend your money on politics. And, it is really important that people can talk about their political views. The problem here is that some people are spending their money in ways that undermine the political process. And that’s not the same thing as being able to speak your conscience. We already restrict certain things that we might otherwise think count as free speech, like yelling fire in a crowded theater, or forms of lying like slander and libel. And those are off limits because they are really harmful. And we already restrict what you can spend your money on, like not buying and selling people, because that violates people’s rights. In this case, allowing unrestrained spending on political advertising is really harmful—specifically, it’s harmful in a way that is undermining our other political rights, like equal voting. And that seems even more fundamental. I’m a lot more willing to give up political advertising than I am my democratic right to political influence. But that’s the tradeoff that we’re already making. So it seems worth taking another look at.

14. Full Public Financing of Elections
But that doesn’t go far enough, because of course there is all of that notorious lobbying. And special interests would still give politicians money to vote in their favor. So really, it seems that we need full public financing of elections, and to prohibit private donations. People might think that this is expensive. But it will be less expensive if we spend less on media, and it’s almost certainly less expensive than what the taxpayers are essentially handing out right now through laws that are favorable to special interests. Even if it’s not, isn’t a couple of bucks a pretty worthwhile investment if it guards your fundamental political rights? You spend more on car insurance, and that just covers your car. 

Right now, anyone can give money in unlimited amounts. So those who have money are getting their interests taken care of at the expense of the rest of us. Even the judicial branch, which is supposed to serve as a check on the legislative branch, is not immune to this problem. Supreme Court justices can and do have spouses who can run special political action committees (PACs) that can accept unlimited donations from anonymous donors. So, people that have cases before the Supreme Court could, essentially, give a bunch of money to, say, Clarence Thomas, and no one would be able to prove it. And even if you think that Clarence Thomas is a moral saint, remember that point about human psychology and bias. 

15. Why This Problem?
Now, some people think that this is an economic problem. And we definitely do have economic problems, because great concentrations of wealth just aren’t very stable, and they’re not the most efficient allocation of resources. They’re also less resilient to economic downturn. You don’t need to be an economist to see that we could probably get more bang for our buck elsewhere. But we’re not going to solve them when the rules are set by politicians who are under the control of people who are benefiting under the current system. These political rules practically guarantee corruption. Because essentially, the people who are the best off get to set the rules for the rest of us. And that’s not really a democracy any more, now is it? I think the reason that Brand and many others are frustrated is that it seems as though we are much closer to a plutocracy than a democracy. Because the system is responsive to the needs of the few, and not the many. This undermines the advantages of democracy, like the listening to different perspectives part, the part that is supposed to help us spot and solve problems really well. So the more we move towards plutocracy, the harder it is to change things.

Remember that crazy captain? He couldn’t grasp the perspective of anyone else and sunk the ship? That can happen here. It is happening here. And it doesn’t even have to be intentional. Because we’re all biased—no really, read the psychological research, you and me and everyone, we all are totally biased—it’s just that only some of us are so privileged so as to be able to advance our interests at the expense of others. That’s the whole point of equal political rights. The impartiality of the institution is supposed to correct for the partiality of our own views. 

We are all partial, and that’s not a bad thing. We don’t have to get so angry with each other. Our relationships with other people are perhaps the most meaningful part of our lives, and those are essentially partial. It’s natural for parents to love their own kids more than the kids of other people, and give their own kids attention and resources that they don’t give to other kids. Similarly, I have my political opinions, and you have yours, and we are surely going to disagree sometimes. But, as much as I would love to get my own way all the time, I wouldn’t want to get it by taking away your rights. I want the system to be fair, and I think that most of you are with me on this one. I want you to have a say. I want you to vote. I want you to participate. I want this for you, but I also want this for me. Because you have a different perspective than I do, and I can probably learn something from you. It would be crazy for any one person to think that they’ve got a handle on this huge, messy, complicated ship. That’s completely impossible, even for people who live and breathe politics. Anyone who says they’ve got all the answers is either delusional or a liar. So it’s better to have some humility about your own position. We do better as a whole ship by pointing out all the things that we think are wrong with the boat and making a decision together. Because one of the things that unites Americans is that we do believe in democracy. Sometimes that means we’ll have to go along with decisions that we disagree with if they are the outcome of our democratic process.

So yes, Brand, we have problems, and thank you for pointing that out. The solution is not to stop voting. The solution, as I see it, is to empower voting. The solution is not to take undemocratic means—it’s to be more democratic. Without this piece of the puzzle in place, it’s pretty hard to see how we’re going to make any other kind of changes, because what this does is affect our ability to make changes in the first place. It’s also pretty easy to see how our political rights are going to continue to be eroded under the current system. So that’s why we need to solve this problem first.

We’re going to disagree about a lot of the details, but this particular one, I think, is a pretty fundamental one that most Americans can agree to.

media bias,politicaldiscussion,"Many non-issues in American politics aren't non-issues at all - in fact, they're quite the opposite. We NEED people to speak out in these areas right now.","So every time abortion, gay rights, equality, etc. is brought up, at least a few people shout out about how it's a ""non-issue"" and how we should be focusing on economy, foreign policy, jobs, whatever. 

I don't see it as such. In fact, I think that the fact that so many people brush aside ""non-issues"" as unimportant affairs is actually detrimental to the quality of politics, as well as the perception of our politicians. Hear me out. 

So let's look at the most popular things that people would consider ""non-issues,"" especially those that came up during the 2012 election: gay rights, abortion, sexism, racism, the justice system (i.e. Trayvon Martin, anti-protest violence), student loans, tax dodging, and some may even argue the recent NSA spying. 

What do all of these things have in common? 

*Each of these topics highlights a divide in privilege that affects a large portion of the country - half, if not more.* 

Sexual orientation, race, gender, religion, and class are the primary subjects of recent progressive movements, including Occupy, the feminist surge, and the ever-present gay rights movements. If you yourself are not affected by inequality (read: if you are not an average-intelligence, educated, moderately-wealthy white straight cisgendered man), you probably know someone who is affected by one of these prejudices. And chances are that you know at least one person who is politically active in these fields.  

What does this have to do with the deterioration of politics? 

By shrugging off the legitimate opinions of those who are affected by these issues, we are not only ignoring one of their standpoints - we're blocking them out in the main field of politics. 

If we think a woman is overreacting because she's an abortion activist, or a gay politician is only good for his gay rights activism, what do we think of their views on economics, jobs, drugs, immigration? Or better yet, what do those who have influence in their fields have to say about them? Most Congressmen are rich, old white men who endorse other white men, and are paid and endorsed by corporations to hold their standpoint. 

Very few are outspoken about these issues that concern the public directly. However, these few are constantly followed by their own supporters, creating a better representative for their people. Elizabeth Warren, for example, seems to be the new queen of /r/politics. Not for nothing, either - in Massachusetts, she was a hit with liberals, who were glad to see someone step up so boldly. They came for the basic liberal values and stayed for the outcry against big banks. 

The ongoing prejudice in media and government against those who speak out against these issues means that we'll have less and less awareness with the majority of the nation - who are, unfortunately, less active voters. 

Speaking of the majority of the nation - let's be realistic, how many people here are actually equal under the law in America today? Half of the human population is female, anywhere between 10-20% of people are gay, over a third of the country is ""lower middle class"" or poorer, a third is Black/Asian/Hispanic/etc., 20% has a disability with half of those being extremely debilitating... 

In other words, much more than half of our country - an overwhelming majority, really - probably has some sort of institutional/societal bias against them. It can be as small as prejudice in the streets, to an obvious job bias that you can't prove on paper, to the amount you make versus someone else of the same job, to being investigated on a city street just for looking suspicious. 

You can't focus on elephants stomping around in the room when a guy's coming after you with a knife. In other words, a lot of people would rather fight for direct change than focus on things beyond their reach. Cutting stem cell research funding? Well, what about the school funding that just got cut? Giving secret assistance to extremist groups? What about the fact that my own country won't let me marry? And forget NSA spying, when I can't walk down the street without a cop pulling me aside and patting me down. (Note: these do not necessarily apply to the author) Many people have no time nor energy nor accessibility anymore to be so politically knowledgeable as those who view these as ""non-issues"" seem to. 

With that said, as we widen our demographic spectrum, we also widen our government's viewpoints. As it stands, like I said, Congress has a majority of people of one specific background - rich, old, white men. Not that all of Congress is, but it's a significant number. Most were brought up with similar viewpoints, most likely. However, as we broaden the number of people with different views from the norm, we can also bring new viewpoints to so-called ""larger issues."" People with different experiences obviously bring different opinions to the table. To promote such an agenda would create a much healthier government.  

At the end of it all, the lack of caring by the privileged and political towards those below them may be beneficial to themselves. Corporations are growing, Congress's salary is growing, and at the same time, we, the everyday citizens, by the power of their oppression, lack our own power to have a say in much of anything. If we can't have a voice in how we are treated by our own government and society, will we ever have a voice of power for the things that concern the longevity of other fields of our country? 

To ignore these non-issues - which, by the way, are often combated against by liberals - means to ignore the basic welfare of our people. You don't have to agree with them, although that would be nice; it's just not in the best nature to shrug these things off as unimportant. It's a disgusting display of (dare I say it?) ignorant privilege to do so. 

**We cannot focus on the politics of the country as a whole unless the whole of our country is looked after.** 

Again, this is not that there aren't other issues that should be looked at. What I'm saying is that, unfortunately, our country is in such a state of turmoil that we can't just push aside the aforementioned types of issues that are so often discussed in politics.

media bias,politicaldiscussion,Why can't the people of the United States of America impeach their current leader?,"Before Reddit begins to attempt this question, I want to tell you about myself to give you a background of who I am and slight insight of what I stand for. I am a very forward person. Sometimes I come off as rude and/or arrogant which I will try my hardest to not portrait. I consider myself well educated. I am a student (where and what major is irrelevant ). I'm 25 years old and understand a lot of things the average 20-something year olds don't. I am one of THE most unbiased opinions because I love having the ability to juxtapose all sides of an argument. I know that knowledge is the most powerful tool a person can have against anything. Education can solve many problems and I'm not talking about the ones in my country (USA) but ones across the globe. 
I have a couple of friends whom studied at NYU to become Economists. I have to say talking to them is an uphill battle that is destined for massive migraines and a weeks worth of animosity so I decided to askreddit because is no such thing as answer that can be contained to a 3 minute conversation. I would say I am not a person whom actively talks about politics. In fact, my friends never include me because they understand my distaste for opinionated arguments. I'm an extremely factual type of person. The truth is so much easier to use then bending what isn't... I worry about the things my government has dabbled in the recent years under of our current administration. There is consistent name calling and finger pointing and this is not how the biggest superpower and most resilient country in the entire world should be ran. The accumulated greed and corruption are truly crippling this country's own infrastructure. I have this feeling that deep down I won't be living in a country that provide for its own people in many ways that many other governments won't/don't in many other countries around the world. We (the people) are so lucky and blessed to live in a country like America. We have so many opportunities at our fingertips but I feel like they are slowly but surely becoming extinct. I am scared to create (potential) children/family that won't have the very same amount of opportunities I have (currently). It would not be fair to them. That being said: I want to ask reddit based on my thought process. I'm a very outside the box kind of thinker. I like to do things in completely different than the normal.

I know there is a lot of media bias but at the end of the day Snowden is a real person exposing something real and potentially dangerous.

I'm sick of hearing about NSAs issue of spying on its own people but to me, it is deeper than that. I want to understand the reason behind these heinous actions. My first thought was that maybe there is a huge security potential that the American people are blindingly unaware of (Haha laugh, but it could be true). And my second reason was that maybe the government exploiting the security of every one, digitally, can help to strengthen where the american people are the weakest. The more I think about this the more it could just be plausible.

That is just one issue that has me the most bugged out of many of others I can touch on but this would start to look like a book.

Why is it that the Obama administration points fingers and blames others for letting these issues happen under their administer? How does that reflect in a professional sense? To have a boss whom blames others for making mistakes when it was his/her fault for hiring these people in the first place... Shouldn't a true leader confess up to his/her mistakes and realize that it isn't all about them, that greed an corruption is crippling the very infrastructure the country was built upon. A real leader of this country would expose any corruption to allow the country to thrive  prosper in growth and expansion.

I understand at some point some one has to get dirty and take a hit but shouldn't we all be willing to do that very same? There are plenty of necessary evils in running a government but that is purely so we don't get caught up being opinionated and ignorant of being educated from right and wrong - I get that, but when there is too much of one side its as bad as not being educated (right from wrong). I am generalizing a bit too much but I want reddit to understand my point. (And I do apologize for poor grammar and all other mistakes I make while writing this).

For those of you whom believe this is a matter of race, take moment to think deeper and far more intellectual. Racism is a issue of intelligence, or lack there of. So if you have nothing to contribute of a matter true espionage from our current ""leader.""  Obama is still our current leader and he deserves the respect for being just that, so please refrain from being disrespectful.

I really hope Reddit can educate me beyond what I am asking. I can't wait to read your answers. And thank you for the Redditors whom contribute to this question. Please, if this needs to be posted under another sub-reddit, let me know and I'll adjust immediately.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1hhw0d/why_cant_the_people_of_the_united_states_of/,1372773557.0,1hhw0d
media bias,politicaldiscussion,Why we need to stop talking about abortion and gun control,"I get the impression that the things that we are preoccupied with in political discussion, that is: gun control, taxes, budgets, abortion, gay marriage,etc etc are all kind of irrelevant in the light of some other issues. These transient issues are just symptoms of broader social issues that I will here list:

There is a serious lack of critical thinking in our society. Everyone assumes that because politicians and talking heads on TV say that these things are serious issues that they are serious issues. But think about what these politicians and talking heads are really trying to do! Politicians want to get reelected, so they convince people that the shit they talk about matters and should serve as a basis for voting for them, meanwhile when they're in office they pass laws that seriously restrict people's freedoms and increase government control over our lives by, for example allowing extra judicial killings, enforcing the PATRIOT act which allows unwarranted searches and wiretaps and allow undeclared wars to happen all over the world.

People don't really understand the political system. I get the impression that a lot of people don't get how the system of checks and balances and the separation of powers works, nor do they understand the philosophical argument for democracy. America is not just about democracy and freedom, its about a certain kind of political system that ensures a stable relationship between opposing interests. 

People don't read books anymore. Who here has read the federalist papers? You should do that. Sure, its a long-winded argument that may not make complete sense, but its the basis of the political system that you depend on for liberty, so you should understand it. Next time you want to spend an hour watching TV, read one of the federalist papers instead.

Don't assume that the media or experts are telling the truth or are right about what they say. ""new studies show that blah blah blah""... before you lend a claim any credibility, read the fucking study! What were their methods, how did they reach the conclusion, did they have biases? THINK CRITICALLY. That's all I can say. 

Finally, no one actually listens to the other side of an argument in political discussion. Bill O'reilly sits down with Richard Dawkins and they yell at each other but no one listens. They should try to understand what the other is saying. They should ask their opponent: ""why do you think that?"" and then listen all the way through. But the trouble is, no one in public debates is really trying to can get to the truth, to find the right way of doing things so that we can improve our lives, instead they're trying to advance their own agenda, which is to convince as much of the population as possible that they are right. And why? so they can have power! So they can tell you who to vote for so that the laws get passed that let them get the things they want. Don't fall for that. 

People should listen to the other side's arguments, and that can happen on the individual level. When you hear someone say something you think is crazy, ask them why they think it and listen, then poke holes in their theory, by asking questions like ""but what if fetuses really do experience pain when they're aborted?"" and see if it their answer makes sense. Don't interrupt them half way through speaking by screaming ABORTION IS MURDER! If their theory makes sens, then accept it for the time being until someone else come along with a new crazy theory and listen to that one. Eventually you get a more comprehensive view of the world, and you get to the truth, instead of an ego-flattering yelling match where the loudest wins and feels better about himself but no progress is made.

Finally, if the political discussion is too depressing, people shouldn't just give up and watch cartoons or look at lolcats. You have to believe in your own power, and to do that you have to face the things that make you uncomfortable, until finally your fears are less scary and you can actually make a difference.

After people address these broader issues within themselves, they can look at the more transient issues and make informed decisions and enact real change.

media bias,politicaldiscussion,"Paper I wrote in an ethics type class this semester about the Unethical Aspect of Negative Campaigning, including the 2012 election.  Figured I'd share!  (Includes citations)","Mudslinging, or negative campaigning, is a political ad hominem technique that is used more often than positive campaigning.  In the recent 2012 Presidential election, the Republican super PAC ""Restore Our Future"" spent 62% of $142,645,946 on specifically attacking President Barack Obama (The New York Times).  I believe negative campaigning is unethical because of the motives of the campaign staff, and although it is a controversial technique it has persisted throughout history.  The election of 2012, although not the first to use negative campaigning, has been characterized as the most negative campaign in the history of the United States.  

Negative campaigning is a shining light onto the freedom of speech in the United States.  It fully enforces our rights as citizens to express our personal feelings and views protected by the first amendment.  It is often used in political campaigning in the form of advertisements used to bring negative aspects of opposing candidates into light of the public.  It is the job of the campaign staff to advertise and do their best to get their candidate elected into office.  Ethics are the moral principles that govern a person’s or group’s behaviour.  Negative campaigning is seen by most as being unethical in nature because it presents lies and false characterizations of the opposing candidates.  The candidate could step in and stop the staff from creating these negative ads but as history has shown, they work.  Because ethics are often controversial in nature, it is difficult if not impossible to legally take action against unethical actions.  Although there are codes of ethics that public figures must follow, when a group of people are acting against the ethics put forth, it turns into opinion versus opinion and one person can’t tell the other that their opinion isn’t the right one.  

Negative campaigning was first seen during the presidential election of 1828 when John Quincy Adams ran against Andrew Jackson.  One of Adams’ supporters, Charles Hammond, decided to attempt to destroy Jackson’s character by presenting the people with negative claims about Jackson’s family and personal life.  This act carried on throughout the later elections because people realized how much of an impact it had on the election.  Until technology advanced, sign, posters, billboard, and pamphlets were the primary means of negative advertisements.  In 1936, negative campaigning caught up with technology and the first negative ad was aired across the radio by the Republican Party.  Once television had made it’s way into the homes of millions, the Presidential election of 1964 was met with the infamous “Daisy ad” used by Lyndon B. Johnson against Barry Goldwater.  This ad only aired once on television but is considered to be the greatest factor contributing to Johnson’s enormous victory over Goldwater as well as an important turning point in political advertising history (Wall Street Journal).  The advertisement starts out with a young female standing in a field of flowers picking and counting petals while birds sing in the background.  The young girl is counting and upon reaching 9, a male voice takes over and begins counting down while the camera zooms into the girl’s eye and once the screen goes black, it is replaced by a nuclear explosion while Johnson talks in the background about the stakes at hand and to get out and vote.  All of this was amidst the cold war and people throughout the United States were feared for their lives by the (as it seemed at the time) impending doom of a nuclear war.  

The election of 2012 which showcased Barack Obama against Mitt Romney has been noted as the most negative campaign in history.  “Candidates discovered this year that they'd pay no penalty for campaign lies, distortions and deceptions. Because that's what people want to hear — as long as it's about politicians we love to hate.” (Naples News) Of the ads this year, President Barack Obama’s ads were 86% negative and Mitt Romney’s ads were 79% negative.  This is due in part to the voters not looking for credible sources when reviewing advertisements.  People live in a technology driven world where they want the information now, however it’s served.  This allows the campaign staff and supporters to present biased information and because people choose to blindly accept it the people that create the ads understand they can get away with it.  Corporations are allowed to pay into super PACs to run ads and contribute to the campaign trail and those corporations that donate millions of dollars want nothing more than to see their candidate win the election.  They will formulate lies and present them as fact simply to gain votes by people who “turn a blind eye” to politics.

In closing, over $370,000,000 from only the top 10 independent contributors went directly to attacking the opposing candidate.  Keeping in mind this is only from the top 10 independent donors, nearly 2 billion dollars was donated to the combined parties during the 2012 election.  No amount of money had been donated on that scale before let alone with such a great percent towards negative ads.  Although it has persisted throughout history, the only way to combat this negative advertising is through public awareness.  Voters need to take a larger part in the election and before “sharing or liking” a page on a social media website, they need to spend the 5-10 minutes crediting the facts and sources.  If people can learn to spot the purposeful lies, they can better themselves with knowledge when it comes time to vote for the next president.

Hello ______,
 
My name is _____ and I have recently been redistricted into the eastern edge of the _st district. I am sitting here filling out my ballot and have been researching your positions. I really like what you have to say except that I cannot find much information on your positions regarding the role of our military and the state of our military engagements overseas. While I am a strongly conservative person, I do not agree with many Republicans on those positions and was hoping to get some clarification from you before I vote. Specifically, I fear sending someone to Congress who does not respect and understand the role of the legislative branch in the realm of foreign affairs. I and many other Americans believe that over the last decade (and going back much further), the legislative branch has allowed their power to erode into the executive branch. I cannot in good conscience vote for you if I do not get some clarification in that regards. We stand at a moment when our Republic and our Constitution need defenders. As a young American, I hope that people like you will see that desparate need and step up so that freedom and liberty regain their central role in our society.
 
 I assume that you are very busy with the election right around the corner, but if you had a moment to write a quick summary, I would appreciate it very much. Thanks _____ and good luck on the 6th. Hope to hear back soon.

923 Executive Orders in 40 Months
During my lifetime,  All Presidents have issued Executive Orders, for reasons
that vary, some more than others.
When a President issued as many as 30  Ex. Orders during a term in Office, 
people thought there was something Amiss. 
     
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT  923  EX. ORDERS IN ONE PART OF ONE TERM
??????  YES,  THERE IS A REASON.
IT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS DETERMINED TO TAKE CONTROL AWAY FROM THE HOUSE AND
THE SENATE.
Even some Democrats in the House have turned on him, plus a very small number of
Democrat Senators question him.
HE SHOULD BE QUESTIONED.    WHAT IS HE REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH    ????
DOES THIS SCARE YOU AS MUCH AS IT DOES ME?
________________________________
Not really surprising that he appointed ""Czars"" to be in charge of everything.
Emperor Obama ?
Coming soon to a neighborhood near you.
....THIS IS NOT FUNNY, AND IF YOU VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN, YOU CAN EXPECT MORE!
Remember what he told Russia 's Putin: ""I'll be more flexible after I'm re-elected"".
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION: Obama has signed 923 Executive Orders in 40 months!
What did Congress do in those 40 months? (The House - considerable. The Senate
-nothing, not even a budget nor allowing any House bill to be considered.) A
whole new order must prevail in Wash. DC as a result of this next election! Now
look at these:
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of
transportation and control of highways and seaports.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the
communication media.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power,
gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 allows the government to take over all food resources and
farms.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work
brigades under government supervision.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 allows the government to take over all health, education
and welfare functions.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 designates the registration of all persons. Postmaster General to
operate a national registration 
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to
take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate
communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be
abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 allows the government to take over railroads, inland
waterways and public storage facilities.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to federal
departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued
over a fifteen year period.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency
Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in
times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce
the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to
establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate
penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.
-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to
develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and
distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money
in U.S. financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also
provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress
cannot review the action for six months. 
Feel free to verify the ""executive orders"" at will... and these are just the
major ones I'm sure you've all heard the tale of the ""Frog in the Pot""... you
all comfortable???
Watch Obama's actions, not his words! By his actions he will show you where
America is headed. 
Sounds to me like he is superceeding the Constitution of the USA… But, yet I did not find any provision in the US Constitution for such Executive Orders.
. Just this week, Obama has issued a new executive order that seeks to
""harmonize"" U.S. economic regulations with the rest of the world. This new
executive order is yet another incremental step that is pushing us closer to a
North American Union and a one world economic system.
Unfortunately, most Americans have absolutely no idea what is happening.
The American people need to understand that Barack Obama is constantly looking
for ways to integrate the United States more deeply with the rest of the world.
The globalization of the world economy has accelerated under Obama, and this
latest executive order represents a fundamental change in U.S. economic policy.
Now federal regulators will be required to ""harmonize"" their work with the
international community.
THIS IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE?? 
THEN PROVE TO YOURSELF IT'S WRONG. 
WAKE UP PEOPLE OF AMERICA

I am far, far from an Obama supporter, but I don't think you should be basing policy on misleading and demonstrably false chain e-mails. A search on google fails to turn up a single piece of evidence to support the assertion that Obama has issued over 900 executive orders. If you know of one I would like to see it. The search does, however, provide many reputable sources which refute it. Even right-wing pundits use a MUCH lower number (about 130 which is less than Bush in his first term) to try to scare the public. I agree that Obama has continued the slide away from a balance of power. I agree that the use of executive orders is abhorrent and unconstitutional in all but a few situations which do not have a legislative component. However, to treat Obama as an outlier in that pattern serves to reinforce the disregard and disdain Washington seems to have developed for the Constitution.
 
Furthermore, to say that you will support strengthening the military to its full potential sounds good rhetorically, but I was hoping for more specific ideas. Do you support the use of the military for humanitarian efforts, liberating oppressed peoples, and nation building? I thank your husband for his military service. However, how will that experience translate into policy? If I take the statement that you will strengthen the military to its FULL potential at face value it is a truly terrifying prospect. That would involve drafts, giant social and economic regulations, massive deficit spending, and a disregard for the liberties of Americans amongst other horrible outcomes. We are not supposed to be a military dictatorship. What principles would you use to guide and constrain your votes regarding the military?
 
 If we decrease our freedom in order to strengthen our military, then we have sacrificed the ideals of our founders, the memory of those who died in previous wars, and the hope of western civilization. That is the road we are on. I beg you to be strong if you are elected to Congress. Choose freedom and liberty before the military. Sometimes our greatest enemies are amongst us and they are often the most dangerous. I hope to hear back,

No Nation building, etc.
I believe Executive Orders are seizing Unconstitutional Powers.
Maybe you can nor find the exact numbers, I wanted you to think about the priorities.
Maybe too much information.
Our Military is for protecting America and it's citizens!


E-mail #5:

______,

I believe that you just dodged every point I raised. Maybe you do have a great future as a politician! It was a very manageable amount of information. Check out this website: http://www.factcheck.org/2012/09/obamas-executive-orders/ I am usually skeptical about fact checking websites. They often have a liberal bias. However, that information is so easily dismissed that I feel I have to say something out of good conscience. Just research any one of those orders and you will see the mistake. Not a single one you are brandishing to scare me were signed by Obama. Several of them were signed by Republican Presidents, in fact. Most of them were during the Cold War if I am not mistaken. If I am mistaken, please point me towards information which will show me why. I do agree that it is troubling that the Executive branch and the Federal government generally has assumed such immense and dictatorial power. However, I am troubled that someone who may very shortly be in Congress does not see how the disingenuous nature of that information endangers us further. Rather than seeing the danger as systemic and bipartisan which the limited information it rests upon suggests, the e-mail tries to use valid fears of totalitarianism to achieve a very short term political end of winning this single election by demonizing the president. Based on his record and political philosophy, defeating him with the truth should have been an easy task. I would very much like to hear your response to these concerns. Political discussion and discourse between representatives and their constituents is key to the survival of our republican system of governance. Thanks again,

Fuck you, Republicans in Congress for your absolute non-cooperation with the President. You failed.

And a big fuck you to the media for not being more vigilant about this stuff because you are scared of being called biased by dipshit assholes like Bill O'Reilly.

media bias,politicaldiscussion,My first attempt at r/politics. (PS: I'm Canadian),"I'd originally intended to share this privately with a few of my friends south of the border via facebook, but I thought I'd see just how much abuse and criticism it got here so I could ""touch it up"".

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20008687

Dear American Friends,
So far I've kept my nose out of any American Election posts. So here's my two cents before you all run off to poke holes in paper, or however you do it down there.
First of all, the world is watching nervously while you decide between what I'm sure to many of you is a ""puppet on the left, or puppet on the right"" kind of decision. And to a degree, you're right. 
There are certain things that your vote won't change for the rest of the world. Both both candidates' military plans are probably more boisterous and elaborate than any of us foreigners can imagine. With respect to Drone Strikes, the War on Drugs and Israel-Palesteine, their actions will most likely follow much more similar and uncontroversial courses than their platforms and past performances suggest. 
In terms of corporate lobbying, for the more left-leaning critics out there, it's the same story.

Nonetheless, the link I've posted below shows that there's a disparity, somewhere, somehow, between your perspective and ours. This can be tacked onto problems with international media coverage, a Liberal or Conservative bias in American coverage (whichever way you see it), or simply a false idea among those of us in the rest of the world as to how the U.S.A. really works. 
But for a minute, consider giving the rest of the world some credit.

For instance, here in Canada, where Mitt would most likely be organizing parish bake sales instead of staging a multi-billion dollar campaign, we realize something about these two candidates - and to be honest it does have a lot to do with ""religiosity"". As a semi-closeted religious person I'm reluctant to say that our insight into Mitt Romney's potential for crazy is based entirely on his faith, and I truly think it's something more than that. There are mormons in the world whose thoughts are in no way dangerous, and their faith should be respected and at times revered. But in a country like the United States, where the violent are armed with more weapons, the righteous are armed with more followers and the zealous are armed with more wealth, Romney's power will be magnified, ten fold. Here's a clip that shows why that's so discomforting: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxMD02zU9SE

In a country like Canada, that hovers around the 40% mark in the ""No religious affiliation"" category in the most recent censuses, we aren't used to being concerned about the denomination of our leaders. Recently this hasn't been the case, as our own watered-down Romney - Stephen Harper - belongs to a church whose views are, believe it or not, more ""out there"" than the Church of Latter Day Saints. In any case, Stephen Harper does not hold the same office as the man who once had the keys to the doomsday device. His influence on economic and property law does not spark world-wide recessions. Most importantly, harper's decisions influenced by religion will not prolong an apartheid, cause global setbacks in women's rights or take away state-funded privileges and rights from some couples based on their sexual orientation. No This is because for Canadians, no matter how badly our head of state and the 39% of us who voted for his party try, there is a line and there are boundaries, and that is why except for a few exceptions (the pipeline being the most recent), nothing really happens here. Americans, you need to remember that for you, there is no line, and that in your country everything does and will happen.

So please listen to those countries more stable, more reasonable and more sane than yours. The result of this election will have a huge effect on a large majority of the nations on earth, not because the USA is the greatest or most prosperous country on earth; it's the most powerful, and for the rest of us, that's a scary thought.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/12lbsq/my_first_attempt_at_rpolitics_ps_im_canadian/,1351992669.0,12lbsq
based,CapitalismVSocialism,The kibbutz: a case study in the failure of collectivism,"This is going to be a bit of an effort post. I don't claim to be an expert of kibbutzim, as I'm not Jewish and have never been to Israel. However, I feel more informed than most on this sub to talk about it, having recently read through parts of 3 books on the topic:  

 * The Mystery of the Kibbutz by Ran Abramitzky  

 * The Communal Experience of the Kibbutz by Joseph Raphael Blasi  

 * The Kibbutz: Awakening from Utopia by Daniel Gavron  

The reason kibbutzim fascinates me is because they represent the most earnest, promising, and documented attempt at a collectivist society I can think of. Here, you have a highly motivated and religious community receiving generous government subsidies that numbers a thousand members at most, all agreeing to pool income, eat, drink, sleep, and even parent communally. In other words, if we could design an experimental society to really test the feasibility of socialist ideals, it would look something like a kibbutz. Not only that, we have mountains of data, interviews, and studies that trace the progression of these communities from conception to disintegration. As we'll soon see, the dream did not last. What lessons can the failure of the kibbutzim teach us about socialism in general?  

**What are kibbutzim?**

Kibbutzim (plural of kibbutz) is derived from the Hebrew word *kvutzah*, meaning group. They are small Israeli communities typically between 100 - 1000 members. The first one, Degania, was founded in 1909 on the basis of Zionist and utopian principles, but nowadays the ~100,000 members living in ~250 kibbutzim represent all shades of religiosity, secularism, Marxism, and liberalism. 

Collectivism is the name of the game. Here is how life is run at Kibbutz Vitak (a made-up name by Blasi for anonymity): All major decisions were made at a general meeting of the members, held every week or two. At these meetings, people elected a secretariat made up of a secretary, treasurer, work coordinator, farm manager, and others. They served for two or three years. Members also chose committees to handle things like work, housing, security, education, culture, vacations, and personal issues. The secretariat managed daily life, while the committees worked on bigger, long-term plans that were brought back to the general meeting for approval. The kibbutz was owned by everyone together, and each person had a responsibility to the group. The community, its services, and its work all functioned as one system. Every member was provided with housing, furniture, food, clothing, health care, cultural activities, and schooling for their children. In return, members were expected to work in jobs assigned by the work coordinator. Each kibbutz had shared spaces like a dining hall, cultural center, library, offices, and children’s houses. Most had basketball courts and swimming pools, and some also had tennis courts, ball fields, or concert halls. The houses were surrounded by gardens, with no traffic in the living areas. Workshops, garages, and factories were built off to the side.

**What happened?**

Though many kibbutzim still persist today, they have not been the successful collectivist projects its founders had envisioned. Most of them liberalized, privatized, sought outside investment to stay afloat, or continue to live on in as a kibbutz in name only.

The 3 books I cited represent a good range of opinions on kibbutzim: Gavron is the most critical of the utopian project, Blasi is more hopeful, and Abramitzky is somewhere in the middle if not a bit rueful of their failure. However, all 3 of them cite the same ascribe the slow decline of kibbutzim to the same constellation of symptoms:

Freeloading. Cheap labor. Inequality. Dishonesty. Apathy. Sexism. Brain drain. Cheaper outside goods.

*Freeloading*  
For example, in a survey of what behaviors kibbutz members find the most objectionable, the number one answer at 66% answering ""yes"" was freeloading. People who do not work well or skip hours. Gavron quotes on of the interviewees summarizing this view:

> ""To be frank with you, I don't think it will solve our main problem of motivation,"" he says. ""The ones who will get a bit more money are the holders of the responsible positions, such as the secretary, treasurer, farm manager, factory manager. In my opinion, they accept these tasks because of their personalities and possibly also for the prestige and power they entail. The extra money is not going to make much difference to them. The problem here, and in all kibbutzim, is the weaker members, who don't contribute enough. How do we get them to work harder?""

*Cheap labor*  
As it quickly became obvious that freeloading and expensive internal labor was wrecking many kibbutzim from the inside. Wage workers were eventually brought in from the outside to help with tasks such as building and farming. However, this introduced a problem because now ""expensive"" kibbutzim workers were being replaced by ""cheap"" outside workers, leading to distrust and destabilization. 

*Dishonesty and inequality*  
Economic inequality and dishonesty were the next 2 at 43% and 44%, respectively. But wait, how can there be economic inequality if everyone is sharing income communally? Well, that was the ideal in the beginning but gradually as that generation died, the next generation rebelled. Here's a passage from *Communal Experience*:

> Members disapprove of persons who get money from the outside and of dishonesty equally. Getting money from the outside is, as one member put it, “an accepted social sin. We know about it and turn our heads.” In the days of the intimate commune all money and gifts were handed in, no matter what the source or what the size (a dress or a book was fair game for the collective till). It is now acceptable to receive small gifts, but some members abuse this situation. It was very difficult to collect accurate information in this area, for most members do not even talk to one another about these so-called little sins. This information is based on interviews, gossip, and interviews with several community administrators who knew a good deal about the personal affairs of members. Most members have received a television set, radio, small baking stove, air conditioner, or tape recorder from relatives in Europe, the United States, or even Israel. These items are not extravagant, but they can cause others to use their sources to get the same thing, and may prompt a serious discussion in the general assembly of the direction of the standard of living.

Here we begin to see the fundamental tension between personal and communal property. 

Economic inequality naturally arises even in the most controlled collectivist society. Some people simply work harder and get richer. In the interviews that comprised several hundred hours of conversation, it was the most persistent concern raised in terms of the amount of time and the degree of concern voiced by members of all ages and both sexes.  A few years ago a special committee was set up to examine the situation. Its report suggested that the community purchase television sets, cameras, stereos, and other small luxury items for members who lacked them, and that policy has been put into practice. What is important is not the amount of inequality but the intense feelings and problems caused by whatever small amounts there are. 

*Apathy*  
Apathy was also a huge issue. The founding generation of kibbutz members was filled with idealist zeal, inherently motivated to contribute to the common good, and didn’t require economic incentives in order to work hard and stay. In contrast, later generation members were born into the kibbutz, rather than actively deciding to join it, and they didn’t share the same level of idealism as their parents. They left to attend universities, they worked outside more often, they owned more private property. Eventually by the 1980s, many kibbutzim were speculating on the stock market and taking out gigantic loans from Israeli banks. 

*Sexism*  
I won't go too much into this, but Gavron has an entire chapter dedicated to the miserable existence of women within the kibbutzim. The vitiation of the child-parent relationship in favor of a child-community model also did a number on the children living in kibbutzim. No hugging or kissing or warmth. Simply routine and discipline by the nurse. The girls were especially affected, as many described their sense of femininity, motherhood, and female self-expression get completely trampled.  

*Brain drain*  
As the world became more and more industrialized, the payoff for having valuable, in-demand skills increased. It made less and less sensed for the most able and hardworking kibbutz members to remain in the community when they could simply leave for the outside world and make a much better living. And they did. Abramitzky observes the following:

> As ideology declined, practical considerations took over, and members became more likely to shirk and to leave. In short, as kibbutz members stopped believing in kibbutz ideals, the economic problems of free-riding, adverse selection, and brain drain became more severe. This ideological decline weakened the egalitarian kibbutzim and set the ground for fundamental changes in the kibbutz way of life.

*Cheaper outside goods*  
This is a fascinating one. Blasi posits how as long as public goods were expensive, collectivist approaches worked well. For example, when TVs were first available for purchase, they were extremely expensive and kibbutzim had advantages over outside communities because they readily pooled their money to purchase one for the community. However, as they became cheaper and cheaper, the typical Israeli family could buy one for themselves. Now they had the advantage of being able to watch whatever they wanted whenever they wanted, whereas many kibbutzim were stuck using the community TV. Some compromised and bought multiple TVs for the community, but this fractured communal gathering as share of public goods consumption declined. 

**What are the lessons to take away?**

To the socialists on this sub: it's worth looking at the kibbutz project and the reasons why they largely failed. Think about how you would deal with the tension of freeloading vs. providing welfare for all, the tension between free movement vs. outside capitalist countries bringing in cheap workers. Think about how you would deal with subsequent generations abandoning your socialist project. Ponder how you would deal with economic pressures from capitalist competitors knocking at your door. 

These are all critiques that capitalists have brought up before, and I ask that you don't hand wave these issues away when we have real world evidence that these things eat away at communal bonds from the inside out. 

I end with this quote from Gavron:

> ...kibbutz ideologues and educators openly proclaimed their intention of creating a ""new human being,"" a person liberated from the bourgeois values of personal ambition and materialism. For seventy years, the kibbutz as an institution exerted unprecedented influence over its members. No totalitarian regime ever exercised such absolute control over its citizens as the free, voluntary, democratic kibbutz exercised over its members. Israel Oz was right in pointing out that it organized every facet of their lives: their accommodations, their work, their health, their leisure, their culture, their food, their clothing, their vacations, their hobbies, and-above all-the education and upbringing of their children. Despite these optimal conditions, Bussel's prediction was wrong. The ""comrades who grew up in the new environment of the kvutza"" were not imbued with communal and egalitarian values.",23,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1ntty1f/the_kibbutz_a_case_study_in_the_failure_of/,1759179672.0,1ntty1f
based,CapitalismVSocialism,What Happens When Government Is Absent?,"Here are two case studies for right-wing small government types:

https://newrepublic.com/article/159662/libertarian-walks-into-bear-book-review-free-town-project

In 2004, the Free Town Project took over Grafton, New Hampshire; perfectly legally, of course, the town had about 400 residents and they got 800 like-minded Libertarians to move in, so they immediately won elections for mayor and city council. The first thing they did was cut taxes and slash spending, including selling off the locking trash cans and replacing them with standard urban-style cans.

Then the bears showed up.

These were no ordinary people, though, these were Libertarians with all of the common sense and intellect in the world, surely they could solve the Bear Problem? They called a town meeting and hired a bear expert to come in and educate them on how to separate out food waste from trash to keep the bears away... but it turns out that some of the new residents *LIKED* the bears and were feeding them intentionally and didn't see any reason at all why they should stop *and how dare you try to trample on their freedom by telling them that they couldn't!*

The Bear Problem wasn't the only issue; Grafton quickly became a haven for sex offenders and fugitives, the ""small government"" Libertarians turned out to have a strong litigious streak and quickly flooded the municipal court system, and a town that had gone almost 250 years without a single murder had several within a decade.

The Grafton Free Town Project ended in 2016.

The second example is less well documented:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Mountain_(Alabama)

The Wikipedia article is pretty sanitized, as no one likes to talk about the reality of the situation.

Sand Mountain, Alabama is the most densely populated rural area on Earth. 100,000 people in ~1,000 mi^2 on top of a finger of the Cumberland Plateau, and nothing but a handful of incorporated communities in terms of government.

Until fairly recently, it was a Sundown Town, except it wasn't a town; nevertheless, ""Don't let the sun go down on you here, n~gger,"" signs were posted at each road up the plateau. These are snake-handling ultra-conservative folk with bibles in their pockets and assault rifles in their trucks. Even the Feds don't go up there except in large numbers, and then pretty much only to grab fugitives from justice, assuming they can find them.

I suppose that sounds OK to a certain flavor of right-wing Libertarian, but the area is also desperately poor and uneducated. The soil is sandy and acidic, fine for root vegetables and herbs, but commercial agriculture is out of the question. There is no industry. There is no higher education. One community on the edge of the area is well-known for outlet shops; that is literally the largest source of legal income for the entire population.

Capitalism is based on the fundamentally flawed premise that human beings are rational actors, and this is the proof.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1ntsnkn/what_happens_when_government_is_absent/,1759176753.0,1ntsnkn
based,CapitalismVSocialism,Capitalism and democracy require certain technological prerequisites in order to thrive,"Preface: this is more of a feedback-gathering exercise than anything else. I'm not strongly invested in this position and could be easily convinced out of it. I also don't think I'm writing anything new. Someone in the comments might tell me, ""you idiot, x wrote about this at length, just go read his stuff"", in which case go ahead and make some recommendations.

Feudalism doesn't exist without the advent of *agriculture*. Could you imagine trying to enforce feudal relationships with nomadic hunter-gatherers? No -- if you tried to collect crops from them, they'd just go ""wtf"" and move away. Agriculture is a prerequisite for feudalism. Why? Because agriculture leads to sedentism. Once people stop moving around, the concept of land as private property naturally begins to emerge. People cannot relocate as easily and the decision between paying crops or moving away suddenly becomes stacked in favor of staying still, and so feudal relations are easier to enforce.

What about capitalism (as we know it, which is concerned primarily with commodity production)? It's not controversial to say that *industrialization* is one of the key prerequisites. By industrializing, societies shift away from agrarian-based to manufacturing and service-based economies. Whereas it once took 8 peasants to feed 10 people, now it only takes 4. What happens to the other 4 people whose labor is freed up? They move to cities where now there's suddenly a large pool of labor to work in factories. The *printing press* was another key invention that enabled capitalism, which allows better recordkeeping to track who owns what and who owes whom. *Ocean faring technology* were important to scale up markets from local to regional to global. I'm sure there are many others.

Democracy? Yes, democracy too, even though it's not an economic mode of production. I'd think democracy thrives when people are close together either in proximity or in contact (through telegram, telephone, internet, etc). The reason is that greater population density leads to more opportunities for interpersonal conflict. Settling these conflicts required arbiters and courts of law (every large scale democracy had courts of law in place but not the other way around), but how the laws were created required a mechanism that satisfied the populace. Hence, democracy. Ancient Athens was able to achieve this, and their trick was that they were a small, urbanized city-state. As *industrialization* and *urbanization* increased over time, democracy became more and more logical to implement as average population density rose. It also seems that democracy thrives under stable geopolitical conditions. The Roman Republic was the big dog in the Mediterranean and could afford to run a republic; of course, this gradually degraded as the geopolitical situation crumbled and Rome transitioned into an Empire. Another true representative democracy wouldn't take shape until England in the 17th century and then the United States in the 18th century. It's not a coincidence that both of these nation-states were industrialized, geographically isolated regional powers who could flex on their neighbors. The message is this: democracy is fragile and only seems to work well in urbanized societies in times of stability. Once that stability is taken away, nation states have a tendency to default back into authoritarianism. This is highly applicable to the state of the world today.

This brings up the most interesting question: what are the prerequisites for socialism? Some will say AGI. Maybe? Chips in the brain that allows you to connect to all other human beings to develop a universal sense of empathy? I don't know, but what I do know is that that technology (if it does exist) isn't here yet. The reason why attempts at socialism have fallen flat on their faces is the same reason why attempting feudalism before agriculture or capitalism before industrialization would be doomed to fail: the material conditions need to be there first, if that's even achievable. 

I recognize this sounds awfully like Marx's concept of historical materialism, which I acknowledge. Unfortunately he goes way too shallow into the technological aspect, which I think deserves much greater emphasis. It's also strange that Marx would've laid down his theory of historical materialism with pretty some astute observations and yet gotten communism completely wrong.",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1nh8i7w/capitalism_and_democracy_require_certain/,1757898858.0,1nh8i7w
based,CapitalismVSocialism,Why the Economic Calculation Problem lives up to its name (serious post),"Here's a TLDR since it seems to be highly requested:

The main argument is that:

1. The economic calculation problem argument only applies to centralised systems of economic planning and ignores the democratic decentralised variations.
2. It assumes that markets are always at optimal efficiency no matter what and ignores the various aspects of pricing that make most prices distorted and not actually reflective of real supply and demand of resources.
3. It assumes that socialists haven't attempted to solve or address the issue of the lack of data and information in the past, which they have, through things such as Project Cybersyn. Paul Cockshott's also written a lot on that subject.
4. Markets often create the very problems of excessive bureaucracy and administration that they are purportedly there to solve and prevent, and bureaucracy is not exclusively a problem of excessive government control or regulation.
5. It ignores the nuances and intricacies of the different methods and models of planning and markets that exist beyond the simple ""planning versus free market"" binary and assumes a false dichotomy between state control and private property without considering the third model of cooperative ownership by the workers themselves (which did not, in fact exist in Cuba, USSR, etc).
6. Due to the necessary state control over sectors like money creation, policing, and the military to maintain the capitalist system by giving its social relations like private property real backing and force behind them, no capitalist economy can be considered entirely a free market economy.
7. Due to the black markets, commodity production, and wage labour that existed and served as the economic backbone in some cases in past renditions of what I will refer to as state capitalism (Cuba, USSR, pre-Deng PRC, etc. you know the list) they can't be considered as 100% planned economies either.

Okay, another post edit. Since people want me to put some examples of democratic and decentralised economic planning systems I will provide some:

Plus I literally already provided a description from Guerin on the system of a federation of workers' councils lol.

Daniel Guerin was a [real person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Guérin) if you think I'm making him up.

Another edit: I added paragraph breaks because apparently I need to cover my ass left right and centre according to you rowdy lot (no offence intended).

The economic calculation problem is a criticism often levelled against socialism and the prospect of economic planning as being a viable alternative to the ""free market"" economy. The story goes like this. People in favour of planning (be that a decentralised or centralised system) argue that directly allocating resources without currency or commodity production would be more efficient at meeting peoples' needs and serving social utility. The proponents of this economic theory then argue that due to a lack of pricing signals based on supply and demand that the market supposedly provides that the people actually doing the planned (it is assumed to be a minority of central planners and state bureaucrats in nearly all cases).

Most modern capitalist economies would be more accurately described as mixed economies, and in fact, all incorporate some level of economic planning due to the tendencies towards monopolies and the necessity for certain key sectors such as policing, arms manufacturing, and infrastructure to be either tightly regulated or nationalised outright as these sectors provide essential services and legal backing to economic relations that capitalism must maintain to survive. I mean, you don't know who owns things like land, factories, stocks, or whatever without a standardised set of rules and standards for proof of ownership, and the state has both the authority in principle and in practice to enforce it through control over the usage of violence, a monopoly on currency to facilitate a change in ownership, and standards for the format of the necessary title deeds and proof of ownership. In the same breadth, there are multiple renditions of socialism, most notably, market socialism, that blend levels of state control with markets and currency to achieve purportedly socialist ends, so assuming that the argument is simply between a binary of ""total state control"" and ""total free markets"" when the reality is that even the most highly centralised command economies still relied on the sale of goods and services to consumers (people in the soviet union and pre-Dengist PRC weren't just given free food handouts, that simply wasn't true for the entirety of its existence, and this took place both in the legal planned economy and the illegal black market that existed as well). Meanwhile, there are other systems that effectively abolished traditional currency entirely in favour of labour vouchers, and some attempts at socialism have even opted to oppose centralised planning by the state in favour of workers' self-management and federated democratic councils to conduct central planning.

The economic calculation argument often tries to avoid this complex nuance that comes with a discussion of whether planning is viable or not, and reduces the definition of planning to basically only highly centralised authoritarian examples of it, puts very little effort into understanding the method of planning in of itself, and often assumes a perfectly rational pricing mechanism within a market ignoring factors such as price negotiability, perks and discounts, price gouging and artificial inflation, all of which, even under a perfect base price, still have a wider distorting effect on the macroeconomy. It also assumes that economic planning means a really shitty yet ridiculously large bureaucracy that has to approve approvals that are approving approvals to get stuff done, and very little levels of data collection or understanding of peoples' needs. Basically, it assumes that a market is always operating at equilibrium or at optimal efficiency, and that a planned economy is always operating in a backwards, sluggish manner with no room for improvement, which, yes I accept was the case for many past command economies but there have been other cases that involve little to no bureaucracy, or even an actual state or monopoly on violence for that matter. TLDR: most people that cite the argument assume too much and don't really make any effort to ask other questions outside of the assumed bubble of economics that they understand to be a straight up yes or no question, and most people don't really understand the issue at hand and assume that there's no possible solution to the problem in the first place.

So, with my initial rant out of the way about the assumptions those that often use the argument make, let's delve into the nitty gritty about what this critique is really about.

The broader argument for this critique of inefficiency is primarily about information, knowledge, and statistics. It assumes that markets provide this information indirectly on an individual basis to the consumer and that their evaluation of individual costs to themselves allows them to make usage of resources which would otherwise be used in an inefficient manner, and that without a monetary pricing mechanism, planners cannot compare the input and output stages of production and would therefore end up using too much (overproducing) or too little (underproducing), leading to ridiculous levels of surplus that lead to wasted resources in the long run, or shortages meaning very little can access they stuff they want/need. However, it fails to acknowledge that lack of information about peoples' needs and wants has in fact occurred much more frequently under capitalism than under socialist systems historically, and that overproduction is very much a systemic issue of capitalism and a major contributor to climate change. The market can also in fact distort peoples' needs and wants psychologically through advertising etc although this has also been addressed through behavioural economics, and places a number of artificial barriers towards rational allocation. Usage of resources is measured in terms of spending, not actual physical amounts or raw output, meaning that it is assumed that an enterprise making billions is seemingly economically efficient whilst in the background they could be doing things like creating artificial shortages to drive up demand and prices, deliberately slowing down or massively increasing production, or doing things that on paper seem to be economically ridiculous decisions. Does it really make rational sense for private water companies in the UK, for example, to be dumping sewage in the rivers, taking on historically massive amounts of debt just to pay dividends, and acting in a rather irresponsible manner towards their customers.

Market logic dictates that they should experience massive losses, have their operations suspended, and have millions of customers desert them, yet, due to intrinsic physical factors in the landscape and the fact that the water sector, due to how capital-intensive it is and how water sources are physically limited, can't really exist as a competitive sector and so everyone is beholden to water with literal shit in it because of that. People often argue about the universality of market logic, yet there are many sectors in which it simply can't and won't work no matter how much deregulation and government-stepping-back you do, and in fact privatisation and relaxation of the rules has allowed the companies to get away with such irresponsible behaviour. Meanwhile, if there were some sort of direct democratic accountability, where all people with an interest in the water system (which is, of course, literally everyone) would have basically voted to clean up the fucking mess and there's an obvious incentive here: the engineers that work in the water system don't shit falling out of the taps into their bathtub when they get home after a long day! It's not bloody rocket science. Let's take another example where bureaucratic inefficiencies have in fact been a problem created by market dynamics, which is housing. Firstly, it need not be said that the demand for housing is mathematically easy to tell. Based on simply the amount of population and the age of the population, we can very easily tell how many homes there needs to be. Plus, under an ideal socialist system, there would be no proof of identity or signatures to give, because housing would be literally just given to you as a universal entitlement. Plus, very little information needs to be tracked except current occupancy and usage, and that can easily be done in a way that protects peoples' privacy. In fact, we already in many countries register peoples' primary residence for taxation, postal services, etc, and literally all you need is a table with a few columns for address, location, and the names of occupants.

We don't even need modern computers or technology for it, we've been doing it on paper for more than a century with little to no issues! Under capitalism currently, when you want to buy a house (unless you're minted enough to buy something outright), you will likely want to apply for a mortgage. When you do, you have to: provide proof of identity, give loads of numbers, codes, etc for your bank info, have a good credit score (which means you have to have a proven history of good money and debt management which can be quite hard, and in many cases the way it's calculated and your actual records are highly obscured by banking apps and services so you don't even know exactly what you need to do and just have to guess based on vibes), have to read and sign a bunch of paperwork, T&Cs, and that's just to even prove your entitlement to housing. And afterwards is also a real ass-ache. Real administrators and bureaucrats have to keep track of peoples' mortgage debt obligations, which means tracking payments and when they were paid, at what time, calculate how much interest someone owes, guess how long until they pay back, etc etc. All of this soaks up energy that could be better put towards heating peoples' homes and powering assistive technology, it uses paper that could be put towards making beautiful drawings and sketches, and it uses buildings that could (ironically) be renovated and converted into homes and houses, but instead it's used to trap people in debt and engage in unproductive rent-seeking for no empirically logical reason other than for bankers to rake it in. When compared with the surprisingly simple socialist solution of just giving it to someone, we realise that in fact markets create the very inefficiencies they purportedly exist to prevent. And guess what, we don't need money or pricing mechanisms to figure out how many bricks or material is needed to build a house, because we already have builders, planners, and architects that have been doing this sort of thing for generations and we can look at already existing housing to know how to build and arrange things! All we need to know is how much resources and labour there is, which it seems to me there is loads because as we speak loads of buildings and housing is being built, in fact in many ways there's too many physical houses and apartments if we look at how much unused property is soaked up by landlords making a profit out of artifically restricting access to a service (they most likely did not involve themselves in making the blueprint or building the house, therefore not involved in the provision of housing, and are apparently oh so nice for giving you access in exchange for what in some cases amounts to extortion, in my opinion).

Another thing that must be addressed is how socialists have attempted to combat this arguably real problem that can and will happen without a proper system to share and manage information and keep it up-to-date and (if possible) updated in real time. The technology obviously exists to do this and the process can and should be automated, with calculations made as transparent as possible and flag any inefficiencies and correct them as soon as possible. This preserves accountability and also stops greedy bureaucrats trying to inflate figures to get a raise in their salary, which was a very serious source of corruption in the Soviet Union, for example. This is of course well documented and proven to be true and I won't waste my energy arguing with tankies on this issue. Central planning is largely inefficient and the planning I would support would be decentralised as the few times it has existed it has proven to make things a lot more efficient and better for everyone involved. Heavy computerisation also allows things such as electronic voting from home and other things which makes democratic participation in the economy easy to access for everyone that has a vested interest in involving themselves in such decisions, whilst making delegates and positions either automatically rotating or instantly recallable preserves direct democracy and prevents a minority from assuming total power over all economic decisions for 5 years because they got voted in once. This idea isn't even knew, this kind of computerised networking existed through Project Cybersyn in Chile years before the internet became a thing. A dictatorship is still a dictatorship, even if the ruler just so happens to change every 5 years lol. Anyways, what attempts have socialists tried to address and remedy this problem?

I will now hand you over to Daniel Guerin, a revolutionary socialist, who wrote a pretty good explanation of this federated council-based system of decentralised, participatory economics based on the system that existed in Revolutionary Catalonia:

>*The socialized factories (In revolutionary Catalonia) were led by a management committee with between five and thirteen members, representing the various services, elected by the workers in a general assembly, with a two- year term, half of them to be renewed every year. The committee selected a director to whom it delegated all or part of its powers. In the key factories the selection of the director had to be approved by the regulatory body. In addition, a government inspector was placed on every management committee. The management committee could be revoked either by the general assembly or by a general council of the branch of industry (composed of four representatives of the management committees, eight from the workers' unions, and four technicians named by the regulatory body). This general council planned the work and deter- mined the distribution of profits. Its decisions were legally binding.*

The Soviet Union for the overwhelming majority of its existence (excluding the few months before the first constitution of the RSFSR) had a different system of one-man management, which effectively empowered one person to make all decisions. The factory committees were appointed bureaucrats by higher central authorities, and there was very little democratic accountability, and very little ability to raise concerns. In the capitalist workplace in many instances, excluding some small examples of more participatory ownership models like the Mondragon Corporation, the boss has supreme authority, either because of their appointment by the owner, or because they are the owner. A reminder that private ownership exists solely as an ideological principle with ideological justifications - I've yet to encounter a rational explanation of why it's a good thing beyond simply going ""muh individual rights"" lol, forgetting that in many cases private ownership can restrict other people's individual rights so it's not really a good argument. Meanwhile, there are literal biological justifications that justify needs-based allocation of goods and demonstrate how mutual aid and sharing responsibility and risk equally have helped animals to survive and evolve. And what's the best way of ensuring a system is responsive to the people's needs and desires? Giving everyone an equal say on decisions in relation to it, also known as ✨democracy✨.

based,CapitalismVSocialism,"I like to think that I know well, maybe I'm wrong. Would like to get a discussion going about why capitalism isn't meant for the common folk. Please be polite. and look inwards at your own nation and criticize what you feel is wrong in your country. If you could please? And so will I, my nation.","Simple answer from all these american migrant videos that describe how life is different for them outside the US, answer being... Capitalism is ruining survivablity for common wage earning folks. I see this in India as well. Largely capitalist our nations, and we are told since we start speaking as children that we have to strive to have a legacy, make the family name proud! Though our concept of this legacy is deeply rooted in family, so family comes first no matter how cruel your parents might be to you. We never leave them unless the person leaving is extremely selfish or has reached a breaking point. Though we have some welfare programs that do work for the poor and financially limited, it's still largely capitalist agenda that helps serve the rich over the poor. I mean we are known in the world for our rampant poverty, and mostly it gets upscaled by poor working class and extremely cheap laborers that lack the education to control their conception ability. Hence we crossed China in world population. And that's also a topic of discussion in our country, that making more people without proper family planning is ruining a lot of things for us. Contrary argument from the opposition is always we need more people to strengthen our country because we have more people. 

Which tbh is such a weak argument to present in front of educated masses. But the uneducated buy into this and produce more children that end up on the street, joining gangs and robbing people at knife point. And I'm not blaming these kids for doing this, for them it's survival. It's unfortunate that their lives could never take off. And I believe same shit happens in US, homeless tend to be reckless due to lack of resources that support them.And the opposition always answers with why can't they just get a job and improve their lives? That's what I like to call typical capitalist apathy. They don't care as long as they remain rich and fed, and have a legacy of kids that follow their footsteps or share their same values. I know a few americans that have cut off their parents from their lives because of being forced into certain beliefs. tbh I would to, but I'm lucky to have parents who are open minded. They might believe in Hinduism, but they stopped forcing me once I told them my logical reasoning behind why religion is kind of a dated ideal. They still believe, because they are set in their ways. But I wasn't forced in a position to distance myself from my family because they seem to understand. And most people aren't as lucky as me to have understanding parents. Most of our country's youth is forced into ideals. Since they are younger blood, they tend to be more extremist in their beliefs because their parents crammed it in their heads that the outside world hates us and wants us to fail. Which can be true, but it's not always the case. 

Though we have division in our country similar to US when it comes to the core beliefs in politics and religion, we still function better in a social norm because we are densely packed as a population. A riot everyday would destroy our work hard mentality of the middle and lower class citizen. For people like us we can't afford to riot, because our jobs are what feed us, that's the biggest problem with capitalism in the first place. It's locks the citizens in a state where they are trapped, either they get fired, work until they die or retire while taken advantage of by the higher up executives that keep incrementing bonuses on their salaries. It's such a broken system. I'm not even in favor of communism. But a legit democracy should care about it's citizens, we do here, but not as much as we should. 

It's still a rarity if an employer is ever kind to their employees. Socialist democracy is the way to go, where the politicians serve the country instead of their own personal interests. If a politician in screaming the mic that our country is the best and we shall make it better, that politician is lying in my eyes. For they don't want glory for the country, it's the agenda behind them, funded by billionaires who want the citizens to believe the candidate. A real politician that cares will address the issues instead of hyping up a mixed crowd of educated and the less educated alike, the difference is that tends to divide the populous that perceives this address as either a point of pride, or a point of deeper understanding of geopolitics that explains why certain moves are made to benefit only parts of the country. Best example for any developed country is military. The amount of money spent on military explains their distrust in the world, and their ability to rationalize acts of war based on propaganda and blaming others for self created problems. 

In summary, we are all the same, we might speak different tongues, but the human mentality is the same regardless of culture or skin color. Every nation has faced dictator rule throughout their history, everyone has had slavery in the past, we are not as different as the politicians make us seem to be, for that is agenda. They have irrational fears about others overstepping boundaries and taking what's theirs. When in reality most common people just want to live a decent happy life.

We all are children of the earth, same flesh and blood with unique differences. Please be kind is all I can ask, you can criticize me, but you don't have to use harsh language, tbh I just want to know the problems in other nations.

based,CapitalismVSocialism,The United States Was The First Socialist Country; We Seized The Means Of Production In 1787,"The [Northwest Ordinance of 1787](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance) is the basis for property law in the United States (as well as most other modern states, which wound up copying the idea); by seizing land and distributing grants of rights to individual settlers, it set the precedent of [Collective Sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state#Ontological_status_of_the_state) and the [Bundle of Rights theory of property law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_of_rights).

This concept was then enshrined in the [Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Emoluments_Clause):

>*No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.*

In the context of the era, a, ""[Title of Nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility#Noble_privileges),"" literally meant an hereditary title associated with an estate; that is, a land-owner. The [Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Takings_Clause), for example, is based on ultimate ownership of land residing with the state.

The specific division of public and private property rights varies somewhat by location, but generally, private property rights include tenancy, let, sale, and heritance, while public property rights include taxation, police power, escheat, and eminent domain. Water, mineral, and agricultural/industrial/commercial rights vary by state and municipality; in Alaska, for example, [all oil rights are held publicly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund). [Water rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_law_in_the_United_States) are even more complicated.

The obvious question to ask is, ""Why didn't Marx talk about this?""

Notably, Marx did write about the US, mostly during (and about) the Civil War, and Abraham Lincoln spoke highly of him, but the US was still a relative backwater in terms of international prestige (the Civil War and subsequent treatment of freed slaves not doing us any favors in that regard), and the only other nation which had experimented with this kind of collective sovereignty was France, which, if anything, was an even bigger disaster than the US during Marx' lifetime.

The larger cause, though, was that it clearly had not solved the problem; wealth inequality in late 19th-century America was grotesque in the extreme. However ""public"" our property rights might technically be, our political system has been locked up from the beginning... and neither Marx nor anyone else has come up with a solution for that problem, under any system, Socialist, Capitalist, or otherwise.

Or, perhaps, the elite's hold on the political process simply has not failed, yet, and we are simply waiting on a united popular front to finally use the property rights we have always had, but were told we could not employ by the private interests getting rich off of them.

We just need enough people to decide that nationalizing extractive industry across the US to fund basic necessities like food, housing, healthcare, and education is more important than talking about what people are doing with their groin hardware.

There are more important things; I will not trade our basic rights and freedoms such as speech, religion, press, guns, privacy, etc, but most anything else we can sort out after the fact.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1n7ifzq/the_united_states_was_the_first_socialist_country/,1756914522.0,1n7ifzq
based,CapitalismVSocialism,Piero Sraffa On The Use Of The Notion Of Surplus Value,"[Alessandro Roncaglia](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/finally-an-economist-takes-on-the-topic-of-power) has Piero Sraffa, along with John Maynard Keynes, as the greatest economist of the twentieth century. He wrote very little. He spanked Hayek very hard.

Lately, a couple of pro-capitalists here pretend to be interested in Sraffa's attitude to Marx. His attitude was quite positive, especially after 1940. This attitude is not that transparent from his 1960 [book](https://www.nuevatribuna.es/media/nuevatribuna/files/2013/04/15/production_of_commodities_by_means_of_commodities.pdf).

Sraffa, in his archives in the 1940s and 1950s, is quite appreciative of Karl Marx's analysis of capitalism. This appreciation contrasts with the opinion embodied in the label 'neo-Ricardian', which Bob Rowthorn [invented](https://newleftreview.org/issues/i86/articles/bob-rowthorn-neo-classicism-neo-ricardianism-and-marxism.pdf).

I have previously documented Sraffa explaining how labor [differs](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1mtmyxz/comment/n9ide5b/) from other [commodities](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1mtmyxz/comment/n9d0uwg/). I have quoted a definition of labor values from an [appendix](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1mx3s4o/what_are_labor_values/) to Sraffa's book. This post presents another passage from Sraffa's archives.

I know about the passages below in the Sraffa archives from [Riccardo Bellofiore](https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/36/6/1385/1683253). The archivist, Jonathan Smith, has dated this entry from 1955-1959, late in the writing of *Production of Commodities*.

I do not want to focus on whether Marx or Sraffa are correct or not. I would want to work out a simple example. Besides, Sraffa seems not convinced of how to analyze the reduction in the working day, when starting at prices.

But I want to note that Sraffa is very much using Marxist concepts: vulgar economics, labor values, prices of production, surplus value, exploitation, and rates of exploitation. And the analysis is based on Marx. Surplus value comes from extending the working day past the point at which workers reproduce their labor power.

>""**Use of the Notion of Surplus Value**

>""The prolongation of the working day beyond the point at which the labourer would have produced just an equivalent for the value of his labour-power ..."" (Cap., Engels transl. p. 518) cp p. 539 \[Chapter Sixteen: Absolute and Relative Surplus-Value\]

>Put it the other way round. If starting from capitalist society the working day is shortened till there is no surplus value left, this shortening must be equal for all: if it is, the prices of the commodities will change \[owing to change in the rate of profits, which vanishes\], but the wages will remain unchanged : if it is not, and the working day is reduced to the extent of the profits made in each industry, then prices would remain unchanged\* after the shortening \[for the number of (shorter) labor days, in industries having a high organic composition of capital, would increase in the same proportion as the fall of profits\] but wages would be different.

>\[Footnote:\] \*(28.12.41) But profits would be different (after the reduction) in different industries!

>\[Marginal note:\] c/p Letters of M and E 129-32 (letter of M. 2.8.62)

>In other words, if we start from profits (as vulgar economy does) we reach the conclusion that the rate of exploitation is different in different industries, being higher in the more highly capitalised ones – which is not \[and indeed contrary to\] the fact. If we start from surplus value, which is equal in all industries, we get the correct measure of exploitation. The former conclusion is patent nonsense, and no view of exploitation could be based on it.

>Note that the former (profits) goes with a theory of prices, the latter, of value (as defined below).

>12.11.40 \[Price is an exchange ratio which equalises rates of profit on capitals. Value is an exchange ratio which equalises rates of surplus-value on labour. If commodities exchanged at their values, profits would be different for different capitals, and capitals would move: therefore, this competition of capitals causes them to exchange at their prices.

>The question is: are the rates of exploitation different? and if so why doesn’t labor move, and restore values and equality of rates of surplus value?\] ..."" -- Piero Sraffa [D3.12.46/57r – 63r](https://mss-cat.trin.cam.ac.uk/manuscripts/uv/view.php?n=Sraffa.D3.12.46#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=74&xywh=-1912%2C-168%2C6186%2C3306)

Sraffa goes on for a couple of pages, some reconsidering how to analyze the shortening of the working day.

Nothing like the above is in Sraffa's book. Connections to Marx are less apparent, although some reviewers perceived them. [Counterfactual reasoning](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3217460) is mostly eschewed. The length of the working day is not discussed, but taken as given.

Sraffa does not seem very confident about whether he should start with value or prices and how he should proceed if he adopts the latter. He does see the importance of what was later called price Wicksell effects. He ends the extract from the archives that I am considering with this:

>\[N.B. The fact that the value of capital (and therefore its ""quantity"" or magnitude) varies with the rate of profits (and generally cannot be known without knowing prices and rate of profits) makes nonsense of many cornerstones: 1) ""Sacrifice of waiting"", but how if they don’t know what they are abstaining from? 2) rate of interest, or marg. prod. of cap., as criterion for distribution of resources; but how, if the same resource (in ""value"") becomes larger or smaller (in ""price"") according as it used in one way or another?

>5.1.42 Those who regard Marx's transition from values to prices, by the necessity of equalising the rate of profit, as a trick, should say the same of Ricardo's (and the whole marginal school) method of determining cost of production by considering only that on the marginal land, by the necessity of equalising the price of all bushels of corn, on whichever land they may be procured. Cannan does so (Rev. of Ec. Theory, p. 178): Ricardo did the trick by little more than an arbitrary exercise of the right to define terms ...""  -- Piero Sraffa

By the way, Ian Steedman has a chapter towards the end of [*Marx after Sraffa*](https://www.versobooks.com/products/1058-marx-after-sraffa?srsltid=AfmBOoqW9n33k-zrYXRG9tWcImPWGVGCrONh6Sswuly0-Fw8QYe3nEGq) illustrating the analysis of the length of the working day. Consistent with his general approach, he uses data on physical quantity flows and does not take the point at which prices are values and labor is not exploited as a reference point.

So one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century took Marx's analysis seriously. This has only become more well-known in the last few decades.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1mzpdvw/piero_sraffa_on_the_use_of_the_notion_of_surplus/,1756125653.0,1mzpdvw

Rather than Italy, France, Korea, Germany, Spain, Japan and Indian each making their handful of 200 million dollar budget superhero movies every single year, America, through Hollywood produces them and dubs them for foreign audiences. That way, all of humanity can watch them without having to produce them. Not only does this lower the amount of money humanity spends producing superhero movies, it actually allows them to exist because of the return from global box offices. If each country only had their own box office to rely on, then the special effects of modern blockbusters would simply be unfeasible simply because of the lack of a financial return.

Now, if you apply this concept to things like technology, you understand why it makes more sense for a giant American tech company like Alphabet, which employs tens of thousands of engineers to produce and maintain services like Google, YouTube, Android, Gmail, Maps and the like, rather than each country trying to build their own version of Alphabet. It costs Alphabet tens of billions dollars a year to provide the quality that they do, regardless of the size of the user base. Not every country can pull this off. What os socialism's answer?

Considering the cost barrier of building and maintaining these services and the inability of other nations to mobilize the resources necessary to build them, if a company Meta were owned and operated by the US federal government, how would foreign users of WhatsApp (billions of people) be certain that the US government would not arbitrarily disable access to the service during trade disputes or to exert political pressure? It would be a very difficult thing for the US government to order a private company like Meta to disable WhatsApp access to India due to a trade dispute, but the government routinely engages in such behavior with regard to tariffs.

**To the principled defender of capitalism:** You hold your beliefs not out of malice or ignorance, but from a commitment to a worldview you find to be the most logical, productive, and conducive to human freedom. You believe in the power of the individual, the integrity of voluntary exchange, and the rational allocation of resources through the market. This document does not ask you to abandon those values. Instead, it asks you to test them against a deductive argument that begins from premises you yourself would accept as self-evident.

What follows is not a political manifesto filled with rhetoric, but an attempt at a formal proof. It is structured as a series of granular, numbered axioms, proceeding from the most basic observable facts of human existence to the complex conclusions of libertarian Marxism. The methodology is deliberately rigid. Each new axiom is built directly upon the foundations of those that came before it, with explicit citations to show the chain of reasoning. The intent is to create a logical structure so tightly woven that it cannot be dismissed in its totality, but must be refuted at a specific, identifiable link.

**The challenge presented to you is one of pure logical critique.** Your task is to read this sequence and find the point at which the logic fails. To successfully refute this argument, you must identify the first axiom that is either:

a) Factually incorrect in its observation of the world.

b) A non sequitur, a conclusion that does not logically follow from the preceding axioms it cites.

It is not sufficient to disagree with the final conclusion on its face. If you find the conclusion unpalatable, you are intellectually bound to trace the argument back to its source and pinpoint the precise location where reason gave way to error. If you cannot find such a flaw (if every step, however small, proves to be sound) you are then faced with the more difficult task of reconciling your existing beliefs with a conclusion that follows logically from a shared starting point.

The foundation of any robust ideology is its ability to withstand rigorous scrutiny. Here is the gauntlet.

* This is a direct, empirical observation of biology. The law of conservation of energy applies to human bodies. We observe that without sustenance, humans perish. This is the most basic, irrefutable starting point.

**Axiom 2: Consumption requires production.** The resources necessary for survival (Axiom 1) do not typically appear in a form ready for immediate consumption. They must be gathered, cultivated, altered, or combined. This process of transforming natural materials into consumable goods is defined as **production**.

* We observe that edible plants must be grown or gathered, animals must be hunted or raised, and raw materials must be fashioned into shelter and clothing. This is a fundamental observation of human history and daily life. Even the simplest act of picking a berry is a form of production (gathering).

**Axiom 3: Production requires labor.** Production (Axiom 2) is not an automatic process. It requires the exertion of human physical and mental effort upon the natural world. This purposeful exertion of energy is defined as **labor**.

* This is a self-evident extension of Axiom 2. To transform nature, an agent of transformation is required. We observe that this agent is the human being, acting purposefully. Fields do not plow themselves, houses do not build themselves.

**Axiom 4: Labor is mediated by tools (the means of production).** Human labor (Axiom 3) is almost always performed using instruments that enhance its effectiveness. These range from the most basic (a sharpened stone, a stick) to the most complex (a factory, a supercomputer). The set of non-human objects used in production (Axiom 2) are defined as the **means of production**.

* Archaeology, anthropology, and contemporary observation confirm this. Human history is defined by the development of its tools (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Information Age). We observe that productivity is a function not only of labor time but also of the sophistication of the tools used.

**Axiom 5: Production is fundamentally social.** Humans rarely, if ever, produce (Axiom 2) in complete isolation. They cooperate, divide tasks, and share knowledge, making production a collective, social activity. The methods and relationships through which a society organizes its production are defined as the **mode of production**.

* We observe this through history and sociology. Division of labor is present in the earliest known human societies. The complex supply chains of the modern world are an extreme example of this principle. An individual cannot, from scratch, produce a smartphone or even a simple pencil. This requires a vast network of cooperating labor.

**Part II: The Emergence of Class Division**
-

**Axiom 6: A distinction exists between possession and property.** We must distinguish between two types of ownership:

a)  **Personal possession:** Ownership of goods for direct personal use (e.g., your toothbrush, your clothes, your home that you live in). These are objects of consumption.

b) **Private property:** The legally sanctioned right to exclusively own, control, and dispose of the means of production (Axiom 4), which one may or may not personally use.

* This is a legal and functional distinction. The legal framework of all modern societies differentiates between consumer goods and capital assets. Your ownership of a car for personal transport is functionally and legally different from a corporation's ownership of a fleet of taxis or a factory that manufactures cars. The latter is a source of revenue and command over the labor of others, the former is not.

**Axiom 7: Society can be divided based on relationship to the means of production.** Given the existence of private property in the means of production (Axiom 6), it is logically possible for a society to emerge where one group of people owns the means of production (Axiom 4) while another, larger group does not.

* This is a logical deduction from Axiom 6. If private ownership of productive assets is possible, then it is also possible for that ownership to be concentrated. Empirically, we observe this division in many historical and all contemporary capitalist societies. Forbes' lists of billionaires (owners of vast productive assets) exist alongside census data showing the majority of the population owns negligible productive assets and relies on selling their labor to survive.

**Axiom 8: The emergence of economic classes.** When a division as described in Axiom 7 becomes the dominant organizing principle of a mode of production (Axiom 5), two primary economic classes are formed:

a) **The owning class (bourgeoisie):** Those who own the means of production (Axiom 4) as private property (Axiom 6). Their primary means of acquiring resources for consumption (Axiom 1) is through the profit generated by their property.

b) **The working class (proletariat):** Those who do not own sufficient means of production to sustain themselves. Their primary means of acquiring resources for consumption (Axiom 1) is by selling their capacity to perform labor (Axiom 3) to a member of the owning class in exchange for a wage.

* This is a functional definition derived from Axiom 7. We observe its reality in the structure of our economy. Most people go to ""work"" for a company they do not own. They trade their time and skills for a paycheck. A smaller number of people ""own"" those companies and derive their income from the company's profits, not from a wage for their own direct labor within it. These are not moral categories, but descriptions of an individual's functional relationship to the system of production.

**Part III: The Logic and Dynamics of Capitalism**
-

**Axiom 9: Capital is value in motion seeking to expand.** In the capitalist mode of production, the primary goal of production (Axiom 2) is not the creation of goods for use (use-values), but the creation of profit. This is represented by the circuit M-C-M' (Money → Commodity → More Money). The initial sum of money (M) is **capital**. Its defining characteristic is that it is invested with the sole aim of becoming a larger sum of money (M').

* This is the foundational principle of business and investment, taught in every business school. No rational capitalist invests $1,000,000 in a factory (the C in the middle, composed of Means of Production and Labor) with the goal of getting exactly $1,000,000 back. The goal is always profit (M'). We observe this in quarterly earnings reports, stock market behavior, and all forms of investment.

**Axiom 10: The source of new value is human labor.** The means of production (Axiom 4) — machines, raw materials, buildings — transfer their own value to a new product, but they do not create new value. A machine worth $10,000 that wears out during the production of 1,000 widgets adds $10 of its own value to each widget. It cannot add $11. The only input that can create more value than it costs is human labor (Axiom 3), because the value of a worker's wage can be less than the value of the goods they produce in a given time. This unique commodity is called **labor-power**.

* This is a point of theoretical contention, but it can be deduced logically from Axiom 9. If profit (M'-M) is the goal, there must be a source for this new, added value. It cannot come from nowhere. It cannot come from the raw materials, which are bought at a market price. It cannot come from the machinery, which depreciates. If an owner buys $10 of steel and uses $5 of machine-time to make a product they sell for $30, where did the extra $15 (minus other costs) come from? It must come from the one input that is ""active"" and creative: the worker. The worker is hired for a fixed cost (a wage), but in the time they are working, they can produce a value greater than that cost.

**Axiom 11: The definition of surplus value.** **Surplus value** is the quantitative difference between the new value created by a worker's labor (Axiom 3) during the production process and the value of their own labor-power, which is paid to them as a wage. Profit, rent, and interest are the distributed forms of this surplus value.

* This is a direct logical consequence of Axioms 8, 9, and 10. If a worker is paid $20 for an hour of work, but in that hour they add $50 of value to the products they create, the surplus value is $30. For the owner (Axiom 8) to achieve their goal of M' (Axiom 9), this extraction is not optional, it is a mathematical necessity of the system. We know this happens because businesses that consistently fail to generate revenue greater than their costs (including wages) go bankrupt. That positive difference is, by definition, surplus value.

**Axiom 12: The capitalist imperative: maximize surplus value.** To succeed in a competitive market, each member of the owning class (Axiom 8) is compelled to maximize the surplus value (Axiom 11) extracted from the labor process. This can be done by:

a) Extending the working day.

b) Increasing the intensity of labor (more work in the same time).

c) Reducing the wage paid to the worker.

d) Increasing productivity through technology, thus devaluing the goods the worker needs to live and allowing for lower wages relative to output.

* We observe these behaviors in the history and present of capitalism. The history of the 19th and 20th centuries is filled with struggles over the length of the working day. The modern workplace is characterized by performance metrics, surveillance, and Taylorist ""scientific management"" to increase intensity. Corporations consistently seek to minimize labor costs, either through direct wage suppression or by relocating production to lower-wage regions. The drive for automation (d) is a constant feature of industrial competition.

**Axiom 13: Alienation is a consequence of the capitalist mode of production.** Because workers sell their labor-power (Axiom 10) to an owner, and the production process is oriented towards profit (Axiom 9) rather than human need, a multi-faceted **alienation** occurs. The worker is alienated from:

a) The product of their labor: They do not own or control what they create. It belongs to the owner.

b) The process of labor: The work itself is often dictated, monotonous, and devoid of creativity, controlled by management to maximize efficiency (Axiom 12).

c) Their own human potential: Their creative capacity for free, conscious activity (labor) is reduced to a mere means of survival.

d) Other human beings: The system fosters competition between workers and a fundamental antagonism between the owning class and the working class (Axiom 8).

* This is a psychosocial conclusion based on the preceding axioms. We observe its effects empirically. Workers in assembly lines or call centers report feeling like cogs in a machine (alienation from process and self). The frustration of creating immense wealth for a company while struggling to pay one's own bills is a manifestation of alienation from the product. We observe competition for scarce jobs and the inherent conflict of interest in wage negotiations between labor and management (alienation from others).

___

**Part IV: The Role of the State**
-

**Axiom 14: The state is a set of institutions with a monopoly on legitimate violence.** The **state** is defined as the entity within a given territory (e.g., a nation) that successfully claims the exclusive right to use or authorize the use of physical force. This includes the police, military, courts, and prison system.

* This is the standard definition of the state in political science, famously articulated by Max Weber. We observe that if a private citizen uses force (e.g., kidnapping someone and putting them in a cage), it is a crime. When the state does the same thing (arrest and imprisonment), it is considered legitimate law enforcement.

**Axiom 15: The primary function of the capitalist state is to uphold the capitalist mode of production.** While the state performs many functions, its fundamental, non-negotiable role within a capitalist society is to protect the core axioms of that society, primarily the institution of private property in the means of production (Axiom 6) and the owner-worker class relationship (Axiom 8) that follows from it.

* We observe the state's actions. Contract law, the legal basis of the wage-labor agreement, is enforced by the courts. Police are used to break strikes, evict tenants, and protect corporate assets during unrest. The state may regulate aspects of capitalism, but it does not and cannot challenge the right of an owner to own a factory or the necessity of the population to work for a wage. If a group of workers were to occupy a factory and declare it their own, the state, via the police or military, would intervene to return it to the legal owner. This reveals its core function.

**Axiom 16: The state is not a neutral arbiter netween classes.** Because the state's primary function is to protect the system of private property (Axiom 15), and this system is the very basis of the class division (Axiom 7, 8), the state cannot be neutral. It necessarily acts to preserve the power of the owning class, as their power is synonymous with the rules of the system the state exists to defend.

* This is a logical deduction from Axiom 15. If the state's role is to enforce the rules of a game, it cannot be neutral towards someone attempting to overturn the game board. We also observe this empirically through the immense political influence wielded by corporations and wealthy individuals (lobbying, campaign donations, the ""revolving door"" between industry and government) which ensures that state policy favors the health of capital accumulation (Axiom 9).

___

**Part V: The Libertarian Critique and Synthesis**
-

**Axiom 17: Authoritarian ""socialism"" fails to abolish class division.** A mode of production where the state (Axiom 14) assumes collective ownership of the means of production (i.e., state capitalism or what was termed ""Actually Existing Socialism"" in the 20th century) does not eliminate the fundamental problems. It merely replaces the private owning class (Axiom 8) with a new ruling class: the state bureaucracy or party officials.

* The worker in a Soviet factory still did not own or control their workplace. They were still subject to a wage system, and the surplus value (Axiom 11) of their labor was appropriated by the state planners. The alienation (Axiom 13) of labor remained, as work was still a dictated means to an end, not a form of self-actualization. The relationship was still Worker → Boss (now a state-appointed manager) → Appropriation of Surplus. The class division was reconstituted, not abolished.

**Axiom 18: The state is an instrument of class rule, not a tool for emancipation.** Since the state (Axiom 14) is fundamentally a tool for maintaining class society (Axiom 15, 16), it cannot be wielded to create a classless society. A ""workers' state"" is a contradiction in terms for a libertarian Marxist, as long as a state exists, it will create and defend a new ruling class, as its very structure is based on a division between rulers and ruled.

* This is a core libertarian (or anarchist) axiom, combined with the Marxist analysis. Logically, a tool designed for hierarchical control and violence cannot produce an outcome of non-hierarchical freedom. Historically, we observe that all attempts to use state power to achieve communism have resulted in authoritarianism and the perpetuation of class-like divisions (Axiom 17), confirming that the state apparatus itself imposes its own logic on its users.

**Axiom 19: True emancipation requires the abolition of the state, capital, and wage labor.** The only way to resolve the contradictions inherent in capitalism (alienation, exploitation, crisis) without recreating them in a new form (Axiom 17) is through the simultaneous and coordinated abolition of:

a) Private property in the means of production: Replaced by common ownership and democratic self-management by the producers themselves (e.g., through workers' councils, syndicates, or communes).

b) The state: Replaced by a system of voluntary federation and direct democracy, where administration replaces government.

c) Wage labor: Replaced by free association, where individuals contribute to the social product according to their ability and receive from it according to their needs.

* This is the final synthetic conclusion. It is the only solution that addresses all the problems identified in the preceding axioms. It resolves class division (Axiom 8) by eliminating its basis in private property (Axiom 6). It overcomes alienation (Axiom 13) by returning control of the product and process of labor to the worker. It eliminates the need for surplus value extraction (Axiom 11) by abolishing production for profit (Axiom 9). And it avoids the trap of authoritarianism (Axiom 17) by rejecting the state (Axiom 18) as a tool of liberation. This synthesis (a stateless, classless, moneyless society based on the free association of producers) is the positive expression of libertarian Marxism.

**Axiom 20: Freedom as substantive self-determination.** **True human liberty** cannot be defined merely as the negative freedom from direct, personal coercion (e.g., the freedom to choose which employer to work for). It must be defined as the positive freedom of substantive individual and collective self-determination: the material capacity to direct one's own life and labor, to develop one's full potential, and to participate in shaping one's community on equal footing with all others. This comprehensive liberty is structurally impossible under capitalism.

* This is the final philosophical and ethical conclusion derived from the entire preceding logical chain. We have established that the capitalist mode of production, even under the most ideal conditions, necessitates a fundamental lack of self-determination for the majority. The worker is compelled by economic necessity to sell their labor-power (Axiom 8), surrendering control over their work process and its product (Axiom 13). Their life activity is subordinated to the logic of capital accumulation (Axiom 9, 12), not their own goals. The state, as an institution of class rule (Axiom 16), imposes decisions from above rather than enabling collective governance from below. Therefore, the ""freedom"" offered by capitalism is purely formal and procedural, not substantive and real. It is the freedom to choose one's master, not the freedom from mastery itself. The positive liberty of self-determination can only be realized when its material barriers (wage labor, private ownership of productive means, and the state) are overcome, as outlined in Axiom 19. Freedom, in its most meaningful sense, requires as its prerequisite the social and economic equality which the preceding axioms have shown capitalism systematically negates.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1ml5oaq/a_materialist_deduction_of_freedom/,1754683817.0,1ml5oaq
based,CapitalismVSocialism,Do You Know About This 1900 Split Among Socialists?,"The second international was the major organization for socialist parties around 1900. The first international had collapsed with struggles for leadership between Marx and anarchists. The German Social Democratic Party, headed by Karl Kautsky, seemed to be the most successful socialist party in the second international. After Engels, Kautsky became the literary executor for Marx. He edited and put out volume 4 of *Capital*, that is, *Theories of Surplus Value*.

Eduard Bernstein was Engels' literary executor and therefore a prominent member of the German Social Democratic Party. He had been the editor of *Der Sozialdemokrat*, the party’s newspaper. Perhaps Bernstein was influenced by his acquaintance with members of the Fabian society when he was in exile in London. He looked at the growing wealth of the German workers; the apparent strength of working-class organizations, such as unions; and the SDP representation in the Reichstag. Economic development was not concentrating wealth in a smaller and smaller capitalist class. These trends did not seem to him consistent with the revolution that Marx foresaw. And he said so.

*The Preconditions of Socialism and the Tasks of Social Democracy* (*Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus*) is the major statement of Bernstein’s views, and was published in 1899. It started as articles in *Die Neue Ziet*, the SDP paper for more theoretical work. Bernstein was called a revisionist, which has ever after been a pejorative among more radical socialists. His theses were argued about at the SDP's Stuttgart Conference, held in October 1898.

Bernstein argued for legislation and peaceful reform in favor of the workers. Socialists should be a parliamentary party. They should agitate for universal suffrage. They should leave businesses, for the most part, in private hands. Socialists should support the development of civil society.

Rosa Luxemburg saw an opportunity to raise her stature in the German SDP. She had already participated in the Stuttgart conference. Others, including Kautsky, also argued against Bernstein. Luxemburg's *Reform or Revolution* is a classic statement of the radical, anti-revisionist view. She argued against idealism, against petty bourgeois moralism, and against opportunism. Idealism, in this sense, means basing political views purely on intellectual arguments. Emphasizing universal citizenship loses a working-class standpoint. According to Luxemburg, capitalism will inevitably break down. Socialism is a scientific standpoint, given its historical necessity. I do not know that this is in this pamphlet, but Luxemburg famously said that our choice is socialism or barbarianism.

This controversy was echoed in other countries. In France, Jean Jaures led the reformists. I think of Georges Sorel as an intellectual leader of the revolutionaries. His 1908 book, *Reflections On Violence* does not strike me as particularly Marxist. You maybe should read ‘violence’ in the title as what is today called direct action. Sorel, at the time, was an advocate of syndicalism. He was kind of mystical in his emphasis on non-rational motives for mass movements. Hence, his myth of the general strike.

In Italy, Filippo Turati, a founder of the Italian socialist party (PSI), was a reformist. The radicals were called maximalists. They seem to me more positivist than Marx would ever be. They saw the revolution as inevitable, not something to be brought about by political action in the here-and-now. Socialists should organize and educate, holding themselves back until the revolution comes.

In Russia, the split was between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks. Apparently, these names mean 'the minority' and 'the majority’. Bolsheviks were only the majority because some supporters of the Mensheviks had walked out of the Second Congress of the RSDLP (Russian Social Democratic Labor Party), at which the split occurred. Julius Martov was an important leader of the moderates, while Lenin headed the Bolsheviks. Lenin’s pamphlets, *What is to be done?* (1902) and *Two steps forward, one step back* (1904) are essential primary sources here.

Lenin argued for agitation on all fronts, not just for economic improvements for the workers. He wanted an organization of professional revolutionaries, and developed the idea of democratic centralism. The Bolsheviks should have the freest discussion in deciding on policy and tactics. But once a vote has decided the issue, the comrades follow the party line. The establishment of an all-Russian newspaper is the immediate implementation called for in What is to be done? Is this *Iskra*?

I ought to say something about Austria.

Notice I have said nothing about Sweden, Denmark, Norway, or Finland. Bernstein provided the intellectual structure for what became democratic socialism and social democracy. I do not know historical details about Scandinavia. He said, ""The final goal, no matter what it is, is nothing; the movement is everything.""",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1m9qfka/do_you_know_about_this_1900_split_among_socialists/,1753527295.0,1m9qfka
based,CapitalismVSocialism,"Transitions in economic modes of production occur due to technology, not internal contradictions","Marx's great ""insight"" was that each economic system undergoes a period of formation, function, and decline. This is a rather simplistic view of history, but I do admit that society has clearly progressed in terms of complexity and scale. But by what mechanism? We're told that each phase undergoes decline due to internal contradictions within that system that eventually come to a head, leading to its own destruction and the rise of the next phase of human civilization. I'd argue for a much simpler explanation: technology enables societal change. 

**Primitive communism --> Agrarianism**  

* This was due to the Agricultural Revolution.  
* The key technologies that enabled this transition were: farming, irrigation, damming, domestication, and selective breeding.  
* Humans figured out that they could 10x their food production by settling near rivers, planting, and then harvesting crops for consumption. This was a huge improvement over the previous tribal lifestyle where everyone either hunted or foraged.  
* Primitive communism was around for tens of thousands of years before the transition to sedentary society; there were no ""internal contradictions"" within primitive communism that led to its downfall. Had agriculture not developed, humans would've stayed at this stage indefinitely.  

**Agrarianism/Feudalism --> Proto-Capitalism**

* This was due to further advances in agriculture, seafaring technology and navigation.  
* The key technologies that enabled this transition were: the heavy plow, crop rotation, the compass, advances in ocean-worthy vessels, and glassmaking.  
* Greater crop yield means more food surplus and more artisans, merchants and traders. Advances in navigation means greater range for trade, more opportunities for exchange, and therefore greater incentive for non-agricultural output. It also enabled the age of exploration, colonization, and imperialism.  
* Economies are still dominated by agriculture.  

**Proto-Capitalism --> Industrial Capitalism**

* This was due to the Industrial Revolution.  
* The key technologies that enabled this transition were: the assembly line, the steam engine, the power loom, artificial lighting, and the internal combustion engine.  
* Prior to industrialization, you needed 7 or 8 farmers to grow enough food for 10 people. This means a net surplus of food for 2 or 3 people, who could then specialize and work in the city.  
* After industrialization, you only needed 3 or 4 farmers per 10 people to sustain everyone. This means a lot more people free to do non-agricultural work, mostly commodity production.  
* Economies transition from primarily agrarian to primarily manufacturing for the first time. Of note, this transition also means a plummeting in birthrate, since children become liabilities rather than assets.  

**Industrial Capitalism --> Modern Capitalism**  

I make a distinction between Industrial Capitalism and Modern Capitalism due to the scale and velocity of capital we now have. 

* This was due to the Green Revolution and the Information Revolution.   
* The key technologies that enabled this transition were: mechanized farming, GMOs, the transistor, the internet, and aviation.  
* Now you need just 1 or 2 people per 10 to sustain the entire population. Most of the world now lives in cities.  
* Further advances in transportation and information flow meant speedy trade on a global scale. You can manufacturing a good in China and ship it to the United States for less than the cost it would take to produce something locally. This had never happened before in history, and means markets expand from local to regional to global.  
* Economies transition from manufacturing to service-based.    

**Modern Capitalism --> Socialism (?)**

Marx spells out some of the internal contradictions within capitalism that would lead to this transition, such as the struggle between capital vs. labor, the tendency of rate of profit to fall, and the tension between higher consumption vs. lower pay.  

I am not opposed to the idea that capitalism *could* one day give way to a new mode of production, but it would require a civilization-altering technology, the same way we saw previous transitions led by agriculture. Is AGI that technology? I don't know. But I do know that idea of ""internal contradictions"" leading to a phase transition is at best unnecessary and at worse inaccurate. It is used as the bedrock for Marx's eschatological musings of capitalism's downfall, but it simply doesn't pass historical muster.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1m5jk6q/transitions_in_economic_modes_of_production_occur/,1753106127.0,1m5jk6q
based,CapitalismVSocialism,Imperial Communism,"#Let Us Assume,

The Socialist conception of human history becomes true.

The contradictions of capitalism on Earth become too much to bear, and the world falls under communism. Our human society becomes moneyless, classless, and stateless. The vision of Marx and the socialists is achieved — humanity falls under a system of Global Communism.

*From each according to his ability; to each according to his need.*

The idealized society the socialists have dreamed of becomes reality. There is no coercion, for there is no exploitation. There is no domination, for there is no power. 

There is no state. There is no money. There is no class.

It is the culmination of historical materialism. 

All production is for use, not profit.

Labor is voluntary. Ownership is communal.

The state has withered away.

Technology automates much of labor, and “scarcity” is managed by common planning.

Humanity flourishes, growing in all aspects.

But the resources upon the Earth are finite. Human time, labor, and attention are finite. Furthermore, coordination of these endeavors is also finite.

But Humanity becomes fruitful, and multiplies. A new mission is set upon them, to support their utopia, their paradise, their Heaven on Earth.

Global Communism thus becomes Imperial Communism.

Its primary mission: resource extraction, energy production, and the expansion of living space.

These powerful imperatives drive the expansion of Imperial Communism. The mining of He-3, the colonization of planets, the harvesting of asteroids, the powering of interplanetary logistics.

But who is to undertake these tasks?

Who will volunteer to become a soldier of humanity, to become an agent of expansion of Imperial Communism?

Will we rotate the labor force? Will we incentivize them? Will we rely upon technology?

The volunteers for this labor are sparse. The act of laboring becomes specialized, dangerous, unattractive. Labor becomes coercive, lest the utopia we’ve created grinds to a halt.

Further yet, who will coordinate these volunteers, to direct the soldiers who undertake these harrowing tasks?

The expansion of Imperial Communism requires the coordination of energy, of resources. It requires the prioritization of planetary targets, of colonization efforts. The scheduling of launches and the allocation of fuel must be organized. More distantly, conflict between planetary communities must be resolved.

How shall humanity decide upon these actions? 

Do we hold a democratic vote for the entire world? Do we form councils of technocrats? Do we delegate power to an artificial intelligence, to a supremely intelligent quantum computer?

Decision making begins to centralize.

The stateless society thus evolves de facto command structures. In the act of coordinating the vast array of human intelligence and labor, authority returns, and hierarchy is reintroduced.

The ambitious among us, driven by prestige or mission, take up the task. They seek not wealth but to gain for themselves, to profit off this new directive, this new purpose.

Thus, labor is coordinated under the banner of expansion, under the promise of glory, of the triumph of Imperial Communism over the stars.

So the soldiers of Imperial Communism go forth. They embark upon vessels made to traverse space and time. They land upon Mars, upon asteroids, upon moons, and upon planets beyond our system.

Their project: the sustainment of the commune of Earth.

But not all resources in the vastness of space are equal. Even granting full material abundance on Earth, the cosmos imposes a new contradiction.

Distance. Energy. Time. Coordination. No longer can every person participate in every decision. Not all needs are local. Not all labor is voluntary.

The strategic control of resources re-emerges. 

The colony of Mars sits upon valuable ice and mineral-rich land.

The asteroids hold the key to advanced propulsion technology.

Who shall we entrust to allocate these resources? An AI? A council?

What happens if a colony begins to develop unruliness to Imperial Communism? What if the colony begins to threaten detaching from the Earth commune?

In order to preserve the unity of humanity, to maintain access to the strategic resources required to sustain the Earth commune, their will must be enforced.

Their enforcement now resembles statehood. Now, jurisdictions must be defined. Sanctions and arms of enforcement must be created. Rules governing secession and property control must emerge.

Political coercion reforms, entirely in the absence of capital forces.

Meanwhile, across the culture of Imperial Communism, though class ownership is abolished, a new inequality of function is emerging.

The Transportation Guild of astrophysicists and space logistics officers now hold enormous influence over the direction of Imperial Communism. They decide what colonies flourish, and which colonies must wait.

Deep-space engineers control the systems vital to the Earth commune, forming the Terrestrial Council. Their stewardship of critical infrastructure grants them quiet authority over the lives of billions.

AI maintenance experts create a new priesthood, divining the language of code, known across Imperial Communism as the Computers. Few others can replace their sacred knowledge.

While all property is held in common, new relations of control and authority emerge through expertise, access, and location.

These are not capitalists nor aristocrats — but they are no longer equals.

Thus, a system of class returns, not one of wealth, but of function.

As time goes on, the expansion of Imperial Communism continues. But humanity, once unified, begins to divide, politically and culturally.

Colonies grow distant, developing unique cultures. They grapple with different ecological needs. Their demand for labor differs from the other communes. Even the very vision of “communal life” begins to diverge.

In the absence of the nation-state, space-faring, post-communist humanity fractures. 

Human thought, once united, explores itself.

*Must us Martians still pay tribute to the coordinating bureau of Earth?*

On Titan, calls for experimentation with Private Property arise.

Across the moons of Jupiter, the Jovian orbital inhabitants feel minimized on the project of Venusian terraforming.

The once stateless unity of humanity thus breaks down into post-ideological geopolitics. The withering away of the state is reversed, and reborn not as capitalist resurgence, but as the assertion of sovereignty in the vastness of spatial complexity.

War thus erupts among once united mankind.

The Martians seize Earth.

The Titans fall into civil conflict.

The Jovians declare independence.

Cut off from the systems of abundance, the inhabitants of Imperial Communism begin to feel the weight of limits once thought banished.

Guilds issue urgent priorities. Councils furiously debate quotas.

The illusion shatters.

Abundance is not universal. Abundance is conditional, and those who control the conditions are the ones who rule.

Scarcity, thought vanquished, makes her vindictive return.

In the final stages of Imperial Communism, we might find;

Money re-emerges, a symbolic token of accounting across planetary distances and production units.

Property claims arise over resource bases, life-support systems, and data flows.

Hierarchies of governance are reborn, to mediate disputes or direct interplanetary projects.

Defense and deterrence emerge, as the competing colonies arm themselves against their “non-cooperative” peers.

based,CapitalismVSocialism,My Economic Manifesto To Rival Marxism by Criticizing What Came After.,"The system we live under today isn’t real capitalism; it’s corporatist central planning dressed in a free-market costume. Massive companies like Walmart don’t operate in competitive, decentralized markets; they function like internal planned economies where executives dictate everything from logistics to labor behavior, while workers have zero stake or say. These corporations partner with the state through lobbying, subsidies, and regulatory capture, creating a rigged alliance where policy serves the entrenched few, not the public. Prices aren’t set by open competition but by vertically integrated supply chains controlled at the top. Employees follow strict routines, wear uniforms, and are micromanaged like cogs in a state-run factory. There’s no real ownership, no democratic input, just efficiency and obedience. This isn’t the free market; it’s a hybrid of corporate monopoly and state power, where individual liberty is smothered and freedom is reduced to a branding slogan.

But communism isn't much better. It claims to eliminate class, yet all it does is replace the capitalist elite with a bureaucratic one. The state becomes a single, sprawling corporation where party officials act as the new bourgeoisie, controlling all production and enforcing strict obedience. Workers are stripped of ownership, autonomy, and any real influence. Market choice vanishes, property rights are abolished, and dissent is crushed under the illusion of equality. What’s promised as freedom becomes deeper servitude, with power more centralized, more unaccountable, and more immune to resistance than anything capitalism ever created.

At first, I saw democratic socialism, like in the Scandinavian countries, as the most successful model, offering workers more voice, stability, and dignity. But that image falls apart under scrutiny. Its stability depends on quietly outsourcing its contradictions to the third world. While citizens at home enjoy generous welfare systems, strong labor protections, and high living standards, the engine underneath runs on cheap labor, outsourced manufacturing, and resource extraction abroad. It doesn't eliminate exploitation; it just moves it out of sight. The fairness it advertises is built on a global imbalance, where someone else pays the price for the comfort it claims to provide. It relies on open markets and capitalist trade to sustain its social programs, effectively feeding off the very system it pretends to soften. The result is a sanitized illusion, with ethical consumption, clean streets, and equity for the few, propped up by the quiet suffering of invisible workers in distant factories and mines. Just like the rest of Europe, which is steadily drifting toward the same model, these countries depend on others to sustain their stability. Europe relies on the United States for military defense, allowing it to redirect spending toward domestic programs, and benefits from capitalist-driven medical innovation while pushing the high costs of research onto American consumers. Whether in a third world sweatshop or a struggling American household, someone bleeds for their comfort.

That’s when I saw the real solution: capitalism itself isn’t the enemy, the problem is the separation between labor and ownership. Instead of concentrating control in government bureaucrats or corporate executives, we need to shift power to the people actually doing the work. Democratic socialism highlighted the need to give workers a voice, but it stopped short by relying on the state to speak for them. Whether those workers are in another country or in their own, companies must be held accountable by the people inside them. The solution is distributed control. What I mean by that is mandating capitalist countries to require corporations to pay employees in voting shares instead of traditional wages. These voting shares would still be exchangeable for cash, but they would also give workers direct influence over company decisions. This approach makes workers stakeholders in the systems they sustain, giving them both a voice and a tangible share in the outcomes of their labor. It doesn’t discard capitalism; it restores it to what it was meant to be, a system where freedom, responsibility, and reward are shared.

This system would function like a constitutional republic within a corporation, dividing power between two governing bodies: one elected by traditional shareholders and executives, and the other elected by employees who receive voting shares as part of their compensation; these voting shares would only be granted to full-time employees, ensuring that those with the greatest stake in the company's long-term success also hold the most influence, and shares would be issued gradually based on tenure, role, and contribution level, allowing workers to build influence over time rather than acquiring immediate voting power upon hire; major decisions such as budget allocations, executive appointments, or structural changes would require approval from both chambers, preventing domination by either corporate elites or a worker majority. Voting shares could be weighted by factors like tenure, role, or contribution level to avoid short-term populism while still granting all workers a voice. A corporate charter, similar to a constitution, would outline which decisions require simple versus supermajority votes and establish internal checks, including a neutral ethics board to resolve disputes. To preserve competitiveness, employee voting would be limited to structural and ethical matters, while executives retain control over daily operations, product decisions, and innovation strategy. Time limits would be imposed on votes to prevent gridlock, and a supermajority override would allow decisions to move forward if one chamber is obstructive. Innovation zones could be established where projects operate with temporary autonomy, and international branches could follow adapted models to remain agile abroad. Worker votes would be informed through internal training and strategy briefings to ensure responsible participation, and traditional capitalist incentives like bonuses and stock options would remain in place to retain talent. This structure ensures accountability, protects long-term vision, and balances risk with representation, allowing capitalism to retain its incentives while restoring dignity and influence to labor.

based,CapitalismVSocialism,The Economic Calculation Problem is a Problem for All Economic Calculation,"(I want to begin with a caveat: I am an anarchist and am not an advocate for central planning. Some of you might be tempted to read this as an argument for central planning, but this is actually an argument for thinking about economies as economies and not in terms of an adversarial debate.)

Mises’ argument for the economic calculation problem (ECP) goes something like this:

> Individual subjective values about preferences and opportunity costs are transformed into rational and objective information in the form of prices via market exchanges. The information conveyed by these prices—both in the form of consumer prices and in prices for capital goods—is necessary for efficient and rational economic decisionmaking about the allocation of resources. In the absence of objective information conveyed via prices, decision makers cannot allocate resources rationally and efficiently, but rather arbitrarily and thus inefficiently.

Mises in particular identified the sort of “country-wide central planning by state bureaucrats” that was popularly associated with socialism in his time as suffering from the ECP. Some thinkers extend his argument beyond just bureaucratic central planning to include any system that does not include prices for both consumer goods and services and for capital goods.

However, the ECP is not limited to just these kinds of economies. The ECP applies to *every economy* beyond small-scale and intimate economies, such as individual households or networks of sole proprietors, in which people can be personally familiar with each other’s preferences and in which both technical and entrepreneurial work are performed by the same person. Yes, this includes free market capitalism.

The ECP afflicts even free market capitalism for two broad reasons:

- prices do not perfectly convey objective information, and

- any distance between a decision maker and market prices introduces the bureaucratic principle-agent dilemma to decisionmaking.

Let’s consider three facts about prices that reduce their ability to convey objective information about the economy:

- Prices are not intrinsically natural. That is, some prices might be administered rather than taken from the market. If a firm commands sufficient power in its market, it can set prices and keep them constant in the face of shifting supply and demand, at least within some bounded range. This is why, when you shop from most firms, you take the price they have administer rather than bargaining with the cashier until you have each taken a price from the market. Absent natural prices, any given price imperfectly conveys information about preferences.

- Prices cannot convey equilibria. Firms can know the price of a good or service they are selling, and they can know the quantity they have sold, but they cannot derive from these data a demand curve. Absent a demand curve, firms cannot determine which price, if any, represents an equilibrium price. Without knowledge of an equilibrium price, any given price imperfectly conveys information about preferences. 

- Prices are influenced by wealth rather than simply preferences. A person with more money than someone else can broadcast their preferences to the market via their spending in disproportion to their individual capacity to consume. This might accurately convey information about the preferences of wealthy individuals, but it distorts information about aggregate demand. While this might allow a firm to rationally maximize its profits, it can inhibit the overall economy’s ability to rationally allocate resources to meet a society’s material needs. An economy that efficiently produces luxury yachts rather than food, for example, might generate short term profits for the manufacturers of yachts at the expense of long term ability of the economy to feed the workers needed to manufacture those yachts.

Market prices might convey information about preferences and opportunity costs more efficiently than other methods of collecting those data, but that does not mean they are themselves objective and thus rational. These are degrees of difference, not separate categories. 

Let’s also now consider a feature of any economic organization at a scale beyond the sole proprietor: bureaucracy. Mises imagined that bureaucracy was a feature of states and central planning, not firms, and treated all of the intermediate officials in a large firm as essentially extensions of the entrepreneur’s will. However, we know that this is not the case and that the principle-agent dilemma applies to profit-seeking capitalist bureaucracy within a firm as much as it does to any state.

Whatever objective information is conveyed by market prices is mediated by any subordinates between those market prices and the entrepreneur making decisions about the firm’s allocation of capital. So if a subordinate conveys price information upwards inaccurately, the entrepreneur can only make decisions based on this inaccurate information.

Consider a large firm with a unit that produces software. A subordinate in charge of this unit fires a team of experienced and expensive software engineers and replaces them with a subscription to an LLM service that hallucinates slop code. This unit’s quarterly earnings report might reflect an increase in profits as its labor costs decrease in relation to income. An entrepreneur at the top of this firm can “see” the price information in this quarterly earnings report, but lacks the technical knowledge at the site of production to evaluate the validity of those numbers and make those prices rationally “legible.” As a result, the entrepreneur makes inefficient decisions to allocate resources to this unit based on price information that cannot be used to make rational forecasts about future earnings. 

So we see that even capitalist firms in free markets with price information about consumer demand and capital markets are subject to the ECP, in that their decisions will contain some level of irrationality and arbitrariness.

This is not some fatal flaw. It is simply a feature of any decisionmaking—it can never be performed perfectly rationally. Consider Hayek:

> There is no reason to expect that production would stop, or that the authorities would find difficulty in using all the available resources somehow, or even that output would be permanently lower than it had been before planning started…[We should expect] the excessive development of some lines of production at the expense of others and the use of methods which are inappropriate under the circumstances. We should expect to find overdevelopment of some industries at a cost which was not justified by the importance of their increased output and see unchecked the ambition of the engineer to apply the latest development elsewhere, without considering whether they were economically suited in the situation.

Which is to say that the ECP is best understood as a universal and inescapable feature of human existence—we can never know something with perfect certainty and thus our decisions about the future will never be perfectly rational—rather than some fatal flaw in any particular economic system. 

The ECP just means that any attempt to collect and apply information to decisions about the allocation of resources will always fall short of some hypothetically ideal and perfectly rational calculation, not that economic decisions and activity are impossible.

based,CapitalismVSocialism,CMV: Anarcho-capitalism is an oxymoronic ideology,"Anarchism is a political philosophy whose most influential figure is Mikhail Bakunin, a contemporary of Karl Marx, who advocated for the immediate abolition of the state to destroy capitalism and create a worker-led, autonomous society without money, class, or social hierarchies. Proudhon the founder of the ideology also completely rejected the notion of the state as well.

Capitalism, in practice, depends on the existence of the state not only to recognize a currency for trade and transactions but crucially to enforce the private property rights of the bourgeoisie who own the means of production. The owners of the means of production hold the authority to determine workers' wages based on profitability, along with deciding how much surplus value to extract from labor to increase their profit.

Capitalism, in the instance of the absence of the state, would immediately fail because there would be no governing authority to stop the workers from rebelling against the individual or smaller group of people who own the means of production from the workers seizing it themselves so that they could profit off of their labor, or potentially decommodify the products of their labor as a whole to meet public demand.

Most ""anarcho-capitalists"" that I have encountered argue for limited government intervention with corporations and businesses while still having the state exist to recognize and enforce those same property rights per the ownership of the means of production; this is antithetical to the ""anarchism"" portion of anarcho-capitalism, which essentially becomes an argument for 19th-century laissez-faire capitalism or Gilded Age capitalism in the United States.",32,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1lbgm1w/cmv_anarchocapitalism_is_an_oxymoronic_ideology/,1749928500.0,1lbgm1w
based,CapitalismVSocialism,Linear Programming and Economic Miscalculation: In Defense of the ECP,"**Introduction**: Recently, there has been an influx in debate regarding the economic calculation problem and the implications of linear programming, and whether or not the Misesian calculation problem still holds true in light of recent technological developments. This post will serve not only as a brief exposition to economic calculation and linear programming, but also as a thorough dismantling of multiple stems from the original linear programming argument. I will provide the overview of the economic calculation and the assumptions made by Mises in his original essay (section 1,) an overview of linear programming (section 2,) an analysis from multiple different lenses including epistemological, complexity/computational economics, etc. (section 3.) and a conclusion (section 4.)

**Section 1**

To start off, I’d like to preface this post with an introduction and demonstration of relevance of the economic calculation problem (ECP hereout.) The ECP simply states there exists no way for a socialist commonwealth to rationally (non-arbitrarily) allocate the means of production as long as they are publicly owned. In other words, without the existence of economic calculation which is essentially an aggregation of inputs and outputs through a commensurable variable such as price that serves a purpose of evaluating different courses of action, which can only stem from the existence of markets particularly for capital goods/factors of production since that is the focus of Mises argument, all decisions must necessarily be arbitrary and irrational. Decisions made will also tend to forgo potential opportunities because the planner has no meaningful mechanism to discover or evaluate the forgone alternatives, leading to *arbitrary* rather than economically rational decisions.

Reverting back to the relevancy of price one may ask the question “What if we are to simply prescribe a non-price homogenous variable (P) which serves to commensurate heterogenous factors A, B, and C?” A Misesian should answer “You may be able to prescribe P, but in order for economic calculation to occur P must necessarily be able to accurately determine productive efficiency and represent the value of different factors of production and processes to employ.” For the variable P to be rational, it must also meet the following two criteria: knowledge of consumer demand through rate of consumption and supply in terms of units produced as well as reserved for productive use.

 Now that the introduction of economic calculation and relevancy of price to economic calculation has been established, I will lay out the assumptions made by Mises in the development of his argument which are as follows:

1. Complete information as to every and all consumer demands
2. The relevant quantities and qualities of all the different factors of production, both original and produced 
3. Every one of the technological recipes in existence that is used for producing consumer goods
4. Complete agreement on what exact course of action to take regarding what needs to be produced (i.e., no bureaucratical or political barriers in decision making)

While market clearing price for consumer goods is of secondary relevance to the problem for Mises as his problem deals more specifically with production, let us note that Mises does *not* assume prices for consumer goods in his argument. However, it is necessary to emphasize the economic calculation problem is not a criticism of the distribution of consumption goods but rather the *allocation of capital goods*.

Now that the concept of the ECP has been introduced, I will demonstrate the concept through a simple example provided by Mises to conclude this first section.

*“The director wants to build a house. Now there are many methods that can be resorted to. Each of them offers, from the point of view of the director, certain advantages and disadvantages with regard to the utilization of future building, and results in a different duration of the building's serviceableness; each of them requires other expenditures of building materials and labor and absorbs other periods of production. Which method should the director choose? He cannot reduce to a common denominator the items of various materials and various kinds of labor to be expended. Therefore he cannot compare them. He cannot attach either to the waiting time (period of production) or to the duration of serviceableness, a definite numerical expression. In short, he cannot, in comparing costs to be expended and gains to be earned, resort to any arithmetical operation. The plans of his architects enumerate a vast multiplicity of various items in kind: they refer to the physical and chemical qualities of various items in kind; they refer to the physical productivity of various machines, tools, and procedures. But all their statements remain unrelated to each other. There is no means of establishing any connection between them.""*

**Section 2**

Now, let us introduce the concept of linear programming and the relevance to the ECP. Linear programming, also known as linear optimization, refers to a mathematical *optimization* technique which serves to achieve a best outcome (typically a maximum or minimum) in systems of linear constraints & bounds for a linear objective function. In mathematical terms, the optimal solution to a linear program is the vertex of a polytope,  A well-cited example of linear programming involves determining the most cost effective yet nutritional diet for a child where all the variables, constraints, and objective functions are parameters of a mathematical optimization problem. For further reading see [https://developers.google.com/optimization/lp/stigler\_diet](https://developers.google.com/optimization/lp/stigler_diet) .  
  
To demonstrate the relevance of linear programming and the potential implications on allocation of capital goods, I cite Leonid Kantorovich who was one of the first to use linear programming for an economic purpose:

“I discovered that a whole range of problems of the most diverse character relating to  
the scientific organization of production (questions of the optimum distribution of  
the work of machines and mechanisms, the minimization of scrap, the best utilization of raw materials and local materials, fuel, transportation, and so on) lead to the  
formulation of a single group of mathematical problems (extremal problems). These  
problems are not directly comparable to problems considered in mathematical anal-  
ysis. It is more correct to say that they are formally similar, and even turn out to be  
formally very simple, but the process of solving them with which one is faced \[i.e., by  
mathematical analysis\] is practically completely unusable, since it requires the solu-  
tion of tens of thousands or even millions of systems of equations for completion.  
I have succeeded in finding a comparatively simple general method of solving this  
group of problems which is applicable to all the problems I have mentioned, and is  
sufficiently simple and effective for their solution to be made completely achievable  
under practical conditions.« (Kantorovich 1960: 368)“

Let us note early on and place emphasis on the phrase *optimum distribution of the work of machines and mechanisms, minimization of scrap, the best utilization of raw materials and local materials, fuel, transportation, and so on* and also *sufficiently simple and effective for their solution to be made completely achievable*  
*under practical conditions*. The [reactionary](https://medium.com/the-weird-politics-review/marxist-economist-paul-cockshott-is-a-reactionary-1bd594b40526) Dr. Paul Cockshott of the socialist camp seemed to take this mathematical linear optimization concept one step further and apply it to socialist central planning, eventually concluding ""*Linear programming, originally pioneered by Kantorovich, provides an answer in principle to von Mises claim that rational economic calculation is impossible without money.""* I do not feel the need to explain the exact workings of Cockshott’s system and the vast majority of criticisms provided from this point forward will be against a general algorithmic approach to central planning, which includes basic linear programming/optimization and Cockshott-ian arguments.

**Section 3**

This section will propose a series of different arguments by examining the concept of economic linear programming through multiple different lenses, as well as granting certain assumptions strictly for the sake of argument to the socialists.

*The Problem of Market Dynamism*

The first and most fundamental flaw made by the advocates of economic linear optimization is the static assumption on which it operates. The economy as it currently exists is in a constant state of disequilibrium in an attempt to reach equilibrium through an evolutionary process of discovery and continuous adaptation. The market coordination system is driven by entrepreneurship that does not necessarily optimize in known quantified constraints which vastly differentiates it from the LO assumption of fixed quantifiable coefficients with stable relationships in which will be disputed later. The entrepreneurial discovery process is inherently nonlinear and involves the recognition of unprogrammable profitable opportunities that generate profit through the ever changing satisfaction of subjective consumer preferences.

Furthermore, the temporal dimension is a dimension that tends to be ignored within the constraints of LO yet it is of utmost importance. By the time an ‘optimized function’ is created by the central planner, coefficients and constraints are determined, and the function is somehow computed (more on this later,) the subjective preferences of the consumers and quantities may have already changed making the optimized function in fact suboptimal and requiring a new one be made just for the process to repeat over and over again, perpetuating a state of complete disequilibrium with no tendency towards equilibrium.. in other words, a surplus of shortages and shortage of surpluses. The optimized function *must* remain constant throughout the process of computation otherwise it will be intractable, further perpetuating this state.

*The ‘Optimized Function’*

Second, we must examine the notion of an ‘optimized function’ and whether or not this function is truly optimal let alone rational. An optimized function presupposes some sort of prior goalset on which the function must be based on; whether that function be maximal output & minimal input, a ‘social welfare function’ (deemed impossible via Arrow’s theorems), a utility maximizing function, etc.

Now, recall in Section 1 the problem stated was summarized as an inability in the socialist commonwealth for factors of production to be allocated in a rational (non-arbitrary) way. Mises did not reject the notion that a socialist planner *can* allocate capital goods, the emphasis of his problem was that any allocation not through markets (all planning) must necessarily be *irrational*, and thus arbitrary because of it. The existence of an optimized function further substantiates this notion of arbitrary allocation because the function is either *chosen* by the planner to achieve a specific goal set arbitrarily. We can then ask the question, who chooses this goal set and this optimized function, and what makes it optimized? If it is the planner who chooses, the possibility of political issues arising grows exponentially. If it is the democratic populus who chooses, we will always have an unsatisfied group even through ranked choice voting as demonstrated by Arrow’s impossibility theorem, but we must also ask the question of how often these optimized functions shall be voted on as well as who determines this rate of choice. The political issues implied by the existence of an objective function require authoritarianism to enforce so the possibility of anarcho-LP must be eliminated, and by any other means our commonwealth will experience a multitude of psychological effects that will be elaborated on later.

*The Incompleteness and Computational Intractability*

I previously made a post on this topic which truly deserves a reprise due to the lack of proper flow, bad formatting, and errors within it, but this section will be used to summarize and add to it through a series of multiple tractability and complexity based arguments. Gödel’s theorems of incompleteness prove the exhaustibility of mathematical formulations; in other words they disprove the fact that mathematics can be mechanized, as not all arithmetic reasoning is inherently algorithmic or computational.

The Penrose-Lucas argument builds upon this logic by stating there exists propositions as Gödelian sentences which cannot be computed by an algorithm, but only by a human mind. Even if somehow we have an ultra powerful computer that can compute beyond the capabilities of a human mind, it will either be incorrect or the correctness will not be comprehensible by our minds. Further elaborating on Gödel, the introduction of a new algorithm makes comprehension simpler for a human but more complicated for algorithms due to the abstract nature of the human mind. A computation machine can theoretically be infinite for humans but must by nature be limited for algorithms with an arbitrary stopping rule.

There exists two problems, the practical issue of the contradictory self referentiality due to planners relying on the past to forecast the future (as demonstrated by Roger Koppl,) and the epistemological issue I will quote Tai v. Nguyen for “Since neoclassical economic theory is built upon axiomatic choice theory, they (Velupillai, Bucciarelli, and Mattioso) assert, it suffers as an axiomatic system from Gödel’s incompleteness theorems. As a result, the solution to the optimization problem is not just hard to compute, but could even be undeterminable. Furthermore, we cannot even show whether there exists an effective algorithm which economic agents could use to arrive at the optimum.”

Furthermore, Velupillai argues based on Rice’s theorem “Given a class of choice functions that do generate preference orderings (pick out the set of maximal alternatives) for any agent, there is no effective procedure to decide whether or not any arbitrary choice function is a member of the given class.” In other words, the possibility of a utility maximizing optimized function is inherently impossible to compute algorithmically. Preferences must be noncomputable by the very nature of Rice’s theorems. Based on this and Gödel’s theorems presented in the beginning, we conclude that the primitive algorithm cannot be computed by a algorithm and only by a human mind.

The Halting problem proven undecidable by Turing has demonstrated that we cannot even know for certain whether or not the linear program will even terminate for a dynamic, complex economy. Moreover, no central machine or planner, let alone a technique of linear optimization based on arbitrary constraints and bounds, can perform the nonalgorithmic calculations done on a daily basis by consumers and entrepreneurs in the market based economy.

*The Assumptions and Errors*

The foundations on which an objective function, constraints, and bounds are determined are fundamentally flawed. As previously demonstrated with the issue of creating an objective function and a static assumption, the assumption of linearity already creates a contradiction in itself, but we can go further.

Assuming a somehow tractable machine learning algorithm (beyond the scope of a pure linear optimization) is put in place by the planner, we must discuss the possibility of a mistake on behalf of this algorithm. A bias-variance tradeoff simply defined is a relationship between the complexity of a model, predictions on previously unseen data, and the accuracy of said predictions. The bias is an error from assumptions while the variance is an error from sensitivity. The algorithm must make certain assumptions to be tractable and avoid high variance, however we have currently seen that all similar models ultimately go wrong when trying to balance bias and variance. The issue is, we can encounter substantial issues not previously foreseen to a degree far greater than any market issue. The solution to the problem may lie orthogonal to the vector set where the collected data spans, making the detection of said data virtually impossible algorithmically.

*The Computation Thereof*

Analysis and literature has been conducted on the topic of “what if it is actually tractable, static assumptions are granted, and a function is determined” particularly by Engelhardt (2023) who granted the socialists the simplicity of a single-step production function to replace the absurdly large amounts under a real economy, and essentially collapsed the argument of economic calculation itself to focus on the feasibility and computational power required to compute such algorithms. He tracked the volume of transactions rather than the production process, and concluded that even by using Cottrell (2021)’s own functions and methods, and by using the Frontier super-computer it will take approximately 108,259 years of calculation and a whopping total of 21 MW (around twenty million gigawatts) of power to complete just one function for a global socialist economy. The premise of this part simply put: it is not computationally feasible to plan an economy, even granted the biggest assumptions.

*The Limitations of Inputs*

I will be slightly deviating from the premise of the economic calculation problem here to a more Hayekian knowledge problem approach but the argument deserves to be presented nonetheless. It is physically impossible for an optimized function to acquire the necessary information needed for its operation in the first place. As previously stated in the section about assumptions and errors, a solution may lie orthogonal to the vector set on which the data is collected. In other words, the solution may be unbeknownst because the optimized function is limited by its very own inputs.

There is an inherent impossibility in treating units as homogenous variables due to the nature of dimensional analysis. How are we to compare 1 oil/barrel and 100 pencils/case without the expression of exchange ratios that emerge through human action and can properly aggregate the different qualities and quantities of goods?  The necessary informational requirements for a proper optimized function not only pose an issue of comparison but also an issue of acquisition, for how do we know everything happening and the exact quantities and qualities of specific goods, and how can those be compared. Entrepreneurs and decision makers do not work with fully known probabilities and possibilities but rather they operate on the uncertainty and risk to achieve an acquired ends. Fixed constraints given to a function ignore the fact that constraints do not simply exist as physical givens but rather they emerge through the interactions of individuals.

*The Psychological Effects*

We will assume an optimized function that abstracts demand and thus consumer preferences from our function, we will focus on a ‘maximal output, minimal input’ function. Since we are abstracting the preferences of consumers in our decision making in favor of quantifiable constraints, we must necessarily deal with the psychological consequences that will be briefly outlined.

Let us think about Campbell’s law for a moment: ""the more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor"" Since the abstracted inputs and outputs are quantitative social indicators by the very definition, we are prone to a corruptive pressure. It can be reasonably deduced that bad actors may exist (I am aware this is an assumption Mises granted, this is for the sake of argument.) Our constraints may then limit the truthfulness of our inputs, which in turn provides more room for error.

Misallocation in reference to consumer preferences is entirely possible and basically a given under a form of maximal output minimal input central planning. Because of this, individuals may experience a persistence denial of desired goods  or the psychological consequences of regret from forgone opportunities of which they had no control over.

We have seen through multiple psychological studies the impacts of misallocations on the psychological health of the individuals within the regions. We have also seen the economic effects of these psychological impacts in terms of productivity and offset of the positive effects of innovation. Furthermore we’ve seen the effects of all of the above on the morale, mortality, physical health, etc. of a commonwealth. All studies will be linked below.

*The Homogenizing Variables Approach*

This section has a very general title but to specify, it will be covering the use of non-price homogenizing variables, specifically labor time, as a way to commensurate different quantities and qualities of goods. It will cover the existing ‘empirics’ of a labor-value correlation as well as the feasibility of measuring labor time for a capital goods.

To start off, I will briefly cover the existing empirics of labor-value correlations and their relevance to linear optimization. The claim that a non-price homogenizing variable such as labor times can be used to commensurate incommensurable factors of production is based on the current existence of correlations between ‘value’ and ‘price’. Upon further examination of said empirics particularly by the likes of Cockshott, Shaikh, Zacariah, etc. we see one similarity: they all measure the correlations at the sectoral level. We then must ask ourselves the question, why is it at the sectoral level and how can that be feasibly applied and used as a constraint/bound for our linear program? The simple answer is: it’s impossible. In order to do that based on these empirics, we must aggregate the commodities within the given sectors. This may be feasible for some sectors such as Footware or Oil Manufacturing, however when we reach things like Steel (i.e., steel rods, bars, beams, etc.,) Ceramic Products, Weapons & Munition, etc. it does not make sense to use given ‘labor times’ to compute a homogenous variable. A bullet and a gun are both under the weapons & munition sector, so how on earth will we price both of them based on the labor time of the currently existing empirics which justify a correlation?

The pseudointellectual may naively answer: “We can measure the labor time of a commodity,” however they would be operating on a fundamental misunderstanding of labor, we cannot do such a thing. For one, if there existed a way to measure the labor time of a commodity it would have already been done and used in empirical works to justify Marx’s labor theory of value. For two, the embodiment of ‘dead labor’ within the production process of a commodity means the measurement of labor time becomes infeasible. See the case of a simple pencil; we begin with wood from a tree, cut down by a saw made with steel at a manufacturing plant. We mine graphite with pickaxes made from wood (which exists naturally through tree growth, which takes years) and iron (which is an already existing natural resource that can only be mined, not grown), how is it possible to calculate the combined times and dead labor within a capital good to price it and homogenize this variable between all the different capital goods that go into a production process? It is not. For three, the labor of individuals is heterogenous and there exists no way to compare the skill of a doctor and a technician or a cashier simply through time. It is incommensurable and skill Is inherently qualitative, thus there is no quantitative way to represent skill and make a skill multiplier function to properly account for the skilled labor embodied within a commodity. Even if we take prior schooling time, many professions either do not require schooling, can be learned at home through family, or do training on the job which can differ by a person’s understanding and skill. It is impossible.

*The Heterogeneity of Capital*

As demonstrated in the previous section, the use of labor times as a homogenizing variable is unquantifiable in the realm of constraints & bounds for a linear optimization, further insinuating the already known; linear programming is not a solution. To continue this point further from a broader perspective, I will bring up the natural heterogeneity, or multiple employable uses, of capital. For example, take the use of steel which can be employed in a multitude of uses including railroads, housing, vehicles, factories, technology, etc.

Capital assets differ in their use, scale, and temporal structure so simply placing some arbitrary numeraire on it  will not suffice in the commensuration of two different capital assets if that numeraire is not price. Any reduction to a quantifiable factor as demonstrated in previous sections, if even possible, must necessarily ignore the qualitative and tacit knowledge that goes into a decision in the current state of affairs. Producers do not make explicitly quantifiable decisions under the market system, they instead leverage the quantifiable but ultimately decide based on tacit knowledge not granted to any form of linear programming. There is no quantified comparison due to the heterogeneity of capital, and no way to reduce the aggregate of information provided through price effectively in a way that can commensurate two capital goods in the socialist commonwealth.

*The Efficacy of Maximal Value, Minimal Input Linear Programs*

Lastly, perhaps the most relevant section of all will cover the efficacy of maximal value/output and minimal input linear programs more in depth than the other sections. The influx of posts that inspired this megapost come particularly from the usage of linear optimizations seeking to maximize the value of a commodity while minimizing the inputs. Of course, the criticisms of all the other sections still apply here even if not directly mentioned.

Maximal value in the uses previously employed in this subreddit would typically imply maximizing a p (price of x) variable and a q (quantity of x) variable based on given constraints. Ignoring the issues of the constraints and the establishment of the objective function, is maximizing the price and quantity truly the *value maximizing function?*

Similarly, minimal input in the uses previously employed on this subreddit would typically imply minimizing the quantity of inputs, perhaps w (wage of x) and l (in x acres of land) that go into producing a good as much as possible but still being able to produce a decent output. Once again, ignoring the issues of the constraints and establishment of the objective function, is the combination of maximal value output and minimal input truly the *value maximizing function* of which we should base our economy? Let us explore a few different concepts

Economies of scale refers to the concept that the cost advantages a company gains by increasing its production volume may lead to lower average costs per unit. This can be interpreted in the realm of linear programming. It would be logical to suggest increasing quantity q to reduce average input cost and thus increase output value, but would this be a true economic decision? There also exists a concept called *diseconomies of scale* which is essentially the opposite of an economy of scale, that is beyond a certain threshold companies begin to increase in rise in average per-unit cost compared to output. Would it be a true economic decision to decrease the production based on these quantified factors? The very assumptions of convex production sets and linear constraints made by a linear program would make it fundamentally incapable of accounting for the nonlinear effects presented by dis/economies of scale.

I can truly go on about the different concepts that prove the failure of this max-min function to truly optimize by talking about time, risk, uncertainty, innovation, preferences, etc. but I feel these arguments may be derived in themselves from the other sections. The existence of a common concept that can dispute the general max-min function is all that is needed to reduce the credibility thereof.

**Section 4**

The takeaway of this post is simple: linear programming is not a refutation of the economic calculation problem. I have covered multiple theoretical, a few mathematical, a few computational, and a psychological ground(s) which are all valid argument against the use of algorithms and linear programming against the economic calculation problem. This post is the product of around three separate days of work with around 2-3 hours per day of research and writing. Citations will be provided in a separate comment.

based,CapitalismVSocialism,Which Theory Of Value And Distribution Applies To Your Country?,"**1. Introduction**

I am curious about the laws of motion of capitalism. I have been concentrating on price theory. Here, I briefly overview some extensions for the theory of distribution. Even if my understanding was better, such short summaries would no doubt be inadequate.

**2. A Marxian Theory**

I recently [illustrated](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1kf9r5w/can_you_follow_a_market_algorithm/) a dynamical process in which market prices, given single production, converge to [prices of production.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1kckct7/prices_of_production_in_general_joint_production/) It converges in other cases too.

In my exposition, I took wages as given. This can be called a Marxian theory of value and distribution. Here, in comments on the physiocrats, Marx takes a minimum of wages as given:

>“Therefore the foundation of modern political economy, whose business is the analysis of capitalist production, is the conception of the *value of labour capacity* as something fixed, as a given magnitude—as indeed it is in practice in each particular case. The *minimum of wages* therefore correctly forms the pivotal point of Physiocratic theory. They were able to establish this although they had not yet recognised the nature of value itself, because this *value of labour capacity* is manifested in the price of the necessary means of subsistence, hence in a sum of definite use values. Consequently, without being in any way clear as to the nature of value, they could conceive the value of labour capacity, so far as it was necessary to their inquiry, as a definite magnitude. If moreover they made the mistake of conceiving this *minimum* as an unchangeable magnitude—which in their view is determined entirely by nature and not by the stage of historical development, which is itself a magnitude subject to fluctuations—this in no way affects the abstract correctness of their conclusions, since the difference between the value of labour capacity and its valorisation does not at all depend on whether the value is assumed to be great or small.” -- Karl Marx, Theories of Surplus Value, Part 1. Marx and Engels Collected Works, Vol. 30, p. 354

I find the above insightful. By the way, Quesnay, the leader of the physiocratic school, is often said to have created a forerunner of Leontief's input-output analysis.

**3. A Monetary Theory of Distribution**

Suppose capitalists expect the monetary authority to keep the long-term interest rate anchored. In the United States, T-Notes would tend to have a constant return. And suppose the rate of industrial profits were a constant markup over this interest rate. Then prices of production would be determined.

As I understand it, this is close to the monetary theory of distribution of Carlo Panico and Massimo Pivetti.

**4. A Post Keynesian Theory**

Richard Kahn, Nicholas Kaldor, Luigi Pasinetti, and Joan Robinson developed a Post Keynesian theory, in the 1950s and early 1960s, of the long run. Postulate that the savings rate out of profits is higher than that out of wages. Pasinetti argues for this condition based on household behavior. Kaldor argues that it is rather a matter of retained earnings, corporate policy, and finance.

At any rate, the Cambridge equation follows:

*r* = *g*/*sp*

where *r* is the rate of profits, *g* is the rate of growth, and *sp* is the saving rate out of profits. Joan Robinson’s banana diagram results from assuming that the rate of growth is a function of the rate of profits:

*g* = f(*r*)

a fuller formulation would distinguish between expected and realized profits, as well as the stability of the solutions. Anyways, prices of production are obtained from these relationships, just as in the previous models.

Currently, I think this theory is descriptive of consistency conditions, not a causal model.

**5. An Overdetermined Theory**

Suppose more than one of the above theories applies. Then the model is overdetermined. (Overdetermination is both Hegelian jargon and a precise term in mathematics.)

In the above sections, I have been talking about the real wage. Inflation is one way of resolving the overdetermination. Conflict over income distribution as a cause of inflation is a recurring Post Keynesian idea.

I find this theory in Marglin (1984). But I also find a theory of stagflation along these lines in Robinson (1962). Suppose economics were a science. When a prominent scholar has developed a theory of a phenomenon a decade before it occurs, those studying the subject would investigate her work and build on it. The textbooks commonly used would explain this theory.

**6. Wages-Led and Profits-Led Regimes**

Bhaduri and Marglin have developed a macroeconomic model in which real wages are given from outside the model. They argue this is possible in open economies, with foreign trade.

Wages are both a cost and a major component in effective demand. Focus on one or the other aspect supports specific political ideologies.

Their model results in classifying regimes as either wages-led or profits-led.

**7. Conclusion**

I do not expect any one of these theories to apply in all times and places. I do not even claim the above summaries are exhaustive. It is an empirical question which better describes any given country or region’s economy at any particular time.

As I understand it, mechanical models of the ether were all the rage at the end of the nineteenth century. I would not expect a physicist to teach such theories to students today in introductory classes. Likewise, I have nothing to say about utility-maximization.

based,CapitalismVSocialism,Mutual Aid Economics is Incredibly Stupid,"Mutual Aid is great, and happens all of the times. But to  create an entire economic system based only on Mutual Aid is stunningly stupid. Here is why:

* **No markets = no price signals.** Without money or prices, it's very hard to know what people need or want
* **No central planning = no planning at all:** In theory you don't need markets, and can replace it with planning. In which case coordinating resources across large distances requires centralization. Local communities can’t ""vote"" on all of their needs for global resources, like rare medical supplies or specialized computer chips. And, what if community x doesn't want to supply community y with resources needed to make computer chips?
* **Global Crises:** Mutual aid would essentially require *seamless* coordination between communities, an absolute logistical nightmare. And this is assuming they all agree to coordinate in the first place.
* **Good old tribalism:** Some communities will become tribal. And restrict access to outsiders. And resources. 
* **Power!:** Some individuals will want to dominate others. No centralized authority means communities have to combat this. And you have to assume all of them will come together to do so.
   * **Warlords:** The idea that local communities can resist the formation of centralized power structures by other communities by constantly fighting them is ridiculous. And if this is your ideal solution, then you are advocating for decentralized warlords to rule. Unless you expect every single community to never form hierarchies.
* **No enforcement mechanisms:** Without a central authority, who resolves conflicts between different communities? Other communities? Which ones? Who determines which community is moral and should be supported?
   * **Corruption:** Say my community is corrupt, and not following the principles of mutual aid. If we are unable to fix it, who steps in? Who determines who should step in? What if the communities that try and step in end up being worse?

This is why the only serious threat to capitalism is Marxist-Leninism. Because if capitalism is the king of contradictions, anarchism is the emperor of them. I find absolutely no threat from anarchists, and if I were a business owner, I'd be ready for an economic boom under anarchism, albeit on the black market, or until I could convince my local community to let me run my firm",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1kc5rpv/mutual_aid_economics_is_incredibly_stupid/,1746096650.0,1kc5rpv
npc,CapitalismVSocialism,China is closer to Fascist Italy than it is to the USSR.,"
You've probably seen some socialists defending the Chinese model as an example of socialism. However, if you analyze it, that country seems more like a corporatism painted red than the Soviet Union.

### Economy

**Italy:**
Mussolini's fascist regime promised the Italian people a new economic system known as corporatism, often presented as a ""third way"" that transcended the perceived failures of both capitalism and socialism. This system envisioned the organization of industries into state-controlled corporations, comprising both workers and employers within the same profession or sector, all operating under the guidance of the state.

In practice, this translated into the state wielding significant power to direct economic production and the allocation of resources, a concept often referred to as *economic dirigisme*. While the principle of private property was not completely abolished, the state maintained ultimate control over the economy, acting ostensibly in the best interests of the nation.

A key feature of this corporatist system was the outlawing of independent labor unions and the prohibition of strikes and other forms of labor action, effectively eliminating traditional mechanisms for workers to advocate for their rights.

**China:**
Contemporary China operates under a developing mixed socialist market economy, characterized by the implementation of strategic industrial policies and comprehensive five-year plans. This economic model incorporates a diverse range of ownership structures, including state-owned enterprises (SOEs), mixed-ownership entities, and a substantial and dynamic private sector.

Despite the significant role of market forces, the government maintains a central and influential position in the economy, exercising considerable control over key industries, often referred to as the ""commanding heights,"" and engaging in pervasive administrative involvement.

The Chinese government maintains a strict and comprehensive regulatory framework governing business activities within the nation, often exceeding the levels of regulation seen in countries like the United States and the European Union. This includes the implementation of a system of pre-entry national treatment for foreign investment, coupled with a detailed negative list that specifies sectors where foreign investment is either restricted or prohibited.

Numerous laws and regulations dictate various aspects of business operations, encompassing areas such as export controls, sanctions compliance, anti-bribery measures, and data protection protocols. Additionally, the overarching goals and priorities outlined in China's five-year plans significantly influence the formulation and implementation of regulations across various sectors, including areas like dual circulation, environmental sustainability, and consumer protection.

Both Fascist Italy and contemporary China exhibit significant state intervention in their respective economies. Both also employed a form of state-directed capitalism, where private businesses operated under the considerable influence and control of the state, aligning their activities with national objectives.

In both systems, national economic goals were prioritized over the interests of individual businesses or specific economic classes. The concept of ""corporatism"" in Fascist Italy, with its state-controlled unions and employer associations designed to harmonize interests under state guidance, finds parallels in the role of state-controlled labor organizations and industry associations in China.

Furthermore, both regimes initially pursued some liberal economic policies before gradually shifting towards greater state control and intervention.

The main difference is that Fascist Italy wanted to be self-sufficient, while China does not. Basically, every major company in China has at least one of its owners as a party member.

### Nationalism in China

Nationalism constitutes a powerful and pervasive force in contemporary China, with a strong focus on fostering cultural and national unity among its populace. This nationalism is deeply rooted in the historical memory of past injustices and perceived humiliations at the hands of foreign powers, and it is further fueled by a potent desire for national rejuvenation, often encapsulated in the widely promoted ""Chinese Dream"" concept.

The Chinese government actively promotes cultural identity and heritage through a multitude of initiatives and policies. This includes the vigorous promotion of what is termed ""Excellent Traditional Chinese Culture"" and the deliberate construction of a comprehensive system of symbols representing Chinese cultural identity. There is a noticeable emphasis on reviving and popularizing traditional Chinese clothing, such as the *Hanfu*, alongside other traditional cultural practices.

This ""cultural rejuvenation"" is what they call *Palingenesis*, one of the key features of fascism.

And I haven't even mentioned yet that China is expansionist; after all, they have territorial disputes with nearly all of their neighbors. They also have a personality cult in a one-party state and are quite xenophobic toward foreigners.

globalist,CapitalismVSocialism,"When Globalism Falls, American Liberty Will Rise","Dynamic change is unsettling.  We humans grasp at the status quo and squeeze.  Alas, the globalist cartel wants to ""fundamentally transform"" the world, and whether we like it or not, we are along for the ride.  Many Westerners are only now waking up to the reality that a ridiculously small group of influential ""elites"" have been pushing us down this path for quite some time.  Future history books will highlight (when factual history returns to education) how WWII served as the inflection point for unleashing a torrent of international institutions and norms (disguised as mechanisms for ""maintaining the peace"") that have succeeded in concentrating wealth and power in a small number of people intent on ruling over everyone else.

Their centralized control over monetary currencies has made them fabulously rich and left everyone else in debt.  Property, income, purchases, inheritances — everything you ""own"" through the fruits of your labor is taxed and laundered by corrupt legislatures back into the pockets of the same currency-manipulators who print money and buy off politicians for a living.  You are taxed for simply holding a dollar in your hand because every day, that dollar loses value through intentionally constructed inflation used to prop up stock market ""growth"" while destroying middle-class savings.  The World Economic Forum wants Westerners to ""own nothing,"" and by golly, through taxation and inflation alone, it's halfway there.  

The globalist cartel lies about everything.  The same players who bemoan ""income inequality"" have used the post-WWII order to steal at least half the value of every person's lifetime of labor.  (American colonists rebelled over a tax rate of 1%!)  The same ""woke"" corporations that rail against the ""structural racism"" of Western ""colonialism"" have been conquering the world, exploiting poor nations for cheap manufacturing, and sucking up the savings of wealthier nations through the new-age religion of rampant consumerism.  Globalism is colonialism, but public relations firms have spent decades hiding that obvious truth.

The globalist cartel does not care about ""trans rights"" or ""fighting hate"" or ""climate change.""  It cares about keeping society distracted with silly mass movements, idol-worship, and unscientific doomsday fantasies while it pursues its own interests and hidden agendas.  New World Order ""elites"" couldn't be happier that they have whipped up so many mindless ""serfs"" into such a frenzy that the peasants senselessly demand that their own speech be regulated, religion outlawed, and energy use rationed.  When the squabbling members of society fight among themselves, government power grows to control the chaos.  When only the globalist cartel is allowed free speech, and only the rich and powerful can afford fuel, then only the globalist religion can be heard and spread.  

Chasing that elusive one-world-government perpetual motion machine, ""elites"" always delude themselves into believing they are destined to ""rule.""  They fail to imagine that there are smarter people who have never sought great wealth or power.  So committed to their Darwinian belief that ""natural selection"" proves their own superiority, they have become certain that a future technocratic totalitarian state (with them at the top) is inevitable.  And just as with every attempt to rule the world before it, pride comes before the fall.

The same technologies used to control us today will liberate us tomorrow.  Whereas centralized digital currencies seek to steal our labor and trap our wealth, decentralized currencies beyond the reach of central bank manipulation will open markets to real free trade.  Whereas the national security surveillance state monitors our communications, decentralized protocols will again secure our privacy.  Whereas Big Tech and Big Media have maliciously partnered with Big Government to control the dissemination of information and news, the same workarounds above will eventually break corporate control for good.  Necessity is still the mother of all invention, and when people smarter than the global cartel decide that fighting back is necessary, globalists' monopoly on control will fade.

At the end of the day, it comes down to trust.  Nobody is buying what the globalist cartel is selling.  Their lies and manipulations have become too obvious for too many.  People now realize that truth lies only outside the system.  

Ask yourself, who has been more accurate about the major news stories of the last few years — the government-controlled news cabal pushing the ""narrative"" or your local conspiracy theorist expressing doubts?  Did Obama's FBI not spy on Donald Trump's campaign?  Did Hillary not invent the Russia collusion hoax?  Did mandatory lockdowns for the Chinese Flu not crater the economy, bankrupt businesses, and cause excess deaths?  Did closing tens of thousands of schools not harm children?  Did using people as guinea pigs to test experimental ""vaccines"" not result in unnecessary medical injuries?  Did recklessly printing money not lead to predictable inflation?  Did the globalist cartel's push for Green New Deal controls over every individual's consumption of energy not jack up fuel costs and the price of food?  Did U.S. politicians not use a ""health crisis"" to foist uncontrolled and unsecured mail-in ballots on the 2020 election?  Was that election not fraught with predictable fraud?  Has fighting Russia in Ukraine not weakened America's national security by destabilizing global food and fuel production?  Has that conflict not strengthened Russia and China at America's and Europe's expense?  Are we not closer today than before the ""rules-based international order"" imposed unilateral sanctions on Russia to losing the benefits of the world's use of the dollar as its reserve currency?

According to my math, local conspiracy theorists have been correct every single time.  The global cartel's news propagandists, on the other hand, have not told the truth once.

globalist,CapitalismVSocialism,"theDonald supporters are more marxists than they think, let's take an indepth look. [Share your thoughts]","I've been observing (aka lurking) the thedonald point win (now patriots point win) websites for a while.

I think the truth is always in between when there's such a split media.

Nonetheless, I've observed some interesting things, and that the bulk there is self-declared strongly anti-left, mostly calling all leftist Marxists.

But thedonalds supporters core ideas are ""more communist"" than the democrats.

Of course, ***I have to mention that we must distance here from Trump's real actions, and focus more on what their supporters' ideals are because there is a dissonance there.***

So let's take a look at 2 of their biggest beliefs:

&#x200B;

\- **prioritize small business and hate for ""globalist"" corporations.**

&#x200B;

A lot of people there love the idea of small business and consider them as the very basis of US economy. They feel that those are squashed by government and corporations.

Now, while they don't explicitly hate the idea of corporations, they hate the idea of multinational corporations and ""woke"" corporations. Basically, they hate corporations, since the majority of corporations and the corporate lifecycle is inevitable to expand beyond borders.

If we look at ""American"" corporations: they hate Apple, they hate Google, they hate Amazon, they dislike Walmart, etc.

Basically, their ideal world would be made of small businesses, without big corpos or a state to hinder this utopic market. But that's more closer towards communism, because it would mean most of the population would be business owners, thus the ""means of production"" would be in a big percent of the populations' hands.

&#x200B;

\- **they hate public health care ... but they also kinda love it if you don't call it that and they despise the current US healthcare system**

&#x200B;

Their biggest gripe with public healthcare is their distrust of government. They believe such healthcare would be prone to governmental forced agendas, like favoring a group over another or forcing useless programs to drain their taxes.

But what they hate more is the current US system. They loath the big costs, they loath the fact that it doesn't cover all their fees, and they loath corporations/gov favoring big pharma. Oh and they despise big pharma the most.

For example, they loved the idea of Trump regulating the price of insulin *(like i said, we talk ideas not real actions)* and other meds. Basically, that's a common left thing to do, to regularise the price of meds.

If you would tell them that at the price of current health insurance would get better services, they would definitely follow, even if that would be a national health insurance house. Moreover, if you tell them that NHI would be run as an ONG distanced from the governament.

And let us also take into consideration, that their argument for ""I'm not paying for your healthcare"" is because they believe a lot of diseases can be prevented and you must try your best to prevent them or pay. This is also at core of national health care, which should in theory focus on prevention because is cheaper and more sustainable, and better for the population.

\-

\------

Now if we factor in:

* their love for the army and patriotism propaganda - both very common in marxists countries
* protectionism economic policies (prominent in U.S.S.R. and P.R. China)
* control of immigration and fortifying borders ( wall building, remember RDG)
* dislike for the 1%
* get rid of the lobby and bad political influence that favors the wealthy class for the wealthy ( ""drain the swamp"" - again, ideas not acts)
* hate for banks and the banking systems

&#x200B;

We can see that they are far more down the ""marxists"" path than democrats. Which I find it kinda ironically funny.

woke,CapitalismVSocialism,There has never been a successful socialist society. Socialists still have no answer to this argument,"Socialists love to talk theory, they love to bring books I haven't read and arguments I can't rebut, but when it comes to real world examples, they don't have any. There has never been a successful socialist society.

No, I don't care to give you clear a definition of what I mean by successful. If I did, it might exclude my favorite examples of anarcho-capitalism.

The fact that capitalist countries exist and socialists countries don't means that capitalism is good and socialism is stinky.

No, I can't name a single example of a socialist society that wasn't subverted by fascists(America is included among said fascists). Maybe if socialist societies weren't so stupid and lame, governments around the world wouldn't dedicate money and manpower to assassinating their democratically elected leaders, and replacing them with dictators that protect capital interests. Did I mention that capitalism is the ideology of freedom?

You commies just don't understand. Capitalism builds wealth through ~~the violent imperial extraction of wealth from the global south~~ Free markets and competition and the profit motive and some other term that I heard on the libertarian subreddit that is really escaping me at the moment. In contrast, socialism doesn't build wealth. It just steals the wealth of others. Capitalists would never do that.

Compare the bastion of Capitalism; the United States, O, glory, to the Dirty commie hellhole once known as the USSR.

The USSR, in 70 years, before it was undemocratically dissolved, only managed to turn a feudal backwater into a society that defeated the Nazis, put the first human being in space, achieved nearly free housing, free healthcare, free education and a similar caloric intake to that of the U.S while making food significantly cheaper. In other words, they basically did nothing.

Compare that to the glorious United States. Built on the genocide of one race and the slavery of another. With a long track record of lovely imperialism and 200 years of uninterrupted development. It's now one of the wealthiest nations on earth, with an astounding GDP of 27.72 trillion USD (2023). America, O, America. God shed His grace on thee.

Even ethically speaking, Capitalism is better. [Socialism killed 100 million people according to the most unbiased, reliable, frequently cited source of all time](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Book-Communism-Crimes-Repression/dp/0674076087). Meanwhile [Capitalism only killed a measly 476 million people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIB4e8AfPcM) Small potatoes in comparison to the work of those violent marxists.

In Conclusion, I challenge you socialist-communist-anarchist-marxist-woke-liberals to find me *one* example of socialist society that didn't fail. You wont be able to so you'll have to quote your fancy german economists. Which I will simply interpret as you admitting defeat.

Now if you'll excuse me, the government has forced me to pay my taxes. I'm gonna do it...just...*angrily.*",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1m7eios/there_has_never_been_a_successful_socialist/,1753289523.0,1m7eios
woke,CapitalismVSocialism,Breaking down Proj 2025 - Chapter 22 Part 1 - Tax Policy + Wages and Benefits,"As the election is only recently over, a lot of summaries of P'25 are ridiculously biased against the Trump administration and doesn't cover the implications or ONLY covers the implications (which can't be verified). 

So, I'm going to be doing a breakdown of each chapter, starting with the department of the treasury. As I don't have a lot of time, I'll be doing this piecemeal. 

**Scope:** Covering laws applying to the personal finance of average Americans. 

**Overview:** Primary goals are to make adjustments to    
*tax policy, <--    
*wages and benefits <--   
*financial regulation,    
*geopolitical threat?    
*money laundering    
*policies compensating for systemic inequality    
*policies compensating for climate change    

**Review of Previous Policies**: America is a lot of debt. [1] Americans are poorer [2]. Yellen focused on equity and climate. [3] The treasury must refocus into a non-woke agenda. [4] 

[1] we are still recovering from COVID, so the amount of debt is justified. Any competent government would be spending in times of economic crisis and saving in times of prosperity. 

[2] the wealth disparity is increasing and they're using that rhetoric to appeal to the working class

[3] Yellen was a WHILE ago. J Pow's in the house now. 

[4] Economics, politics and culture are very closely tied. The materials conditions determined by economics greatly impact politics and culture. Similarly, culture and politics greatly impact economics, as evidenced by what they're trying to do. 

**Review of Organization**: Standard stuff. Skipped. 

**Tax Policy:** Flat tax rate of 15% for people earning <176k/yr, 30% for people earning over. If I'm reading this correctly, these 15 and 30%'s cover both income and payroll taxes. At the lowest tax bracket, income is 10% and payroll is like 6-7%. So, this would translate to a tax cut at the lowest level, but it would also de-fund public services. 

Corporate income tax gets a cut of 3% from 21% to 18%. Slight increase to capital accumulation.          
They also want to increase the losses deductible from income for small businesses, which would help them be more resilient to business cycles. This actually decreases capital accumulation because it's only applicable to small businesses. 

They want to start a tax free savings account for all Americans, with a contribution limit of $15,000. Slight increase to capital accumulation. The contribution limit for Canadian TFSA's are much higher. 

**Wages and Benefits**: Here we go. 

> The current tax code has a strong bias that incentives businesses to offer employees more generous benefits and lower wages. This limits the freedom of workers and their families to spend their compensation as they see fit—and it can trap workers in their current jobs due to the jobs’ benefit packages

So the answer is to publicize the benefits so that they'd be available to all, right? 

>To reduce this tax bias against wages (as opposed to employee benefits), the
next Administration should set a meaningful cap (no higher than $12,000 per year
per full-time equivalent employee—and preferably lower) on untaxed benefits
that employers can claim as deductions. 

No, they'll make it more cost efficient for employers to provide higher wages rather than benefits. 

**Fundamental Tax Reform, Supermajority to Raise Taxes, Tax Competition, OECD**: Note that a flat tax will also simplify accounting to reduce costs. A supermajority (3/5) would be needed to change tax laws. Stop exporting tax laws to other countries (as in they want other countries to have lower taxes as well). Removal of the US from OECD. 

**In Summary**: The republican plan for prosperity is to make Americans (as individuals) richer, by reducing the tax burden. The caveat is that wealthier Americans would be getting a lot more from this than poorer Americans, further increasing income inequality. 

**Micro Effects**: The common argument justifying this is that inequality shouldn't matter as long as everyone benefits in some way. Other than an increased disparity in political power, increased inequality also justifies an increase in prices. [5] This means even more people will be priced out of goods and services, with reduced funding in public services that they rely on in exchange for private services that they may also be priced out of. 

So while the less fortunate will have a few more dollars to spend, they'll also see their costs of living increase and programs to alleviate poverty decrease. But for the average American, they'll have more money but they'll also see prices increases. 

The machine runs better if you feed it more meat. 

[5] Income distribution can be modelled using a log normal distribution. As the distribution widens representing higher inequality, the average moves further from the mode. If the price follows the average purchasing power of the population, then more and more people will be priced out of that good or service. 

**Macro Effects**: This is no different from pumping money into the economy. It will cause inflation as I have mentioned before. However, this would be demand-driven inflation and would attract both domestic and foreign investment. As with all inflation, stock and commodity prices will also increase. The USD will also become more valuable as there would be increased international demand. 

Trump did something similar in 2018/2019 with the Chinese trade war, where he pumped a massive amount of money into the economy to offset the detrimental effects of the tariffs. So, this one section of this one chapter, must be taken in context with other policies and strategies.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1gm0eix/breaking_down_proj_2025_chapter_22_part_1_tax/,1731011718.0,1gm0eix
woke,CapitalismVSocialism,Thoughts on this discussion between a left-anarchist and a bio-primitivist?,"I had some fairly good discussions with a bio-primitivist who thinks the only hope for humanity is an anti-tech revolution. So, I just thought I'd copy some of the dialogue here to get people's feedback on whether they think the arguments would be useful for helping convince anti-tech sympathising people in their own life to reconsider some of their positions. Or at least that it might be elucidating in getting a better understanding of where anti-tech people are coming from. And obviously if you sympathise more with them, then we can carry on the discussion here too.

Their ideology is similar to some anarcho-primitivists in that essentially they'd like to just burn everything down to try and get as close to hunter-gatherer life as possible, 'hiding between the cracks' of the feudal war-lords that would rise up. But, crucially they accept the history of some tribes keeping slaves and like the idea of the able-bodied male dominance hierarchies that would likely occur.

Here's an index of the topics covered that I've copied over:

* A. Is primitive society superior to modern society?
   * Positive & Negative Liberties
   * The Cloud Virtue Hypothetical
* B) Do the problems with modern society arise due to Technology or are they due to other factors such as Capitalism/the state/Hierarchy.

And here's a link to the full discussion between multiple people:

[A Collaboratively Edited Discussion on Anti-Tech Politics](https://www.thetedkarchive.com/library/theo-slade-normandie-etc-a-collaboratively-edited-conversation-on-anti-tech-politics)

\-----

## A. Is primitive society superior to modern society?

## Positive & Negative Liberties

**Theo:** I think anprims are deluded in believing primitive life will be a life of egalitarian freedom, but it is what makes them anarchist in my mind, like still wanting to work towards a world of ending dominance hierarchies and maintaining positive liberties.

**Potash:** Primitive life has been proven to be far more free than modern life, if it is egalitarian is a different story. Positive Liberty is a vague-ry that doesn’t really mean anything.

**Theo:** Positive liberty is an essential concept, otherwise we’d have no frame of reference for many of the harms that people commit against each other.

At its most extreme, taking care of someone while they’re in a coma only to afterwards drop them in the middle of a desert to die of thirst is still harming them. Regardless of the fact they’d be free in a negative liberty sense of there being no government taking away their shoes for taxes in the desert or whatever.

**Potash:** I think the man in the desert would have plenty of freedom. He could use his natural ability to take advantage of his environment. It’s far from a death sentence. If he were able to survive, then subsequent freedom would ensure as he and no one else controls the path his life takes.

**Theo:** That wasn’t the kind of scenario I meant. I’ll try to be more clear:

You’re lying unconscious after being thrown from a dune buggy you wrecked. Whilst out driving a dune buggy myself I find you at the centre of these vast desert sand dunes that stretch out for 100s of miles of just pure layers and layers of shifting sand as far as the eye can see. I nurse you back to consciousness, but you’ve still got a broken leg, then rather than driving you out of the hills of sand dunes, I leave you to die.

Surely you think I’ve committed an unethical act by not offering you access to positive liberties?

You’re free from the constraints of oppressive governments in that scenario, but you’re not free to be able to do much of anything other than just waiting to die.

This is just basic tribal social contract stuff, a kid is drowning in quicksand, you can offer him a branch, which would increase his access to a tool that would increase his positive liberties to move around and breathe.

A strong and skilled hunter is all alone in the jungle having fun and able to kill lots of animals to grow fat, he comes across an emaciated kid who is going to be stunted for life due to malnutrition if you don’t share some of your hunted meat with him. You give him some meat, you increase his access to food, you increase his positive liberties in life.

**Potash:** Fair enough, but I don’t think positive liberty is as decisive in determining one’s level of freedom as negative liberty is in most cases.

Primitive societies certainly do not “trample” on positive liberties enough to make them less free than us. They still have far more freedom than we have.

In what ways do primitive societies deprive people of positive liberty?

**Theo:** No one in a primitive society has many positive liberties themselves, and so doesn’t have any ability to offer others much.

In modern societies there are often hospitals, libraries, public transit, etc. So these societies are superior by that metric.

And to take away modern people’s positive liberties and try and forever reduce people and all their progeny to a life without these positive liberties is cruel.

**Potash:** I don’t understand how not having access to public transit makes you a fake anarchist.

I think Modern society deprives us of positive liberty by taking away from us our right to live in our natural habitat, and by greatly devaluing community and relationships.

**Theo:** I think what would make someone a fake anarchist is the bombing people back to the stone age who don’t consent to that happening to them, whilst claiming to be an anarchist.

**Potash:** I think Modern society deprives us of positive liberty by taking away from us our right to live in our natural habitat, and by greatly devaluing community and relationships.

**Theo:** I agree it does that to a lot of people. I think we should organize to resist that, just in a way that preserves other positive liberties.

**Potash:** Not everything can be planned out in advance. Conditions, and not decisions, are the primary driver of any society.

## The Cloud Virtue Hypothetical

**Theo:** I might bite the bullet on the quality of life being slightly worse for the average person day to day in modern capitalist societies vs. a fairly egalitarian tribe in the past living in ignorance of a different way of life. I just think there’s still more virtue in striving for a society beyond capitalism and unjustified hierarchies.

Many people are concerned with remedying a net pain vs. pleasure calculus first and foremost, whereas I’m mostly concerned with people being able to express capabilities that help them achieve goals that satisfy a higher order happy flourishing vs. painful stultifying dichotomy.

Happy flourishing (eudaimonia) is what’s pursued in virtue ethics, by formulating a working balance of character virtues which help you both know what would give you some meaning at a certain stage in your life experience and help you achieve it.

As opposed to preference utilitarianism which is less willing to accept a high degree of suffering and is more interested in getting everyone to a global calculus of their interests being fulfilled thereby achieving a good degree of wellbeing.

As opposed further to by hedonistic utilitarianism, which is even less willing to accept suffering, seeks global pleasure calculus.

As opposed even further by negative utilitarians who are simply concerned with the best ways of avoiding suffering and so are most often anti-natalists.

Primitive tribes might be experiencing the most consistent access to low-level happy flourishing, a perfect balance of not seeking out too much pleasure, and not worrying about small amounts of pain. So, I can see why for example to some depressed person this low level feeling of peace and tranquillity at just being able to find consistent access to small pleasures would be super appealing.

The problem is the lack of complex goals. High level cultural achievement. High level critical thinking. Replaying complex conversations one had in the day and having complex feeling about these international communications. The positive liberty to experience these things. The negative liberty not to have these experiences stripped away from you by a network of anti-tech revolutionaries.

So, by different metrics primitive society is superior, but for me it’s not.

Complex tasks are conducive to my bedrock philosophical interest to have the opportunity to experience high quality happy flourishing above all else.

**Potash:** Imagine there are two societies, one society where people do not have the ability to transform into clouds. And another where people can transform into clouds. Some people in the second society feel that transformation into a cloud is one of the most important character flourishing aspects of life, and that to not have this ability would be a deprivation of their positive liberties. But the people in the first society feel zero need to transform themselves into clouds and feel quite content with their lives as they are. There is no objective evidence as to if the ability to transform into a cloud is beneficial, and if we are worse off without it.

And so, as an objective observer, would it make sense to conclude that the people in the first society are being depraved of their positive liberties because they cannot transform themselves into clouds?

**Theo:** I wouldn’t use the word deprived as they’d be simply ignorant of that possibility, but I’d say on a metric of who has access to the most positive liberties the cloud people do yes, so it’s a superior society in my view.

**Potash:** I think I should elaborate on the cloud metaphor a little. Imagine that the people living in the first society are substantially more content and satisfied with their lives then the people living in the second society. Lets say that most of the people living in the second society do not transform themselves into clouds regularly, and that again there is no objective evidence that suggests that transforming oneself into a cloud is beneficial. Of course, those who transform themselves into clouds don’t feel that way, but they are obviously biased.

**Theo:** I don’t know, I thought in the initial way you described it, the only difference in the societies was that one could turn into clouds, and that it was a challenging task to master hence the personal testimonies of most flourishing experience of their lives, so regardless of the abstract nature of the experience, feels like it’s one positive liberty they have on the other society.

So what’s the difference now making the first society so much more contented?

**Potash:** Knowing that the people in the first society are objectively more satisfied with their lives, do you still consider the cloud bearers to be superior?

**Theo:** Ignorance that some people can master the skill of turning into clouds happens to make the first society more contented, and that’s the only difference? Probably still the cloud people are superior. Because I trust their testimony that even though they don’t have as much net contentment, they’re gaining happy flourishing that is more meaningful to them.

**Potash:** No, lets say that the mechanism which allows people to turn themselves into clouds has several reverberating effects which lead to the second society being less contented and that impacts everyone there, even those who don’t transform themselves into clouds. Does this change your answer?

**Theo:** I think by the metric of ability to achieve that high-level happy flourishing it’s superior, and if I had the choice of happening to be born into that situation I would, so long as I had hope I could work to make egalitarian access to it.

**Potash:** Now lets imagine that the people in the second society live lives that are under the control and regulation of large organizations which they are hopeless to influence. Such as the cloud company and the CSA (Cloud Safety Agency). Would you still consider the second society superior?

**Theo:** Depends if there’s a reasonable chance that people can successfully rebel against this agency whilst maintaining access to cloud mastery.

**Potash:** Lets say that these agencies are necessary for the functioning of the cloud society. Basically, what’s more important. Positive or Negative Liberty.

Would you agree that primitive societies have greater negative liberty then modern societies?

**Theo:** Yeah if there’s no reasonable hope of rebelling against the company and I just had to witness the company harming people with no ability to grow a movement to at some point stop it then I’d just prefer the society where it didn’t exist at all.

**Potash:** Would you agree that primitive societies have greater negative liberty then modern societies?

**Theo:** Probably on average yeah, compared to the average modern society today.

Though there’s a certain comradery to women and men, black and white all getting fucked by corporations, whereas it would depress me for the clan chief to be decreeing that women can’t come on the hunt, and the tribe next door are savages, etc.

**Potash:** XD c’mon man.

**Theo:** It was a mostly throwaway comment lol, I agree more negative liberty to get skilled up and run away to hunt on your own for the most part and stuff.

## B. Do the problems with modern society arise due to Technology or are they due to other factors such as Capitalism/the state/Hierarchy.

**Theo:** At what point in time do you think we lost control/opened pandora’s box?

**Potash:** Probably around the industrial revolution.

**Theo:** Good quote on technological determinism:[\[7\]](https://www.thetedkarchive.com/library/theo-slade-normandie-etc-a-collaboratively-edited-conversation-on-anti-tech-politics#fn7)

>The technological imperative is a flawed concept espoused by determinists, which states that the use of any technology is inevitable and that once a technology is in place, it is irreversible. That is, if a technology is developed, then it will eventually be used and cannot be abandoned. Gun apologists lean heavily on this imperative, refusing to acquiesce any type of firearm technologies—even those that are particularly heinous and unnecessary, such as military-grade personal weaponry, bump stocks, and armor-piercing ammunition, which have no reasonable application for civilian use. A common refrain is the slippery slope argument that gun reformists will take away all guns if given the opportunity. This would not only would be virtually impossible to accomplish (there are more than 400 million guns in the United States) but unconstitutional as well. The technological imperative of guns is the wrongful assumption that because these weapons exist, we have no choice but to accept their place in society and we mustn’t regulate them in the slightest, for this would be an infringement upon our rights.  
>  
>Contrary to the determinist’s view, however, is that we do in fact have dominion over our technologies. In his book Giving Up the Gun, Noel Perrin gives a detailed account of the sixteenth-century Japanese, who nearly abandoned all guns in their society. By this time in history, firearms were nearly ubiquitous throughout the modern world. The warrior class of Japan, however, saw long-range guns as cowardly and shameful weapons; firearms were more efficient than swords, but they “overshadow\[ed\] the men who use them.” Honor is an essential component of Japanese warrior culture, and at least for a short period of time, the use of firearms was relegated to lower-class soldiers only.  
>  
>Upper-class nobility and the samurai fought with swords and spears in hand-to-hand combat. Swordplay was regarded as a “danger-laden ballet, while a scene of extended gunplay comes out as raw violence.” Despite this virtuous resistance to firearms, the Japanese did not abandon guns entirely. By the end of the sixteenth century, invasions mounted by Korea and China reintroduced firearms back into circulation so that Japan could remain competitive on the battlefield and stave off its enemies. Afterward, guns remained highly regulated in Japan, with manufacturing only permitted by special licensure from the government. In some ways, Japan had been able to nearly quit firearms altogether, but they were dragged back into gun culture because of the need for self-preservation. Perrin closes his book by saying, “This is to talk as if progress—however one defines that elusive concept—were something semidivine, an inexorable force outside of human control. And of course, it isn’t. It is something we can guide, and direct, and even stop. Men can choose to remember; they can also choose to forget.” Still today, Japan often ranks lowest compared to other countries in terms of firearm-related deaths, and guns remain mostly irrelevant in Asian countries.

**Potash:** Technologies which have failed to make headway have done such because they are too inefficient to be used, not out of any moral self righteousness.

**Theo:** I’ve just never read a convincing argument for how technology became this monolithic self-propagating system at some stage in our history, whether industrial revolution or agricultural or whenever, there’s no clear line in the sand, we brought tech into this world, we can also regulate and arrest it’s development.

**Clay:** I fully grant that due to the way all technologically advanced societies are organized today that there are a great many people for whom it can be said that they had very little choice but to help society keep trending towards technological development. So, it’s not nearly the same as someone who’s been a hunter-gatherer all their life with a bow and arrow choosing whether to learn to use a gun.

Still, a big-tent leftist movement, and the socialist movement within it, and the anarchist movement within it can work to opportunistically strike at all the right moments in which governments and corporations are weak. And in doing so bring about the kind of world socialist revolution Ellul envisioned, which can then finish off bringing about the kind of ‘spiritual’ anti-technique revolution Ellul envisioned. Such that people only engage with technology in creative ways they desire.

**Potash:** I didn’t know you were religious.

**Theo:** Clay isn't and neither am I, but I agree with this in the broad sense of the term spiritual, acknowledging the feat of ‘consciousness moving’ it would take.

**Potash:** I didn’t know you were religious.

**Theo:** I’m not, I’m just using a broad use of the term spiritual, to acknowledge the feat of ‘consciousness moving’ it would take.

**Potash:** The idea you are propagating is a deeply religious one. Well, an idea which has its roots in the same place as religion.

**Theo:** There’s an overlap for sure.

**Potash:** Tell me, why do you think the idea of a creator has had such a profound impact on human societies? Basically every people known to man has a religion. And even plenty of people who don’t subscribe to any religion personally still believe in/are open to a creator, such as deists or agnostics.

**Theo:** I’m talking more about transcendental feeling, not belief, where for example you watch a sunset and it helps you contemplate your smallness in the universe, and so take a more stoic attitude to your problems in your life, it’s viewing your life in reflection to cosmological forces, not tribal, and not necessarily supernatural or religious.

**Potash:** That’s different. Why do you think the idea of a creator is so appealing to us?

**Theo:** Lots of factors, including that we look for patterns to help us survive, like a tiger’s tracks in the mud, but it can lead us down dumb paths like conspiracy and fundi religion too.

**Potash:** That’s true, but I think we want to believe that everything is going according to a plan and that belief doesn’t end with religion. People vastly overestimate the power ascribed to governments/people in power. For example, anything happening under a certain president is typically considered to be his fault.

People want to believe that everything goes according to a plan. That our problems arise from the wrong people being in charge, and we can solve them by putting the right people in charge.

Or in short, that the path societies take is determined by decisions more so than conditions.

And so, by default most people will absolve technology from the blame for its results. Afterall, if decisions and not conditions are the source of our problems then how could technology (conditions) be to blame? Obviously, we’ve just been “using it wrong bro”

**Theo:** I’m full of contempt for people like this, like swing voters.

But you can be pessimistic about the difficulty of shifting material conditions, and still want to vote the lesser evil people in to have some small tiny difference. It just needs to be matched with a strong grassroots movement taking action like striking and ecotage.

This is like the argument that left-anarchists are naive about human nature, left-anarchists are so worried about environmental conditions being able to ferment monsters, like the nazi party that we want to put so much care into building strong institutions that offer loads of advantages to people at a young age: [Anarchists Are Not Naive About Human Nature](https://anarchopac.com/2022/02/28/anarchists-are-not-naive-about-human-nature)

**Potash:** This has very little to do with electoral politics, that was just an example of the overall principle.

**Theo:** I know you’re talking about broader trends, but it’s your go to example for how this manifests, and I’m agreeing partially that it does manifest in that way, but it can be subverted in that case, and it can be subverted more broadly socially also.

**Potash:** Not anarchists, everyone. Even me, even qpoop, even Ted. Though I’d like to think that we do so less so than most others.

**Theo:** That sounds like the more religiously dogmatic position.

**Potash:** This is something that is intrinsic in human nature. Just as confirmation bias, everyone has it, some just less so than others.

**Theo:** No one has proved we’re way more biological determined than environmentally determined, or that that would prescribe primitivism. You’re mashing together politics, philosophy and psychology in an incoherent way.

**Potash:** There are definitely ideas which people have that have a basis in biology. Confirmation Bias is universal in humans.

**Theo:** Even if that’s the case, there’s still a massive gulf of missing premises you’d need in order to build the argument that we need to have an anti-tech revolution.

**Potash:** You’re getting too out of hand with this. All I’m saying is that we are predisposed to believe that the world is planned out, and therefore that technology plays a negligible role in determining the shape of society.

**Theo:** Meh, marxists have been around for an age worrying about tech and exploitation keeping generations enslaved on a materially determined path, anprims like Zerzan who used to be marxists just took it the next level in wanting primitive communism.

**Potash:** That was me at first. That was what I believed when I was like 13.

Political Debates in 2025 will probably just be over Woke National Bolshevism or Futurist Italian Fascism is better at beheading judeo capitalists and implanting robo cocks.

**Theo:** I’m comfortable not knowing whether I’ll ever have an impact in shifting macro material conditions, I hope a pebble I throw has a domino effect in the long-long term after I’m dead, but who knows.

The memories that make me happy are like taking a 20 year old Slovakian kid from a squat in Nottingham to the west coast of Ireland to live with a farmer for a year and doing road blockades against a dangerous gas pipeline.

woke,CapitalismVSocialism,Late Stage Capitalism Is Killing America...,"America is in the late stages of capitalism (in which the top 1% of corporations own or have stakes within 80% of the free market/ Including the housing industry, entertainment industry, pharmaceutical industry, etc) If things continue with the way things are going as of 2024, and no enforcement of the law or even changes occur that prevents corporations from buying off or owning 100s of companies & brands from the free market. The concept of capitalism as we know it, will collapse as there can never be competition between the few corporations which own everything in a country.

Housing will continue to get more expensive as more real-estate agencies continue to buy off houses under a corporation's banner of infinite profiteering.

Healthcare & medicine prices will continue to rise as 80% of the industry which is only owned by 4 corporations negotiate with ""Pharmacy Benefit Managers"" (PBMs) that only have an interest in maximizing the pockets of their own pharmaceutical Masters.

Entertainment will continue to become more & more hollow as gaming & media corporations continue to be bought out by Investment organizations like Blackrock that only have an interest in controlling these organizations through (ESG) scores that measure how ""woke"" a company is, regardless of whether they make actual good media or not.

Food across all of America will only jump in price as fast food chains & supermarkets in the industry like YUMs or Walmart continue to buy each & every one of their competitors out.

Crime rates, Suicide rates & Drug addictions will continue to reach new sky-highs as working 2 or 3 jobs just to make ends meet becomes a norm for everyday Society.As people work twice as hard, only to receive twice as less. 

Conglomerate corporations become more powerful as they have full control of not just the market. But as well as the workforce industry as a whole.

With the lack of competition between corporations, the desire to improve and innovate will be dampened. Products & services will become deeply shallow compared to when companies compete for the name of their clients.

I and many others can keep going with the symptoms that plague America, but I don't think I have to. Where already living it ""RIGHT NOW"" The steady death of capitalism is already happening. It will destroy America slowly but swiftly if nothing is done to put an end to these corporations that refuse to let go of their monopoly hold on our economy. America, as we know it today, will eventually be run & already is run by organizations whose only goal is to divide the nation with colors of deception through commercialism & social media.

The problem with America isn't Liberal or conservative (Red or Blue), it isn't the Drug epidemic that's souring through our nation, It isn't the Housing Crisis, it isn't the continually expensive medical industry that continues to get more expensive every year, it isn't the LGBT+ propaganda that we Americans are spoon-fed daily due to ESG scores that poorly misrepresents the group's actual message & identity, It isn't the great abuse of power, nor is it about gay rights, gun rights, abortion rights, or any type of rights. It's even not about which president is elected this coming year or which new congress member has been selected for none of these ""Officials"" have any actual concern for the people, for they have already been bought out by the top 1%.

The Problem with America is that the American Economy has been monopolized by the top 1% of corporations.

The fact that our government refuses to even acknowledge this monopoly hold is another problem within itself.

The Capitalistic War has been won ever since corporations like Black Rock (an American multinational investment company) managed to reach 10 TRILLION dollars worth of JUST Assets alone. To believe these corporations who have a dangerous amount of power will have the best interest of the people are those that have been lobbied to only say so. Their interest as cooperation alone is to make the most profit out of society. REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION & SYMPTOMS IT MAY CAUSE.

Our government has been bought out. For as not a single politician has ever mentioned this problem to the public. For they clearly have already been lobbied to keep the situation under the table. While others are just nearly too dumb to realize what's actually happening to our nation. For all they care about is saying what the people want to hear for that is what gets them their votes, not fixing the true problem with this economy.

We can put a stop to this, and if not, we the people of America can at least try. For I believe people would rather Fail and know that they tried, rather than Fail and know that they didn't try.

Our nation can stand as if it were Rome, A monumental nation that could last 1,000 years longer until the inevitable slow collapse. Or we can fall like how other empires have fallen, not with a bang but with a whimper that will come much more shortly than anyone can expect.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1bbf853/late_stage_capitalism_is_killing_america/,1710090301.0,1bbf853
woke,CapitalismVSocialism,People call the NAZIs socialists just to cope and try to distance themselves from NAZIs.,"Their arguments are always either “they had ‘socialist’ in their name, therefore they’re socialists,”
and, even if Hitler and the party/regime weren’t 100% transparent about how “national socialist” was just a term for Aryan supremacist, far-right politics ALWAYS involves bogus populism to appeal to the working class.
Calling yourself a socialist as part of pretending you advocate for the masses is just a natural part of the lie to include.

Idk if you guys knew this (apparently a fair amount of people don’t), but nazis are liars.

You’re just eating up nazi propaganda 80 years after the Reich fell, and Hitler is laughing at you from hell.


On another note, I live in the United States, where you get called a socialist for things like having dyed hair, generally being pro-welfare, or not being anti-LGBTQ — but if you say the working class should collectively own the means of production, an “anti-socialist” will say, “no, you actually believe [the aforementioned].)”

They’ll say that, actually, you’re an anti-white racist that wants to destroy the country with gay rights, immigration, and welfare, and it’s all because a secret cabal of “woke” Marxists infiltrated schools, Hollywood, corporations, etc… to brainwash the masses into hating white people and demanding state action to force equal misery on everyone.

Idk if you guys knew this (again, apparently a large portion of you don’t), but that’s what the original nazis believed.
Nazism is premised on exactly this conspiracy theory.

The ONLY difference between this modern “anti-woke” iteration is they designate “the woke” as their main scapegoat instead of “the Jews.” That’s a semantic difference, semantic differences are not substantive, therefore these two ideologies are fundamentally the same.

As I said in the title, them calling the nazis socialists is just a coping mechanism.
“I can’t be a nazi because I’m against socialism.”

These people are completely aware that what they are saying makes no sense and they just don’t care.

EDIT: Thought this post was shadow banned because it took forever for the first comment. Looks like I’m late to my own party.

woke,CapitalismVSocialism,"When It Comes To Communist China’s Grip On U.S. Institutions, TikTok Is Only The Beginning","There is a wide, bipartisan consensus that TikTok is effectively Chinese Communist Party spyware, which makes it an easy target for legislators and the Biden administration to ban. Keeping China away from American data, however, could easily become an excuse for the ruling class to claim they are successfully warding off infiltration from a foreign adversary without truly addressing all of the ways China has compromised our nation.

The Biden administration, Congress, states, and agencies such as the FBI agree communist China poses a grave threat to U.S. security. Action to combat these concerns in recent years, however, has largely revolved around the CCP’s weaponization of TikTok.

To put it simply, U.S. attempts to combat China’s vast infiltration campaign by simply banning TikTok is the easy out. The CCP has a grip on Americans and has stealthily tightened that grip for years. Here are other important ways communist China has embedded itself in U.S. institutions.


The Biden Family Business

The family business of President Joe Biden is sustained by overseas dealings with foreign actors including those linked to communist China. Hunter Biden and his uncle James Biden were funneled millions of dollars from companies directly influenced by the CCP to offer the “spy chief of China” legal representation. Two weeks after he traveled to communist China on his dad’s Air Force Two jet, Hunter also helped his Chinese business partners secure a deal that gave them control of a cobalt mine in Congo.

Just last year, the president sold oil from emergency reserves to the same Chinese gas giant that Hunter’s private equity firm, BHR Partners, once owned a $1.7 billion stake in.

Even if Joe wasn’t guilty of helping out his nation’s No. 1 adversary, his relationship with Hunter and the access his son acquired through his father’s status makes him guilty by proxy. Joe is susceptible to sway from Hunter’s foreign buddies including those closely linked to the CCP.


Congress

Congress is littered with legislators who are compromised by China. Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell formed a close relationship with a Chinese spy who spent years building connections with Democrats so she could send political intelligence and personal information back to communist China. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao similarly spent decades getting rich off of the Chao family’s maritime shipping company, which has deep ties to the Chinese government.
Government

In July 2022, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee revealed CCP officials compromised a Federal Reserve employee’s IT equipment and WeChat account. Unfortunately, that was not an isolated incident. Dozens of state and local governments have also fallen prey to the clutches of CCP spy campaigns.


Land

Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have raised alarms and proposed bills to stop foreign adversaries such as China from buying up U.S. territory. So far, however, those efforts have not stopped the CCP’s encroachment.

As of 2021, China owns 384,000 acres of American farmland, much of it located near U.S. military bases and other critical infrastructure, and is only increasing its control each year. Between 2009 and 2016, China’s foreign land investments grew from $300 million to $3.3 billion. In 2021, Chinese investors often linked to the CCP acquired 98 percent more U.S. land than they did between 2015 and 2019.

U.S. officials know China purchases land with malicious intent. For example, in 2017, U.S. officials uncovered CCP plans to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.


Skies

China has surveilled the U.S. using spy balloons for years. Most recently, a CCP balloon equipped with “multiple antennas” for “intelligence surveillance” completed a days-long cross-country journey above some of the nation’s most sensitive locations. It was only after that journey ended that the Biden administration opted to shoot it down.


Fentanyl Crisis

As House Republicans and witnesses demonstrated during a Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions hearing last week, the CCP is invested in increasing the presence of fentanyl in the U.S. because it destabilizes the nation and kills tens of thousands of Americans yearly.

China does this by selling and exporting the precursor chemicals required to make potent and lucrative opioids to cartels that then bring the deadly drug across the southern U.S. border. In 2022, Customs and Border Protection seized 14,700 pounds of fentanyl. That’s triple the amount it seized in 2020 and doesn’t account for the fentanyl that was not detected by border agents.


Pharmaceuticals

Speaking of precursor chemicals, the U.S. relies on China, the world’s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, for everyday generic drugs and medical equipment. A report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission in 2019 found that the Chinese government wants to exploit that dependency and become the world’s biggest producer of pharmaceutical products. 

China’s hostility further manifested in 2020 when a CCP propaganda outlet suggested the Beijing government might cut off its drug and equipment supply to Americans so the U.S. would “sink into the hell of a novel coronavirus epidemic.”


Academia

One of the most well-documented ways China infiltrates the U.S. is through academia and Confucius Institutes. These organizations, often disguised as cultural programs, are designed to expand China’s influence and allies abroad.

Instead of fighting against this part of China’s soft power campaign, the Biden administration stealthily eliminated a Trump-era proposal that required educational institutions to disclose their relationship with Confucius Institutes. Biden’s decision allowed Beijing to reopen dozens of its infiltration hubs under different names.

The administration has also largely ignored the role Chinese state actors play in exploiting the vulnerabilities in U.S. higher education. Students from China are often advised by Chinese embassies or working for China’s People’s Liberation Army.

Since 2013, the Chinese government also has been the largest source of foreign donations to U.S. universities, and since 2011, Chinese sources have participated in donations or contracts worth more than $426 million to U.S. universities.


Intellectual Property

Because of its successful infiltration into higher education, China places spies in front-row seats to some of our nation’s most promising technology and innovation. The CCP’s desire to beat Americans’ grip on the global economy, and its access to the U.S. institutions developing useful tools, resulted in the theft of dozens of trade, military, engineering, and intelligence secrets.

The Department of Justice estimates that “80 percent of all economic espionage prosecutions” it brings “would benefit the Chinese state.”


Sports

It’s no secret China pays the National Basketball Association in return for American basketball coaches and players’ silence on the communist government’s human rights violations.

In recent years, China successfully convinced NBA officials to shut up employees and hamper players’ freedom to speak out on issues including the Hong Kong protests and Uyghur genocide.

China’s grip on the association is so tight that even the NBA coaches who host basketball camps in the communist country admitted the CCP’s influence meant they were essentially “working for the Chinese government.”
Electric Vehicles

China is responsible for “70 to 80 percent of the world’s battery chemicals, battery anodes and battery cells” which means it essentially controls the electric vehicle supply chain. As the Biden administration and its Democrat allies push toward requiring Americans to use electric cars over gas-powered ones, China’s grip on the global battery market will only tighten.

Similarly, the communist country’s monopoly on rare earth minerals and metals means the CCP controls not just the materials required for “green technology” but also “modern-day weapons systems.”


Wall Street

For years now, the CCP has used willing Wall Street firms to leverage its financial influence within the U.S. and around the world. This collusion not only sustains the human rights violator but also compromises “tens of millions of unwitting American investors in the process.” U.S. firms build woke capital on the back of the CCP which, in turn, gets billions of American dollars.
Other Big Tech Companies

China has “courted and seduced many powerful people in America’s tech industry to willingly, and sometimes enthusiastically” advance the communist country’s goal of technological supremacy.

Facebook, Google, Apple, and Elon Musk’s Tesla all cater to the CCP’s wishes.


Hollywood

Despite its extensively reported penchant for wokeness, Hollywood is all too willing to censor its productions to stay in the good graces of communist China to preserve overseas profits. The CCP’s ability to control what hits screens is just another way China exports its authoritarian ideology to the world.


Media

China not only runs propaganda but also employs the help of American corporate media outlets such as The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, and Bloomberg, which have built cozy relationships with Chinese officials.

The compromising nature of these ties became especially prominent beginning in 2020 when the propaganda press helped the CCP spread lies about the origins of Covid-19.

Pretty much every major U.S. institution is ripe for reforms that would root out foreign influences like China. If the U.S. government is serious about combatting China’s sway, a ban on TikTok should signal the beginning, not the end, of a war on China’s infiltration of American systems. 


Banning TikTok should signal the beginning, not the end, of a war on China’s infiltration of U.S. institutions.

woke,CapitalismVSocialism,Unpacking the notion of a single centralized “elite.”,"I find that most people I talk to agree that real power in the United States is largely concentrated in the hands of a very select few; namely a few dozen billionaires, a few dozen megacorporations, and the lobbying agencies that influence politicians on their behalf. Even _The Simpsons_ made a joke about “thanking our new corporate overlords” after their acquisition by Disney. Views on what exactly that corporate control means, or how it came to be, however, seem to wildly differ.

The right-wing either uncritically supports that kind of social stratification, peddles in conspiracy theories about a secret Satanic world order, or conflates “woke” left-wing activist movements with the companies that pander to those movements because they bother to do market research. They oppose scientific empiricism, multiculturalism, and nuance of any kind, on the grounds that it all represents nothing more than _panem et circenses._

My fellow left-wingers also seem to fall prey to the idea that a singular, united elite runs all of society. They seem to see the facade of “polite society” and handshake-laden news conferences and think they’re all in cahoots with one another, rather than at each others’ throats, competing for the top.

This comes up when topics like education and abortion that affect wide swaths of society come up, alongside comments like “the rich don’t want an educated, well-off population. They want you stupid, compliant, and dependent.”

This certainly seems in line with Reagan’s comments about the dangers of an “educated proletariat,” but contradicts the ideas of proponents of demand-side economics like Joe “nothing will fundamentally change” Biden; who seems to believe that a healthy, educated, well-off populace is in the interests of an elite that desires to maintain control for very long - which while a fascinating idea seems to neither jibe well with my perception of the behaviour of the billionaire class, nor even made a dent in the public perception of capitalism.

I don’t believe that capitalism is a sustainable economic system for much longer, and would best be overthrown before it locks in even more catastrophic climate change. That being said, given how entrenched capitalist thinking is at all levels in our society, I believe its ideas should be both engaged with in good faith and rejected accordingly. 

Another thing that comes with this is asking how the bourgeoisie, as Marx framed it, relates to the American conception of the “middle class.”

Marx seemed to make no distinction between the capitalist ultra-elite and the more broadly upwardly mobile, given they share the same interests in status and accumulation. In his model, there wouldn’t be an upper, middle, and working class; just the bourgeoisie and proletariat (and lumpenproletariat when you’re feeling especially misanthropic.) This is challenged IMO when politicians and Ivy League students continually state that they believe the median income in the US is around $200,000 annually. That alone indicates a certain level of insulated disconnect from what is commonly understood as the middle class.

The less overtly socialist populists (read: white people who don’t particularly like “wokeness,” or identify with/understand communism) but like George Carlin, Michael Moore, Chris Hedges, Ralph Nader, and Jimmy Dore) seem to view the modern “elite” in a similar light to the aristocracy of old - not viewing it as a distinct social class, that has overt representation in government in the UK with the House of Lords (relative to America where corruption and bribery understood to be the mechanism of influencing government towards the interests of the rich, not the structure of the government itself (the stacked deck that is the Senate and Electoral College are another matter entirely)) and potentially overlooking the fundamental difference in how they acquired their position in society; or how recently in history ownership came into the hands of merchants instead of nobles.",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/yef28x/unpacking_the_notion_of_a_single_centralized_elite/,1666834766.0,yef28x
woke,CapitalismVSocialism,Cancel Culture Is Helping Marxists Achieve Their Revolution in the West Without the Bloodshed,"Cancel culture is sometimes mistaken as the central problem in the life of the West. Cancel culture, however, is merely a tool, the enforcement mechanism with which the woke left retains the cultural territory it has conquered.

The central problem facing citizens of Western countries is that a very hardcore, Marxian left has scored significant victories in its steady march toward the takeover of cultural institutions. This is a strategy first thought up by an Italian, Antonio Gramsci, who co-founded Italy’s Communist Party in 1921.

Gramsci taught Marxists that, to achieve Karl Marx’s goal of abolishing private property, the family, the church, and the nation state, they did not need the bloody revolution that Marx had also called for. In Western countries, with their rich civil societies, it was better to infiltrate the cultural institutions, take them over, and indoctrinate the people into abandoning their love for family, nation, etc., which Gramsci called “false consciousness.”

Indoctrination would raise their consciousness. This led to struggle sessions, which had harrowing results from China to the fields of Cambodia to the West in the 21st century.

Marxism needed coercion, despotism, and outright terror from the start, and Marx called for all three. In 1848, Marx spelled this out in his essay “The Victory of the Counter-Revolution in Vienna,” where he wrote, “There is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.”

In our Western societies, state coercion of free speech must be presented in less truculent a fashion. This is why Herbert Marcuse, the Frankfurt School neo-Marxist who did so much to promote critical theory and the sexual revolution in the United States, came out with something called—we kid not—“Repressive Tolerance.”

In a 1969 essay by that name, Marcuse wrote that “In this society … false consciousness has become the general consciousness—from the government down to its last objects. The small and powerless minorities which struggle against the false consciousness and its beneficiaries must be helped: their continued existence is more important than the preservation of abused rights and liberties which grant constitutional powers to those who oppress these minorities.”

Marcuse then called for the “withdrawal of tolerance from regressive movements before they can become active; intolerance even toward thought, opinion, and word, and finally, intolerance in the opposite direction, that is, toward the self-styled conservatives, to the political Right—these anti-democratic notions respond to the actual development of the democratic society which has destroyed the basis for universal tolerance.”

That was cancel culture in its germinal stage. What it does is prevent the retaking of ground lost to the left.

That doesn’t mean it is less of a danger. When people’s lives are canceled, they can lose their freedom of expression, their ability to make a living, and sometimes even their friends. When you have been totally canceled, Franz Kafka becomes your best friend, for only that turn-of-the-20th-century master of the absurd can make sense of your henceforth Kafkaesque existence.

That this fate can lurk around the corner in the free West is something that should concern us all and give us the encouragement we need to fight cancel culture in every way we can. We should expose it for what it is, decry it when it happens, and also summon the courage not to repeat a lie because saying the truth may result in our own canceling.

An area where people have become very cautious of late has been transgender issues. To say that a person can never become a woman, and vice versa, can get you thrown out of polite society, virtual or physical. And yet, most of us know that no matter how many puberty blockers a person takes, or how many healthy organs are mutilated, a man cannot menstruate, conceive, etc.

The transgender issue is smack in the middle of the culture wars in America. There are many willing to take a stand and say, “No, I won’t live by lies.” Cancel culture is the left’s instrument to force them to do so.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/vzwrx3/cancel_culture_is_helping_marxists_achieve_their/,1657912653.0,vzwrx3
woke,CapitalismVSocialism,Stop Considering Yourself As An Employee,"This may not fit into the category of ""debating Capitalism & Socialism"" but I am sure it will spark debate non-the-less. It is also something more people need to consider. 

In our current economy (I speak only of America but I am pretty sure other countries would also qualify here) there is no point in looking at one's self as an ""employee.""

Lot's of people like to talk about how companies don't care about their employees anymore and how much of what used to be provided by companies has been shifted to employees (think pension vs 401K). 

So, embrace that. 

It doesn't matter if you like it or not if it is simply the way things are. 

Stop thinking of yourself as an employee and start thinking of yourself as a business. 

Why do this? 

Because it will change how you perceive your personal situation and make it line up closer to reality.

Think about something you have a subscription to; Netflix, cable, cell phone, Amazon Prime, housekeeper, chauffeur , etc.   
Now, if you woke up tomorrow and decided that Netflix or Amazon Prime added no value to your life what would you do? 

You would cancel it. 

Well, you need to recognize the reality that you are only valuable to your customer(s) if you are actually being valuable and the moment you are not valuable you should be cut loose, just like you would do to poor Netflix. 

Mindset shift 2: 

Your only ever going to be paid based on the market value of your skill set. 

No one cares how long you have worked at a specific location, no one cares how ""hard"" you work, it only matters if you are providing value. In fact, it only matters if you are providing more value than the alternatives. 

Think about it, have you ever gone to a professional service provider for a long period of time?   
Let's say you blew out your back and had to see a Chiropractor for years, while you might expect his costs to go up over time thanks to inflation would you be OK with the Chiropractor telling you that since you had been his long term customer he was raising the price on you by 20%? Of course not, you would find a new Chiropractor. Service providers, and companies in general, tend to give long term customers discounts or other types of perks. 

Consider yourself a service provider.

But what if you don't make very much money?   
Well, you need to learn a skill set that is more in demand (compared to supply). 

Mindset Shift 3: 

Multiple customers or just 1? 

Running a business where you are beholden to just 1 customer is a risky business. If that customer drops you then you are out of business. Well, in the same way you only working for 1 customer/employer is risky. 

Now, it is perfectly reasonable to weigh the pros and cons and decide the fragility of working for one customer is worth the risk but it would behoove you to weigh those pros and cons and see for yourself. It may be time to get more customers.

That is enough for this experimental post. Looking forward to feedback and the obligatory ""this is why capitalism is evil, it commodifies people"" comments.

If you think one of those mindset shifts doesn't reflect reality I would love to hear why.",85,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/etjdcr/stop_considering_yourself_as_an_employee/,1579912274.0,etjdcr
woke,CapitalismVSocialism,"Capitalists, is there any reason to be afraid of or debate communists, as it seems the system is designed that communism will never happen?","For a little while, I afraid of communism. It wasn’t on over-arching fear that dominated my every waking moment, but just a thing in the back of my mind. I don’t define myself so precisely as many of the others in the group do, I don’t know if I’m a libertarian, or a traditional liberal, or whatever label. I know that I lean to the left and many things, but I also recognize the things that the left can get wrong. I went to college, and a had a few professors who were a bit marxists, but I never fully drank the cool-aid so to speak, and there wasn’t really a Reddit at that time for college students to go to and regurgitate the pseudo-intellectualism they took in that week, posing as authority figures on a subject that they believe explains why so few have so much more than them, and why they have to work and sacrifice to get what they want. In truth, they are only passing off others ideas, ideas they have thought about deeply in how ideal they are, but never truly questioned in either actual practice or experience. Those college students, no matter how woke they are at the moment, know nothing of the reality of the extreme poverty of the world or how the economic systems function. They use fallacies of arguments to try to prove their point. This takes the form of pointing at the starving and asking why they starve in capitalism when less people are starving now than ever. The same with the sick, the unemployed. Truth is the world, as a whole is better for more people now than it ever has been for anyone. No poor person of any level at any place in the world would trade the poverty of now for the poverty of 100 years ago.

My fear stemmed from being an individual who came from nothing and became successful. I had no silver spoon, no trust fund, no leg up on life. I simply made good choices, worked really hard for a really long time, sacrificed my time and happiness in the immediate for a better tomorrow, and took chances. And it worked. This college dropout who at 19 was stealing in order to eat and blamed everyone else for his life is now in the 1%. It wasn’t easy, and honestly a lot of people can’t do it. It isn’t because of the system per say, it’s more of the player. Like anyone can play basketball, but if you are taller, or if you train for longer, or if you are born with natural talent, you just play better and are more successful. I get, in that regard, why some people who simply can’t be successful can be angry and feel they are owed or entitled. Even though it is masked as concern for the greater good, it is truly about themselves. So I had a fear that more and more people are going to college, and taking liberal arts and gender studies where they learn concepts and theories of patriarchy and how everything is the fault of or in the control of either men or white men or the rich etc. My fear is that everything I did to provide for myself and my family would be taken away but those who didn’t go through what I did, didn’t earn it, and leave my family and I starving as what tends to happen in communist revolutions.  Again, not a “I can’t sleep at night fear” but a concern none the less.

I don’t have that fear anymore. I had an epiphany as many of the highly competent people tend to have. I don’t make that last comment in hubris, or as bragging of my own intelligence, but I state it as it relates to the matter at hand. The reason I don’t worry about communism anymore, and I never will again, and why i’m going to unsubscribe from subs like this, is I realized no revolution will ever happen. Revolutions are carried on by the charismatic leaders that are competent and high functioning, responsible and productive, leaders who take responsibility and can truly sacrifice. They also have the will to act. Thing is, all of those traits are rewarded in a capitalist society. So the people who could truly lead or start a revolution, the ones that could actually truly do it, even if they think in the way of believing the communist rhetoric and paradigm, they get immediately co-opted by capitalism. I’m sure communist have their mouth pieces, leaders of the movement who are respected, but by pragmatic nature, they are not of the same quality of leadership or competence to which I’m suggesting. They are most likely only leaders and stars in their position because, in a capitalist view, those are the best and brightest of the bunch who, with respect, are not good enough to compete in the actual capitalist world and be successful. Think of them as minor league players who would never make it to the majors.

I tried to rack my brain for an analogy to this, something that would explain the idea better than I could. Only thing I could think of is the Black Mirror episode “15 million merits”. If you haven’t seen it, it’s about a world where most people work shitty jobs underground bicycling to generate power used by the minority of people who live up above. You can see how it’s a perfect analogy. The workers get merits for their cycling which they spend on crap, porn, games, etc. However, if you save your merits and don’t indulge, you can buy your way onto a reality show where you can show a talent that can get you your own show and therefore you get to rise above. This could be an analogy of starting a business or getting a degree. Anyways, main character, the girl he likes ends up moving up by agreeing to do porn, and he’s upset. He gave her all his merits so that she could get out, but she ended up not being as talented as she imagined and instead of going back to the bikes, decided to do porn instead. He busts ass to get enough merits again to go on the show himself, and once there he threatens to kill himself to shock the audience into how horrible the system is. He’s earned and saved all this money twice over, concocted a plan to put and end to the show that all these people work and save to get on, and is enacting his plan at the expected loss of his own life. However, what happens is the panel recognizes how he is different and all the good qualities about him, and instead of offing himself to make a blow to the system, he ends up going above the surface with his own show where he complains about things with the same sharp object at his throat. By dynamic action, he found himself at the cross roads where he was fighting for the all so all could be better, but his plan and effort was so good that instead he received recognition and was offered success, and he chose success. I truly believe that in life, this is what happens to communists of any true competence, after college they apply their skills and work ethic in the real world, and once they see that it can be rewarded, recognized, and cultivated, they abandon the socialist cause because at that point they can’t argue that once you apply yourself and take responsibility for yourself and work hard and make good choices, capitalism works.

So I no longer have any fear, and other capitalist on here that argue or debate, I say don’t waste your time.  It will all sort itself out. Even if capitalism is evil and the worst thing ever, it is still impossible to beat because the strangest challengers will always join. This is my epiphany but that doesn’t mean someone else already hasn’t thought this before. I would love to know if it is a previously existing theory, and if others have input.  I guess the question I have, if any, is that isn't even debating with communists, given this paradigm, is pointless right?

woke,CapitalismVSocialism,The What If's for Conservatives," I have a few questions for conservatives on this Memorial Day. What if our foreign policy of the past century is deeply flawed and has not served our national security interests? What if we wake up one day and realize that the terrorist threat is a predictable consequence of meddling in the affairs of others and has nothing to do with us being free and prosperous ? What if the propping up repressive regimes in the Middle East endangers both the United States and Israel? What if occupying countries like Iraq and Afghanistan and bombing Pakistan is directly related to the hatred directed toward us? What if some day it dawns on us that losing over 13,700 American military personnel and contractors in the Middle East since 9/11 is not a fair trade\-off for the loss of nearly 3,000 American citizens no matter how many Iraqi, Pakistani and Afghan people are killed or displaced. What if we finally decide that torture even if called enhanced interrogation is self\-destructive and produces no useful information and that contracting it out to a third world nation is just as evil? What if it is finally realized that war and military spending is always destructive to the economy? What if all wartime spending is paid for through the deceitful an evil process of inflating and borrowing? What if we finally see that wartime conditions always undermine personal liberty? What if conservatives who preach small government finally realize that our interventionist foreign policy provides the greatest incentive to expand the government? What if conservatives understood once again that their only logical position is to reject military intervention and managing an empire throughout the world? What if the American people woke up and understood that the official reasons for going to war are almost always based on lies and promoted by war propaganda in order to serve special interests? What if we as a nation came to realize that the quest for Empire eventually destroys all great nations. What if Trump has no intention of leaving Syria? What if a military draft is being planned for for the wars that will spray out if our foreign policy has not changed? What if the American people learn the truth that our foreign policy has nothing to do with national security, that it never changes from one administration to the next? What if war and preparation for war is a racket serving the special interests? What if President Trump is completely wrong about Venezuela and it turns  out worse than Iraq and Vietnam put together? What if Christianity actually teaches peace and not preventive wars of aggression? What if diplomacy is found to be superior to bombs and bribes in protecting America? What happens if my concerns are completely unfounded, nothing, but what happens if my concerns are justified?

libtard,CapitalismVSocialism,[All] Why I'm a Capitalist Pt 5: The Point Of This Series (And Why I'm Sorry),"PREFACE: I get that this isn't a traditional debate post, but I felt this was important to post here anyway since it will affect how I write later debate posts in the future. Plus, where is a debate without introspection?

When I set out to create this series, I forgot why I even did so. It eventually became another ""lets argue against socialists unproductively"" chain with no real purpose. Besides the silly tone, it really wasn't offering much, and it began to lose steam, mostly because I was getting tired of writing this stuff. What was said has already been said, not only by me but by tons of others. So I decided to look back on why I even made this.

Frankly, I'm not sure. I started this some time ago and I can't find out why now, and I won't pretend to. But after my last post, something kept nagging me. I had a point to make with this series, but what was that point? That capitalism is wholesome 100 big chungus? I don't even like capitalism that much.

I then found an old message history with another user, who will remain anonymous. Perhaps he isn't the reason why I started this, but he will be the reason I continue this because this interaction is something that I have found more enlightening than any other interaction that I've ever had.

Note: Background and Discussion are not necessary for understanding this post. You can jump to reflection.

# Background

I'm a subscriber of /r/PoliticalCompassMemes, and I frequently watch liberal YouTubers. I don't often hang out in the demonstrably left or right-wing circles because they end up feeling really unfun. I frequent here because you guys engage in debate and it's fun to scroll by watching people at least try to convince each other and to feel like there's a least a pretense of civility, debate, and trust in your fellow man. But holy hell the avidly political subreddits are just **mean**. Like, dude, I get it, you don't like the United States or Capitalism on the left or Muslims and ""Libtards"" on the right. Doesn't mean that you should post twitter screenshots 20 times a day engaged in a constant circlejerk about how the world is horrible and that people should die.

The user in question who I found I only found because of /r/PoliticalCompassMemes. He was an avid participant in left-wing circles, and holy hell he was ANGRY. And I don't mean he sometimes did flareup posts where he said that everyone should go to hell, I mean every day had only flareup posts where he said everyone should go to hell. I don't have a problem with anger (well actually I do cause who likes being around angry people having an episode) but I felt something was wrong. I don't think it's natural or healthy to go on angry tirades against people every single day. I especially felt wrong with comments like these:

> All the ""lib lefts"" over at pcm are just reactionaries. No one can change my mind. The whole sub is a cess pit of misinformed and ignorance.

FYI: For /r/PoliticalCompassMemes, LibLefts are hugely varied, ranging from pot-smokers to revolutionary anarchists, and hardly the type I would call reactionary. The reactionary stereotype would apply to the AuthRight, often a subject of mockery due to their inconsistency.

So, I found someone who just made strange and angry comments, some of which targeted a community that I was a part of. Some of the comments were wrong, but the strangeness of each one is what made me want to DM him.

# The Discussion

I began the discussion quite poorly, basically attacking his communication strategy. In short, he circlejerked, a lot, and I was asking why he didn't try to approach others. I also asked why when he did approach others, why he decided to be dismissive and insulting (my favorite moment was when he called someone pro-gun an ""ammosexual""). It took me a few paragraphs to get to the point of why I was DMing him at all.

> When debating people, it's not good to be so vindictive and unsympathetic. It's always best to understand your opponent completely, to the point of being able to see their ideas and credibly believe you could hold them, given enough reason or emotion.

His response was less than encouraging.

> "" i just want to be left alone"". This is exactly why the Germans supported the Nazis. Adolph Hitler told the German people that Jews and communists were coming to take away their rights. The Gernans were convinced that Jews and communists would take away their guns and free speech. They wanted Hitler to protect their rights.

> It is all in this book-

> https://www.amazon.com/They-Thought-Were-Free-Germans/dp/0226511928

I should note that this guy loved quoting books and authors. He even got banned off of /r/AskHistorians because they have a rule against book quoting. I only say this to convey how much he does it; it's truly remarkable.

I got quite confused initially by this response because I never said ""I just want to be left alone"" and the rest of his comment was a mess. ""They wanted Hitler to protect their rights.""? No they wanted the extermination of the Jewish race and the pride of the Aryan race restored. Did the Weimar Republic even have gun rights at the time? I later came to realize that he wasn't actually responding to me but someone else, and that he accidentally responded to my DM, though he only told me when I gave my next reply.

> ""I just want to be left alone"" is indeed a phrase quoted by many libertarians and ancaps as an emotional summary of their position. However the circumstances of modern America and post-WW1 Germany are wildly different, and so are the political positions...My bet is that the entire libertarian movement, and therefore these statements, stems from distrust or frustration towards government bureaucracy.

It was after this point that I started to get an understanding of this user. After a soft back and forth where he said he needed to think for a bit, he came back with this:

> Ok, first, I have an anarcho capitalist stalker who contacted me while drunk on Facebook. Plus, they make fun of me and twist my words around over in subs such as r/Shitstatistssay

> That is why I use facts. They have trouble with facts.

I think this is him justifying the constant quoting, which I criticized earlier, and made me theorize something. I assumed, and he later confirmed, that he likely has problems with libertarians in his own life, not only on Facebook but also family and friends, and that he uses social media to balance this out and let off steam. But that leads to further questions because of what he says next:

> The United States Libertarian Movement is grounded in authoritarianism and fascism. The KKK supported Libertarian Barry Goldwater in 1964, because he was against the government of the Great Society programs of LBJ. The kkk were opposed to the Great Society programs for Libertarian reasons.

> The Tea Party and Glenn Beck have made it so that tens of millions of Americans identify with the fake freedumb and liburty of the Libertarian Movement.

> 60 million dumb Americans identify with the corporate sponsored, fake freedumb and liburty of the Libertarian Bowel Movement.

> Ludwig von Mises was a fascist policy writer for the dictatorship of Engelbert Dollfuss. Friedrich von Hayek worked for the Austrofascists too. Von Mises and von Hayek got their anti rent control policies from Italian fascist Alberto de Stefani.

> Libertarians Milton Friedman and Tom Sowell also support Nazi privatization of the economy.

> Augusto Pinochet privatized the economy of Chile after Salvador Allende had nationalized it. The CIA helped privatization Chile and dozens of other nations. 

If this man has constant contact with libertarians, why does he keep getting their ideas wrong, demonizing them, and confusing them with authoritarians? Previously you could make the argument that bigoted people are only bigoted because they don't know any better, but this guy should know better. What's going on?

My hypothesis and this is a hypothesis I'm only generating now, is that despite being around tons of libertarians, he never actually talks to them, probably because he hates them. With no knowledge of the libertarians around him, all he knows is what he gets from people who also hate libertarians. In this, hate doesn't come from a lack of understanding, lack of understanding comes from hate. However, this is simply armchair psychology, and I have little information to draw upon with personal correspondence, so it's a hypothesis that will remain untested.

I do have a favorite statement from his reply, though

> The kkk were opposed to the Great Society programs for Libertarian reasons.

No I think they were opposed because the great society promoted equality and the KKK was racist.

We continued this back and forth for a little bit, until it came to a screeching halt. I brought up that guilt by association is never a good argument, citing that the Nazis practiced their own welfare policy. I argued that even if the Nazis supported a policy, that does not make that policy automatically bad (to be fair they weren't known for supporting many good policies). After about two DMs back and forth, he replied with this:

> Why did you have such trouble understanding that fascists made the welfare state smaller? Is it be the you cant tell state from nation? Is it because you think state and gubmint are the same thing? I'm ready to block you. Your self righteousness reminds me of my Christian conservative family.

And so he did block me.

# Reflection

In retrospect, I'm not sure what I expected. My approach was very flawed, the dude was blindingly hateful of libertarians, and I wasn't careful with my statements. However, after I was blocked, I felt kinda sad. Cutting off communications is not a light gesture, and I thought we were hitting it off in some small way.

Recently, I've had nothing but time to think about my own politics, politics in general, and people. I had come to realize something rather heavy: The hate I accuse others of having is hate that I too had possessed. I had my own hate that was driving me to a nonunderstanding of political positions I don't support, as well as distancing myself from my close friends. When I realized this, well it wasn't fun. Letting go of hate for me isn't the hard part, it's realizing what I hated and the fact that I hated at all. When I thought over and over, this discussion between me and this other user cropped up.

When I was in DMs with him, my concern for his health and well-being was secondary to another objective: I wanted to defend the tribe of PCM and win a political debate first and foremost. Even if well-being became more prominent of an objective, it was still secondary. Perhaps this is ultimately why I failed: You can't care for someone and wish them well when your primary motivation is hate.

So, what about this series?

Well, I fucked up, and kept fucking up. All of my posts are not designed to promote a greater understanding of Capitalism in the reader. Rather, they were designed to attack socialism and socialists. I made no attempt at understanding or making my opponents understand. They were ineffective and became drab. The only difference was that I tried to be silly about it, but it's hard to be silly under these circumstances.

So, I'm sorry. My old posts were crap and only contributed to a problem I was seeking to solve, that being a nonunderstanding of capitalists held by socialists. I hope this can be forgiven.

I don't wish to fuck up any longer though. I may continue this series and let the title make more sense. I want people to understand why I'm a Capitalist, not try to convert socialists to Capitalism. If I can make even one person abandon their hatred of Capitalists, then I would have done my job.

If you've read this far, thank you. If you hang out in political circles while are dominantly of one political opinion, I recommend branching out to others for your own sake. If you don't hear the other side, you'll come to misunderstand and ultimately hate them, something I would wish upon nobody.

Have a good day everyone.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/nayfza/all_why_im_a_capitalist_pt_5_the_point_of_this/,1620851031.0,nayfza
traitor,CapitalismVSocialism,Socialism and Communism are fundamentally flawed systems and no alternative to Capitalism,"Now many Communists talk a lot about how communism is such a great thing. While I think everyone can agree that capitalism has some problems communism as a system turns out in all aspects to be even worse.

In communism we see a total removal of incentives creating a system where ""We pretend to Work and they pretend to pay"". The truth is that collectivisation has intentionally slowed production in all countries leading to mass starvation. For example we read:   
""A Soviet article in March 1975 found that 27% of the total value of Soviet agricultural produce was produced by privately farmed plots despite the fact that they only consisted of less than 1% of arable land (approximately 20 million acres), making them roughly 40 times more efficient than collective farms.""  
In fact it would take till 1940 for agriculture to reach pre collectivised levels and we would see starvation throughout the state in this period for example during 1932 in the Holdomor. Similar events happened in china under Mao with the Great Leap Forward.  
Similarly you have Socialists who argue that Socialism destroys Inequality. On the other hand we see that under socialist states those in government or bureaucracy end up becoming greedy and start using their power to boster inequality.  
For example in the Soviet Union the government and bureacracy had special access to luxury goods and clothing. The children of the nomenklatura were sent to elite schools and universities and could travel to other countries. They were also given access to foreign currency and also had exclusive foreign travel privileges. Ordinary people couldn't even hold foreign cash or travel to other countries (something we can do in capitalism) while the leaders fully did it. Infact you specifically saw that the Soviet leaders didn't invest in OGAS while the US did in ARPANET. Infact the US government was fearful of soviet advancement until they realised that the Soviets had basically not invested because their Statistical department feared that it would drive them obsolete so they cut funding. Here we see a great case of Planned Obsoloscence carried out by the Socialist Leaders.  
However despite the many failings of Socialism and Communism, people still haven't rejected this system.For example you have the case of New Harmony a socialist community where people worked without incentive which in the end failed to last a year.  
[https://www.maciverinstitute.com/perspectives/the-failed-socialist-state-in-midwestern-america](https://www.maciverinstitute.com/perspectives/the-failed-socialist-state-in-midwestern-america)

On the hand Capitalism, has singlehandedly moved billions out of poverty. After reform China has seen an economic miracle, with an average annual growth rate of 10% from 1978 to 2005. And a more than tenfold increase.  
[China Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_and_opening_up#:~:text=Since%20the%20beginning%20of%20Deng,the%20height%20of%20Maoist%20policies)

Same is seen in India which nationalised banks created liscence raj to basically stifle capitalism. They would declare themselves as a totally socialist state. However following the fall of the USSR, India would reform leading to huge growth and from 1992 to 2005, their foreign investment would increase by 316.9%, and India's GDP would grow from $266 billion in 1991 to $2.3 trillion in 2018. You saw a billion people leaving poverty in both nations.   
Similarly in Poland we saw a great rebound in their economy after the fall with Poland's GDP growing nearly eightfold between 1990 and 2018. Infact many experts believe that in the coming years Poland can take a more dominating role in the EU with their growth.

The tech revolution of today and the advances in medicine (while the soviets followed Lysenkoism) are all boons of capitalism. Capitalism allows people individual freedom by giving people the freedom to choose where they work, what they buy, and how they spend their money. On the other hand the Socialist government shut down all dissenting Opinion to itself. For example, if I said FDR was bad in the 1930s i the USA then I would certainly not be taking a fundamental risk to my life. And yet imagine saying the same in the USSR about Stalin in 1930s. Infact we dont need to imagine, we have the case of Osip Mandelstam who said in a satirical poem that Stalin had ""cockroach mustaches"", he was sent to a labor camp, where he died from **exhaustion and hunger.** Or you have a fellow socialist, Nikolai Bukharin who was original revolutionary and supporter of Lenin and was close even to Stalin. However he made the mistake of disagreeing on policy with Stalin and lo and behold he was accused of being a traitor and executed in the Great purge. Casual Jokes about Stalin had a chance of getting you sent to the Gulag in the USSR and yet many call socialism as a great system.  
I think a fundamental symptom of socialism's flaws is the case of Lysenkoism where the soviet government intentionally funded pseudo scientific principles which led to famines and starvation.   


>In fact more than 3,000 mainstream biologists were dismissed or imprisoned, and numerous scientists were executed in the Soviet campaign to [suppress scientific opponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressed_research_in_the_Soviet_Union). The president of the Soviet Agriculture Academy, [Nikolai Vavilov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Vavilov), who had been Lysenko's mentor, but later denounced him, was sent to prison and died there, while Soviet genetics research was effectively destroyed.

  
Now there are some talk about environmental issues under Capitalism, for this I would only ask them to read about the various soviet programs such as the drying of the Aral Sea and the fact that the USSR up to its collapse in 1991 **1.5 times as much pollution per unit of GNP as the United States**. 

Overall Socialism and communism are systems that lead to brutality, inefficiencies, state surveillance and shutting down of all dissent. To me, capitalism certainly has its flaws however Socialism is an alternative to capitalism as potassium cyanide is an alternative to water.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1jme1cz/socialism_and_communism_are_fundamentally_flawed/,1743220912.0,1jme1cz
traitor,CapitalismVSocialism,On This Day in Socialist History: Fanny Kaplan Shoots Vladimir Lenin's Ass,"On August 30, 1918, Fanny Efimovna Kaplan shot Vladimir Lenin’s ass.

She became a political revolutionary at an early age and joined a socialist group, the Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs). In 1906, when she was 16 years old, Kaplan was arrested in Kiev over her involvement in a terrorist bomb plot. She was captured after a bomb she and her romantic partner were working on accidentally exploded. She served in the Maltsev and Akatuy prisons of Nerchinsk katorga, Siberia, where she lost her sight, which was partially restored later. She was released on March 3, 1917, after the February Revolution overthrew the imperial government. As a result of her imprisonment, Kaplan suffered from continuous headaches and periods of blindness.  


Kaplan became disillusioned with Lenin in 1917-1918, due to conflict between the SRs and the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks had strong support in the soviets, but in the November 1917 elections to the Constituent Assembly, non-Bolsheviks were the majority. When the Assembly met in January 1918, a Socialist Revolutionary was elected president. The Bolsheviks responded by dissolving the Constituent Assembly. By August 1918, the Bolsheviks had banned most other parties. Most recently, they had banned the Left Socialist Revolutionaries (Left SRs), formerly the Bolsheviks' main coalition partners, who had rebelled against them in July in opposition to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Kaplan decided to assassinate Lenin because she considered him ""a traitor to the Revolution.”

On August 30, 1918, Lenin spoke at the Hammer and Sickle, an arms factory in southern Moscow. As Lenin left the building and before he had entered his car, Kaplan called out to him. When Lenin turned towards her, she fired three shots with a FN M1900 pistol. One bullet passed through Lenin's coat, and the other two struck him. One passed through his neck, punctured part of his left lung, and stopped near his right collarbone; the other lodged in his left shoulder. 

Despite the severity of his injuries, Lenin survived, but his health never fully recovered from the attack. It has been speculated that the shooting contributed to the strokes that incapacitated and eventually killed him 6 years later.

After her arrest, during her interrogation by the Cheka, she made the following statement:  


>My name is Fanya Kaplan. Today I shot Lenin. I did it on my own. I will not say from whom I obtained my revolver. I will give no details. I had resolved to kill Lenin long ago. I consider him a traitor to the Revolution. I was exiled to Akatuy for participating in an assassination attempt against a Tsarist official in Kiev. I spent 11 years at hard labour. After the Revolution, I was freed. I favoured the Constituent Assembly and am still for it.

The Kaplan attempt and the Moisei Uritsky assassination was used by the government of Soviet Russia for the reinstatement of the capital punishment, which had been abolished by the Russian Provisional Government in March 1917. Because of course the rules change when you go after The Really Important Socialists.  


Kaplan referenced the Bolsheviks' growing authoritarianism, citing their forcible shutdown of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, the elections to which they had lost. When it became clear that Kaplan would not implicate any accomplices, she was executed in Alexander Garden.  

An official decree announcing the Red Terror was issued only hours after the Kaplan shooting and called for an ""all-out struggle against enemies of the revolution"". In the next few months, about 800 Right SRs and other political opponents of Bolsheviks were executed. During the first year, the scope of the Red Terror expanded significantly.

On the one hand, violence isn’t always the best way to solve problems. On the other hand, Lenin said:  


>We must not depict socialism as if socialists will bring it to us on a plate all nicely dressed. That will never happen. Not a single problem of the class struggle has ever been solved in history except by violence. When violence is exercised by the working people, by the mass of exploited against the exploiters — then we are for it!

He shouldn't have been surprised when a socialist shot his ass. Although it’s kind of a dick move to execute her for following his own advice.

traitor,CapitalismVSocialism,"On This Day in Socialist History: The Berlin Sanctions, er, Blockade","[https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/berlin-airlift](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/berlin-airlift)

The **Berlin Blockade** (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949) was one of the first major international crises of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War).

From 17 July to 2 August 1945, the victorious [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) reached the [Potsdam Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam_Agreement) on the fate of postwar Europe. As the seat of the [Allied Control Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_Control_Council), Berlin was divided into four occupation zones, despite the city's location, which was fully located 100 miles (160 km) inside Soviet-controlled eastern Germany. The United States, United Kingdom, and France controlled western portions of the city, while Soviet troops controlled the eastern sector.

After harsh treatment, forced emigration, political repression and the particularly harsh winter of 1945–1946 (Or, as Stalin liked to call it, “just doing business”), Germans in the Soviet-controlled zone were hostile to Soviet endeavors (class traitors!). [Local elections in 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_state_election,_1946) resulted in a massive anti-communist protest vote, especially in the Soviet sector of Berlin. Berlin's citizens overwhelmingly elected non-Communist members to its city government.

Stalin and other leaders told visiting Bulgarian and Yugoslavian delegations in early 1946 that Germany must be both Soviet and communist. Fortunately for Berlin, Stalin was full of shit yet again. The [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) enacted sanctions, and blocked the [Western Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bloc)' railway, road, and canal access to the sectors of [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) under [Western control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world). The Soviets offered to drop the blockade if the Western Allies withdrew the newly introduced [Deutsche Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Mark) from [West Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin). The Western Allies organized the **Berlin Airlift** from 26 June 1948 to 30 September 1949 to carry supplies to the people of West Berlin, a difficult feat given the size of the city and the population.

Having initially concluded there was no way the [airlift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlift) could work, the Soviets found its continued success an increasing surprise and embarrassment. In terms of Stalin being “completely surprised!”, this was surprise #19,982. On 12 May 1949, the USSR lifted the blockade of West Berlin, due to economic issues in East Berlin, although for a time the Americans and British continued to supply the city by air as they were worried that the Soviets would resume the blockade and were only trying to disrupt western supply lines. The Berlin Airlift officially ended on 30 September 1949 after fifteen months.

The Berlin Blockade served to highlight the competing ideological and economic visions for postwar Europe. It played a major role in aligning West Berlin with the United States and Britain as the major protecting powers and in drawing [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany) into the [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) orbit several years later in [1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955). It also demonstrated that socialists can’t even do sanctions right.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/14hvtww/on_this_day_in_socialist_history_the_berlin/,1687620607.0,14hvtww
traitor,CapitalismVSocialism,Truth about how communism worked out in reality,"As a native mandarin speaker, I was recently banished by some socialists on Reddit because I told them China is not what they expected to be. Here I just want to share how those Marxism tenants worked out in reality. 

For those who really love the shit out of China, I must tell you that most Western countries are already way more socialism than China in reality. If you really doubt my words, try search and translate some Chinese news keywords and explain what are the stories behind.

996是你前世修来的福报,低端人口,蛋壳公寓,股价双轨制，嫁给大山的女人

I know Karl Marx had been twisted since Russian Revolution, but something you follow literally will only ends up there. Some examples I listed were Russians and Chinese tried to do it authentically, but screwed due to human greed and weak minds. 

Marx criticized the immorality of capitalism in his entire life, and his criticism was excellent, but he proposed a system more dependent on the kindness and competent of a group even fewer than capitalists.


1.The democratic dictatorship of proletariats

It is just unfortunate there was no brain scan for the person who made up this concept during that time. It had been proven by history that proles who seized political power are not longer proles. As for the rest of them, kind like Geroge Orwell's party members saying ""proles are no human beings"". Believe dictatorship of proletariats is as stupid as believing Donald Trump is a friendly, intelligent, polite, moderate, faithful, colored, mixed blood, transgender, Russian Orthodox socialist like Adolf Maovich Hitler.

2.Abolish classes

As I have said, those who wield the power to abolish classes simply became a new hierarchy and the only person resisted that temptation and kept his tenants is Pol Pot who nearly wiped out his own ethnic in South Asia.

3.Rule of the majority

No matter how you distribute the power, power has to be wielded by the fewer. Although the US presidents are significantly less powerful than dictators, the total number of presidents, senators, governors and mayors is still a tiny fraction of the whole population. If anyone tries to rule a country by majority through literal meaning, then the only solution is anarch. 
It was funny Marxists and Anarchs were always best bodies before the revolution, and worst rivals afterwards, plus the fact Marxism itself also constantly end up being completely repressive or chaos.

4.Centralized economy plan

As I have mentioned, the small fraction of proles who take up the responsibility of democratic dictatorship will always cling on power even they are completely incompetent in anything other than riots and war. Mao had proven himself as a brilliant diplomat and strategist (when he hadn't been driven mad by his ego), but his excellent economy plan The Great Leap caused 30 millions of starvation then he started Cultural Revolution to purge his rival in avoiding to answer for his crime.
There were noble and competent politicians and technocrats at that time, but it was always shameless scums finally prevail in the history of Communism. 

5.More surplus value for the proles

It is easy to calculate the surplus values of Mexican workers who built apartments for Donald Trump, but hard to define how much should belong to Elon Musk and his outsourcing workers. Although I can't guarantee which one is morally better, things do get complicated when this manufacturing involve real technology and management.
In Western countries, people can negotiate through voting and trade unions. These smart socialists like George Orwell were criticized as revisionists and traitors, but they got closer to their aims through peaceful approaches and revealed the true face of those revolutionists. On the other hand, Proles in China and Russia looted rich people's houses and massacred whoever they condemned as enemies, then ended up slaves of the state and cheapest labours for local capitalists again.

One thing I hate about forums on the internet is that there are too many people who don't use their brains but only shout slogans. An alarming proportion of Chinese dissidents on the internet ended up becoming non-white-white-supremacists because of their endorsement to Donald Trump. All I want is to state my points without choosing a side. I would personally fuck the shit out of whoever conspires violent revolution in Western countries if laws permit so, but support homo marriage, better public education and health care. I think it is necessary to arrest the cops who kneed Floyd to death, and Floyd is indeed a criminal. George Floyd had been arrested for multiple times for different crimes and was supposed to be arrested for using fake money and refused to enter the car, so those cops exercised some unnecessary and illegal punishments turn out to be disastrous. Kneeling him for that long is unnecessary but only a display of power. Unlike some far right idiots probably haven't wrestled with people only spent their time on internet, I know people pose no danger after they have been tortured only half of that video's length.
I just made my point on this more specific.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/kalesi/truth_about_how_communism_worked_out_in_reality/,1607626372.0,kalesi

The legacy of Stalin

1) THE RISE OF STALIN, DEBUNKING TROTSKY

Many are the slanders against Stalin, and even more are the myths surrounding him, and the USSR, epsecially during his tenure as the General secretary of the CPSU. Many lies also surround his ""rise to power"", and his faction's conflict with trotskye's. Even today, many leftists still believe that Stalin was somehow an ussurper, and that trotsky was the ""rightfull"" (whatever that means) successor of Lenin.

i)Stalin during the civil war and the first years of the soviet government

It is many times painted, that stalin played a minimal role in the civil war and in the first years of the soviet union, or even a negative role.(leave aside that he was one of the first bolsheviks, contrary to trotsky who only entered the bolsheviks in 1917, stalin was a close ally of lenin since 1905, writing the book Marxism and the national question, and also doing real revolutionary work by attacking banks for the sake of the revolution.

If stalin was not so famous during the revolution in the masses, was because he was in the gulag for about a decade right before he was freed in a little before the revolution) But let's examine the facts. It is impossible that stalin did not enjoyed support from the party since the very beginning. He was one of the ministers since the first days of the October revolution; he was the editor of Pravda before the revolution even occurred. Therefore it is illogical to even claim that stalin was ""mediocre"" as Trotsky wrote.

During the first days after the revolution, even bourgeoisie historians such as Montefiore, describe that Lenin, Stalin, Sverdlov and trotsky were the four most powerful bolsheviks. How could stalin be ""relatively irrelevant"" while he was a high member of the bolsheviks (and this means he enjoyed support) since the very beginnings after the revolution?

During the civil war, stalin was sent to many important posts, where he unmasked many traitors who were working for the white army (some of them were also on good terms with trotsky)

Bourgeoisie historian Robert H. McNeal wrote:

> Stalin had emerged ... as a political military chief whose contribution to the Red victory was second only to Trotsky's. Stalin had played a smaller role than his rival in the overall organizationof the Red Army, but he had been more important in providing direction on crucial fronts. If his reputation as a hero was far below Trotsky's, this had less to do with objective merit than with Stalin's lack of flair ... for self-advertisement.[1]

During the preparations for the Polish soviet war, stalin argued against the war as unrealistic. After the defeat of the Soviets in the war, (to which stalin was a general in the front) most bolsheviks agreed with stalin that indeed the war was a mistake. Unfortunately, it was too late. Due to his actions during the war (plus his previous involvement before the revolution), stalin had achieved high prestige. He held two commissariats, one of the nationalities and one of the workers and peasants inspections. When another high bolshevik, Yevgeni Preobrazhensky(who was later a trotskyist and a member left opposition), complained against stalin holding these positions, Lenin himself replied:

> What can we do to preserve the present situation in the People’s Commissariat of Nationalities; to handle all the Turkestan, Caucasian, and other questions? These are all political questions! They have to be settled. These are questions that have engaged the attention of European states for hundreds of years, and only an infinitesimal number of them have been settled in democratic republics. We are settling them; and we need a man to whom the representatives of any of these nations can go and discuss their difficulties in all detail. Where can we find such a man? I don’t think Comrade Preobrazhensky could suggest any better candidate than Comrade Stalin. The same thing applies to the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. This is a vast business; but to be able to handle investigations we must have at the head of it a man who enjoys high prestige, otherwise we shall become submerged in and overwhelmed by petty intrigue.[2]

All this implies that even Lenin considered Stalin obviously a first rate Bolshevik. If trotskyists or any other person wants to present Stalin as a mediocre and a second rate bolshevik, then it can be said that Lenin himself, was also a mediocrity and a second rate bolshevik for having such a good opinion of stalin and entrusting him with such crucial tasks. 

ii)Lenin's testament

Lenin indeed wrote a letter, but it was not a will, and it could not be, because the party was not Lenin's plaything, nor Lenin was the king of it. So, this exposes the mentality and the very un marxist thinking of the people who tried to refute stalin on the grounds of this ""testament"". Before anything, it must be asserted that Stalin was the second more powerful, if not the most, at around 1922-23 Now the question around on the word ""power"". Power comes from somewhere, in this case, stalin was chosen to by these people, (he was appointed) who vested this power in his shoulders to represent them. In 1923, he was the only person who as a member of both the politburo, the orgburo, the Central committee, and the secretariat. He was also the man responsible for Lenin's relations with the doctors.

The doctors had ordered that Lenin must not be bothered by political matters, as this would make him lose the peace needed to recover. Stalin sough to obey this order, for Lenin's sake. But Lenin's wife, passed information to Lenin bypassing the orders of the doctors. Stalin angry at this, verbally attacked lenin's wife on the phone. When lenin heard this, he became very angry at stalin. Therefore the contents of the letter, need to take in light this personal anger of lenin at the time. When the writings became famous to the west, and many anti communists attacked stalin in 1925, and that the bolsheviks were hiding this ""will"". Trotsky responded at the time.

> Eastman asserts in several places that the Central Committee has “concealed” from the party a large number of documents of extraordinary importance, written by Lenin during the last period of his life. (The documents in question are letters on the national question, the famous “Testament,” etc.) This is pure slander against the Central Committee of our party. Eastman’s words convey the impression that Lenin wrote these letters, which are of an advisory character and deal with the inner-party organization, with the intention of having them published. This is not at all in accordance with the facts.[3]

> If all of these letters have not been published, it is because their author did not intend them to be published. Comrade Lenin has not left any “Testament”; the character of his relations to the party, and the character of the party itself, preclude the possibility of such a “Testament.” The bourgeois and Menshevik press generally understand under the designation of “Testament” one of Comrade Lenin’s letters (which is so much altered as to be almost unrecognizable) in which he gives the party some organizational advice. The Thirteenth Party Congress devoted the greatest attention to this and to the other letters, and drew the appropriate conclusions. All talk with regard to a concealed or mutilated “Testament” is nothing but a despicable lie, directed against the real will of Comrade Lenin and against the interests of the party created by him. [3]

> Eastman’s assertions that the Central Committee confiscated my pamphlets and articles in 1923 or 1924, or at any other time or by any other means has prevented their publication, are untrue, and are based on fantastic rumors. Eastman is again wrong in asserting that Comrade Lenin offered me the post of chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars, and of the Council of Labor and Defense. I hear of this for the first time from Eastman’s book.[3]

The funny part is, that this is true! Lenin was neither a despot, nor the party his personal guard to follow ""wills"". Now if trotsky and his supporters ignore this, in favor of an explanation such as ""trotsky was forced to write this by stalin"", and if we take that what trotsky wrote is not true, and that trotsky wrote it under pressure, then this gives us a very strong info about these people. They thought lenin as a king? The party as his plaything?

Whoever agrees with the narrative pushed about the ""will"", he is fundamentally against the principles Lenin himself supported, which is democractic centralism. Therefore if someone is trying to paint what trotsky himself wrote, he attacks both Lenin, the viability of democratic centralism and the historical facts of stalin growing to become the leader of the party, little by little, by his own contribution as a bolshevik, as a pupil of lenin, and this was manifested to the appointments of him by the whole party in positions of power. Now, one needs to consider what the contexts around the letter is.

The context is Lenin as a sick, paralyzed man who was angry at stalin for speaking badly against his wife on the phone, and who lenin himself never spoke on the letter about any successor. He pointed that stalin was a perfect General secretary, and he would be replaced by someone who was less ""rude"". If we are to speak about rudeness being the issue(with rudeness even being mentioned, showing that Lenin was not in the best of conditions) for sure Lenin did not mean trotsky, who he was famous for being just that. After Lenin died, Stalin asked the CC to release him from the position of the General secretary. What happened was that all voted against it, including Trotsky.

This has a lot to show about trotsky and stalin. On stalin's own words on the issue

> It is said in that ""will'' Comrade Lenin suggested to the congress that in view of Stalin's ""rudeness'' it should consider the question of putting another comrade in Stalin's place as General Secretary. That is quite true. Yes, comrades, I am rude to those who grossly and perfidiously wreck and split the Party. I have never concealed this and do not conceal it now .... At the very first meeting of the plenum of the Central Committee after the Thirteenth Congress I asked the plenum of the Central Committee to release me from my duties as General Secretary. The congress discussed this question. It was discussed by each delegation separately, and all the delegations unanimously, including Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev, obliged Stalin to remain at his post .... A year later I again put in a request to the plenum to release me, but I was obliged to remain at my post.[4]

Stalin was already far more liked, trusted, and capable than any other in the party. It was obvious that in the case of Lenin would die, Stalin would become the leader. Trotsky tries to paint this as a conspiracy of stalin (conspiracy with whom? Did stalin stay in power for 30 years with the help of the Holy spirit? We will never know, according to bourgeoisie historians..One of the seven mysteries of the world) to ""assassinate"" Lenin, and to move to the leadership position. What trotsky and others miss, is that Stalin was already the leader in practice. He was the most capable of the post, he had all the requirements, he was already trusted in posts no one was trusted.

iii)Factionalism, and removal of Trotsky and other dividers from the party

But lets take things from the start. Trotskists and the like, accuse Stalin of banning people from the party (trotsky included) without legitimacy. The people claiming so, ignore that Lenin was the one that passed the resolution of ban of factions and removing people from the party that were supporting and seeding factionalism.

> All class-conscious workers must clearly realise that factionalism of any kind is harmful and impermissible, for no matter how members of individual groups may desire to safeguard Party unity, factionalism in practice inevitably leads to the weakening of team-work and to intensified and repeated attempts by the enemies of the governing Party, who have wormed their way into it, to widen the cleavage and to use it for counter-revolutionary purposes.[5]

> In order to ensure strict discipline within the Party and in all Soviet work and to secure the maximum unanimity in eliminating all factionalism, the Congress authorises the Central Committee, in cases of breach of discipline or of a revival or toleration of factionalism, to apply all Party penalties, including expulsion, and in regard to members of the Central Committee, reduction to the status of alternate members and, as an extreme measure, expulsion from the Party. [5]

There are of course, people who claim that Lenin intended the ban of factions to be temporary; But there are no any evidence to suggest this. Clearly, it can be shown that Lenin meant for the ban of factions to be in place as long as enemies were there. And through the USSR's history, especially the period of 1917-1950(which also covers this topic), where it was perhaps the most ""threatening"" (at least in appearance) time for USSR, with famines, attempted counterevolutions, and invasion, it is ludicrus to claim that the removal of Trotsky and other party members on the basis of factionalism and fragmentation of the party was not legitimate. It was basically in line with Lenin himself. Therefore, any attack against Stalin in this topic, is also an endorsement of attacks made by the mensheviks, syndicalists, and the like against Lenin on the very same issue.

The supposed ""Leninists"" such as trotsky ignore this because it suits them.

2) THE HOLODOMOR

The holodomor was a man made famine, we are always told. But in reality it much more complex than that.

The thing that triggered the famine was not that Stalin took the grain from the Ukrainian land owners, in fact it was the opposite.

Stalin tried to initiate collectivization but the rich landowners, kulaks, deliberately burned their stockpiled grain and killed their animals so the Soviets wouldn't take them.

When the crops failed, the kulaks didn't have any food left since they burned the food that was supposed to keep them going.

The famine has been used by western historians, especially before 1991 (so people who didn't have access to the Soviet archives) to claim that Stalin magically killed millions of people. One finds estimates anywhere between 2 million to a staggering 10 or 20 million deaths.

Conclusion

The Holodomor is nazi propaganda and not an actual genocide.

4)THE 1936 CONSTITUTION

Few people of the left know about the 1936 Soviet constitution. It was called the ""Stalin"" constitution by the west. In this constitution, one does not need to look too much. This is the most proggresive constitution of its time, and even today it eclipses the today's western ""democracies"". We will examine some of the most crucial parts that may interest the reader, namely the economy and the elections. First, the part about economy. In the constitution, it is stated that there are only two types of property. The socialist property, (i.e, the state property, which is simply the proletariat class organized) and the cooperative property. The capitalist mode of production of NEP was disappeared. We are left only with these two modes, to which, no exploitation of man by man is made. The USSR was the only country to achieve this first.

> ARTICLE 4. The socialist system of economy and the socialist ownership of the means and instruments of production, firmly established as a result of the abolition of the capitalist system of economy, the abrogation of private ownership of the means and instruments of production and the abolition of the exploitation of man by man, constitute the economic foundation of the U.S.S.R.

> ARTICLE 5. Socialist property in the U.S.S.R. exists either in the form of state property (the possession of the whole people), or in the form of cooperative and collective-farm property (property of a collective farm or property of a cooperative association).

In addition to these, there exists also petty bourgeoisie property, where self employed people own their means of production, but they cannot employ other people.

> ARTICLE 9. Alongside the socialist system of economy, which is the predominant form of economy in the U.S.S.R., the law permits the small private economy of individual peasants and handicraftsmen based on their personal labour and precluding the exploitation of the labour of others.

Also, it is cleared that USSR is a socialist country, yet to reach communism where the principle of ""to each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" does not apply.

> ARTICLE 12. In the U.S.S.R. work is a duty and a matter of honour for every able-bodied citizen, in accordance with the principle: ""He who does not work, neither shall he eat."" The principle applied in the U.S.S.R. is that of socialism : ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his work.""

Second Part, Electoral system It is highlighted, that all organs of government are elected by the people, in a secret ballot each election.

> ARTICLE 134. Members of all Soviets of Working People's Deputies - of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics, the Soviets of Working People's Deputies of the Territories and Regions, the Supreme Soviets of the Autonomous Republics, the Soviets of Working People’s Deputies of Autonomous Regions, area, district, city and rural (stanitsa, village, hamlet, kishlak, aul) Soviets of Working People's Deputies - are chosen by the electors on the basis of universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot.

In all, the soviet constitution of 1936, was, and still is a role model to the socialists of the world. The sheer attacks made against it to disprove it or slander it, is a proof of the fear the bourgeoisie have on this constitution. Their fear that this constitution will one day become the constitution of their own countries

5) THE GREAT PURGE

Some people claim that the great purge was completely unnecessary, but in fact it was the opposite. Without it the USSR would be weak with traitors and opportunists in its ranks. Here are some of the most notable counter revolutionaries in the USSR.

First four traitors, Zinoviev, Trotsky his son Sedon and Kamenev. They formed an illegal underground bloc to try to sabotage the USSR. Trotsky was exiled to Mexico but the others remained and tried to sabotage the USSR from within.

After the trials of his Comrades, Trotsky famously denied the existence of the underground bloc, claiming instead that it was a fabrication of Stalin. But evidence, including the following letter, suggests otherwise.

Letter from Sedov to Trotsky

> The (…)[1] is organised it includes the Zinovievists, the Sten–Lominadze Group and the Trotskyists (former ”…”)[2]. The Safar–Tarkhan Group have not yet formally entered they have too extreme a position; they will enter very soon. The declaration of Z. and K.[3]on the very grave mistake which they made in 1927* was made at the time of the negotiations with our people about the bloc, just before Z. and K. were deported.

> The collapse of the I.N. (…) [4] Group, Preobrazh.[5] and Uf. 6 was provoked by a sick, partly insane man. They arrested him by chance and he began to talk. They have certainly found no document in the homes of I.N. or the others that could be “Trotskyist literature”. Some days before I.N. was arrested, he told our informant: “X. has betrayed and I am expecting to be arrested from one day to the next.

1 The missing word has been cut out with scissors. It seems to be the word “bloc”

2 The missing word has been carefully erased. It seems to be “capitulators”.

3 Z and K are obviously Zinoviev and Kamenev. *Capitulated to the Party majority instead of siding with Trotsky

4 The missing word has been carefully erased. It seems to be “Smirnov”

5 Preobrazhensky

6 Ufimtsev

An other traitor, Yagoda, the head of the OGPU and the killer of Kirov, the best friend of Stalin and a very influential politician.

> In 1934, before the murder of Kirov, the terrorist Leonid Nikolayev was picked up by OGPU agents in Leningrad. In his possession they found a gun. and a chart showing the route which Kirov traveled daily. When Yagoda was notified of Nikolayev's arrest, he instructed Zaporozhetz, assistant chief of the Leningrad OGPU, to release the terrorist without further examination. Zaporozhetz was one of Yagoda's men. He did what he was told.A few weeks later, Nikolayev murdered Kirov.

What did he hope to accomplish ?

> Yagoda had his own ideas about the kind of government whichwould be set up after Stalin was overthrown. It would be modeled on that of Nazi Germany, he told Bulanov. Yagoda himself would be the Leader; Rykov would replace Stalin as secretary of a reorganized Party; Tomsky would be chief of the trade-unions, which would come under strict military control like the Nazi labor battalions; the ""philosopher"" Bukharin, as Yagoda put it, would be ""Dr. Goebbels.""

Now let's talk about Bukharin, Rykov, Tomsky and Tukhachevsky. They were planning to coup Stalin when the war with Nazi Germany started.

Also they promised Hitler everything Germany had in 1917 if they recognized their coup

> How does Tukhachevsky visualize the mechanism of the coup?""

> ""That's the business of the military organization,"" Tomsky replied. He added that the moment the Nazis attacked Soviet Russia, the Military Group planned to ""open the front to the Germans"" - that is, to surrender to the German High Command. This plan had been worked out in detail and agreed upon by Tukhachevsky, Putna, Gamarnik and the Germans.

> ""In that case,"" said Bukharin thoughtfully, ""we might be able to get rid of the Bonapartist danger that alarms me.""

> Tomsky did not understand. Bukharin went on to explain: Tukhachevsky would try to set up a military dictatorship; he might even try to get popular support by making scapegoats of the political leaders of the conspiracy. But, once in power, the politicians could turn the tables on the Military Group. Bukharin told Tomsky: ""It might be necessary to try those guilty of the `defeat' at the front. This will enable us to win over the masses by playing on patriotic slogans...""

Here is also a pro Germany quote from Tukhachevsky

> ""You are wrong to tie the fate of your country to countries which are old and finished, such as France and Britain. We ought to turn towards new (nazi) Germany... Germany will assume the leading position on the continent of Europe""

Now finally let's talk about Yeznov.

He tried to sabotage the USSR by falsely accusing innocent party members of betraying the revolution and then kicking them out of the party.

From his trial

> ""All of this was done in order to cause in order to cause widespread dissatisfaction in the population with the leadership of the party and the Soviet government and in that way to create the most favorable base for carrying out our conspiratorial plans.""

He and his fellow conspirators kicked more than 200 thousand people, about 60% of which were innocent and reinstated when everything was discovered by Stalin.

A quote from one of them

> We endeavored to expel as many people as possible from the party as possible. We expelled people when there were no grounds for expulsion. We had one aim in view - to increase the number the number of embittered people and thus increase the number of our allies""

Speaking about Stalin, he was always opposed to the number of people kicked out from the party. He criticized Yeznov a lot on the issue.

Here is a dialogue between them from a Central Committee Plenum (June 1936)

> Yeznov : ""Comrades, as a result of the verification of party documents, we have expelled more than 200 thousand party members""

> Stalin : ""[Interrupting] Very many""

> Yeznov : ""Yes very many. I will speak about this....""

> Stalin : ""[Interrupting again] If we expelled 30 thousand, and 600 former Trotskyists and Zinovievists it would be a bigger victory""

An other quote from Stalin about Yeznov after this had all this had ended .

> ""Yeznov is a rat,in 1938 he killed many innocent people. We shot him for that.""

What you might say is that the trials were somehow staged by Beria and the NKVD but that is simply not true, even the American ambassador to the USSR, Joseph E. Davies, who was present at the trials of these criminals said they were not staged.

> ""With an interpreter at my side, I followed the testimony carefully. Naturally I must confess that I was predisposed to the credibility of the testimony of these defendants... Viewed objectively however and based upon my experience in the trial of cases and the application of the tests of credibility which past experience had afforded me, I arrived at the reluctant conclusion that the state had established it's case, at least to the extent of proving the existence of a widespread conspiracy and plot among the political leaders against the Soviet government,""

Conclusion

Without a purge the USSR would have been weak and unable to fight the fascists. Stalin wasn't a lunatic or a power hungry politician that purged his opponents, he protected the USSR from revisionists and traitors.

6)WW2 myths and misconceptions

“Stalin was a bad military general and a coward”

Stalin never left his cabinet at the start of the war as many people would like you to believe by saying he was “shocked, paralised and did nothing”. Stalin stayed put, this is seen by the people he had meetings with at the start of the war. On the 22nd of June he had meetings 29 times starting from 5:45 am.

This is what Vasilevsky had to say about Stalin in his memoirs - “In my deep conviction, Stalin, with the second half of World War II, is the most powerful and colorful figure in the strategic command. He successfully carried out the organisation of fronts, all the military efforts of the country”. During the battle of Moscow, Stalin stated that he would stay in the city when the Wehrmacht was closing in. He had a parade organised for the 24th anniversary of the October Revolution after which troops left off to the frontline which were the outskirts of Moscow. Furthermore, most vital plans had Stalin coordinating them such as the operations to crush the German 6th army at Stalingrad and the German pincer at Kursk. Stalin's name was even assigned to 10 blows to the Germans as “Stalin's ten blows”. Thus, we can conclude that Stalin never turned his back on the Soviet people and did not break as Capitalist leaders did.

“The Soviets won only because of Order 227” - Order 227 was issued by Stalin only after the Red Army kept retreating deeper and deeper into the East of the country. As Stalin states, the Red Army left behind “70 million” Soviets for the Germans to torment, rape and pillage. It was only a countermeasure and was issued towards the commanders and soldiers of the Red Army. Furthermore, the Germans also punished those who deserted their position without an order from the high command of the Wehrmacht. Could we also assume that the Germans conquered all their territory out of fear? Moving on, there were only 200 men behind the frontlines, they would not be able to stop entire divisions even if they wanted to. In reality, most troops were told to return to the frontline or arrested and sent to a military tribunal, only in rare cases were they shot, while many Wetsern movies such as Enemy at the gates depict mass friendly fire instances which were never recorded. Lastly, order 227 was abolished by Stalin on the 29th of October 1944, which shows us that the Soviets did not win the only because of 227. The Red army lost more troops compared to the Axis powers

“The Soviets only won because of numbers, they charged machine gun nests”(cough cough, you mean Omaha beach?). In reality, the Red Army lost around 10 million troops, while the Axis troops combined lost 9.5 million troops(dead + captured). However, 3.5 of the 10 million Soviets died in captivity. While only 500,000 Axis died in captivity. Furthermore, if you look at the frontline in 1941, the Axis troops outnumber the Soviets 2:1, does that also mean the Germans were winning initially just because of their supporierty in numbers? If not, why does the same not apply to the Red Army?

The Soviet winter defeated the Nazi’s - It may be true that the Soviet winter was cold, however one cannot state that the Soviets were not affected by the cold as much as the Germans. Furthermore, it was the Soviets that were always in the offensive during the winter. Primary examples could be seen during the winter of 1941 and 1942, where the Soviets first launched a counter offensive around Moscow and then launched Operation Uranus around Stalingrad, beating back the Nazi’s in both cases. Some may suggest that the winter actually benefited the Wehrmacht as roads would solidify for the Mechanized units to push further along after the long muddy season. Thus, we can conclude that the winter was not the main reason for Nazi defeat, as saying so removes credit from the heroic actions of Soviet men and women.

7) THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF STALIN

Stalin’s greatest achievements:

Economy Created a superpower from a backward agricultural country in just 20 years, we have a saying - “Stalin accepted Russia with a plow, and left with an atomic bomb”. 20 years is a very small amount of time and yet Stalin and the Soviet people which were powered by the Socilalist economy were able to do this for the first time in history. This is humanity's greatest achievement.

From 1926 - 1953 the Soviet Population increased by around 60 million people, ie 146,6 million up to 208,8 even though they went through 3 wars. From 1926 - 1953 the Average humans age increased from 44 to 63, while the death rate fell from 29.1(1913) to 10.1(1950) per 1000 people which shows the great emphasis on medical care the USSR had.

Full industrialization of the country, around 6000 small to large scale factories were built under Stalin’s five year plans. This means that there were 1.5 factories being built per day, most of these factories still run up to this day. In 1920, the National Per capita Income was 120 dollars by 1980’s standards, while in 1950 it was already 1100 dollars by 1980’s dollar value. In 1920 the share of world industrial products was 0.6%, while by 1950 it was 7%. The USSR had eliminated homelessness and joblessness for the first time in history of mankind. The number of scientists in 1950 increased 1.5 times compared to 1940 even though the Soviets went though the bloodiest war the human race has ever seen.

The number of scientific institutions in 1950 increased by 40% compared with 1940. The number of university students in 1950 increased by 50% compared with 1940. There were over 4,000 newly created sovkhozes in the country by 1940 alone, this number kept rising in the 50’s. 531 thousand tractors, 182 thousand grain combines and 228 thousand trucks were built and worked in the fields by 1940. Gross agricultural production in 1940 increased by 1.14 times compared with 1913, including grain - 1.1 times, raw cotton - 4 times, sugar beet - 1.7 times, sunflower - 2.4 times, potatoes - 1.6 times, vegetables - 2 times.(Keep in mind that the Russian empire was a highly agricultural society already). 70,000 Soviet cities, towns and villages were destroyed by the Axis. Destroyed in that process were 6 million houses, 98,000 farms, 32,000 factories, 82,000 schools, 43,000 libraries, 6,000 hospitals and thousands of kilometers of roads and railway tracks, most if not all of which were rebuilt after the war by Stalin without the help of the Marshall plan, which Capitalist Western Europe could not do. (The British empire crumbled with the help of the US and the war did not affect them as much either).He was in charge of one of the first Socialist Nations in the world. Gave equal rights to all ethic groups and races. Gave equal rights to both genders. Eliminated homelessness and joblessness.

Gave the Soviet people, free housing, free medicine, free education. Foreign Achievements Was the first to condemn Nazi Germany and tried to make an alliance with France and Britain to combat them. Offered to send troops to Czechoslovakia when the Western Capitalists sold them out to the Nazi’s.

Beat back the combined forces of Capitalist Europe with Nazi Germany at the forefront in a long 4 year war saving the peoples of Eastern Europe and the world, while showing the might of a planned socialist economy. Spread Socialism to Eastern Europe and held the imperialists at bay by not accepting the dollar, thus saving the people of East of exploitation and dependency towards a more powerful capitalist state. Helped the Chinese Communists defeat the imperialist supported Chinese Nationalists. Helped the Koreans fight off American imperialism and beat them back to the 38th parallel.

9) The Legacy of Stalin

As we have clearly have shown you, Stalin was a great leader for his time, he was also one of the most important Marxists ever. He turned a feudal country to a world superpower in just 20 years and he continued Lenin's legacy that destroyed the Nazi invaders both in the East and the West. Many people, mostly bourgeois historians or revisionists lie about him for personal gain. Do not fall for their propaganda comrades!

traitor,CapitalismVSocialism,The Capitalist Undermining of American Democracy and Its Socialist Institutions,"The ruling elites are painfully aware that the foundations of American power are rotting. The outsourcing of manufacturing in the United States and the plunging of over half the population into poverty will, they know, not be reversed. The self-destructive government shutdown has been only one of numerous assaults on the efficiency of the administrative state. The failing roads, bridges and public transportation are making commerce and communications more difficult. The soaring government deficit, now almost a trillion dollars thanks to the Trump administration’s massive corporate tax cuts, cannot be eliminated. The seizure of the financial system by global speculators ensures, sooner rather than later, another financial meltdown. The dysfunction of democratic institutions, which vomit up con artists such as Donald Trump and hold as alternatives inept, corporate-indentured politicians such as Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi, is cementing into place a new authoritarianism. The hollowing out of the pillars of the state, including the diplomatic corps and regulatory agencies, leaves the blunt force of the military as the only response to foreign disputes and fuels endless and futile foreign wars.

Just as ominous as the visible rot is the internal decay. Among all social classes there is a loss of faith in the government, widespread frustration, a sense of stagnation and entrapment, bitterness over unfulfilled expectations and promises, and a merging of fact and fiction so that civil and political discourse is no longer rooted in reality. The nation’s isolation by its traditional allies and its inability, especially in the face of environmental catastrophe, to articulate rational and visionary policies have shattered the mystique that is vital to power. “A society becomes totalitarian when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial,” George Orwell wrote. “That is when its ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud.” Our elites have exhausted fraud. Force is all they have left.

The United States is a wounded beast, bellowing and thrashing in its death throes. It can inflict tremendous damage, but it cannot recover. These are the last, agonizing days of the American Empire. The death blow will come when the dollar is dropped as the world’s reserve currency, a process already underway. The value of the dollar will plummet, setting off a severe depression and demanding instant contraction of the military overseas.

Seth A. Klarman, who runs the Baupost Group hedge fund, which manages about $27 billion, just sent a sobering 22-page letter to his investors. He pointed out that the nation’s ratio of government debt to gross domestic product from 2008 to 2017 exceeded 100 percent and is close to that in France, Canada, Britain and Spain. The debt crisis, he warned, could be the “seeds” of the next financial crisis. He decried the global unraveling of “social cohesion,” adding, “It can’t be business as usual amid constant protests, riots, shutdowns and escalating social tensions.”


“There is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford,” he said in the letter. “By the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order.”

The ruling elites, worried about impending financial collapse, are scrambling to cement into place harsh legal and physical forms of control to stymie what they fear could be widespread popular unrest, nascent forms of which can be seen in the strikes carried out by American teachers and the protests by the “yellow vests” in France.

The ruling ideology of neoliberalism, the ruling elites recognize, has been discredited across the political spectrum. This is forcing the elites to make unsavory alliances with neofascists, who in the United States are represented by the Christian right. This Christianized fascism is swiftly filling Trump’s ideological void. It is embodied in figures such as Mike Pence, Mike Pompeo, Brett Kavanaugh and Betsy DeVoss.

In its most virulent form, one that will be expressed once the economy goes into crisis, this Christian fascism will seek to purge the society of those branded as social deviants, including immigrants, Muslims, “secular humanist” artists and intellectuals, feminists, gays and lesbians, Native Americans and criminals—largely poor people of color—based on a perverted and heretical interpretation of the Bible. Abortion will be illegal. The death penalty will be mandated for a variety of crimes. Education will be dominated by white supremacist views of history, indoctrination and the teaching of creationism or “intelligent design.” The pantheon of new America heroes will include Robert E. Lee, Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon. The state will portray the white majority as victims.

This Christian fascism, like all forms of totalitarianism, wraps itself in a cloying piety, promising moral as well as physical renewal. The degradation of mass culture with its celebration of sexual sadism, graphic violence and personal dysfunction, its plagues of opioid addiction, suicide, gambling and alcoholism, along with social chaos and government dysfunction, will lend credibility to the Christian fascists’ promise of a return to a “Christian” purity. The cloak of this piety will be used to snuff out all civil liberties.

Central to any totalitarian ideology is a constant inquisition against supposedly clandestine and sinister groups held responsible for the country’s demise. Conspiracy theories, which already color Trump’s worldview, will proliferate. The ruling rhetoric will whipsaw the population, swinging from championing individualism and personal freedom to calling for abject subservience to those who claim to speak for the nation and God, from the sanctity of life to advocating the death penalty, unrestrained police violence and militarism, from love and compassion to the fear of being branded a heretic or traitor. A grotesque hypermasculinity will be celebrated. Violence will be held up as the mechanism to cleanse the society and the world of evil. Facts will be erased or altered. Lies will become true. Political language will be cognitive dissonance. The more the country declines, the more the paranoia and collective insanity will grow. All of these elements are present in varying forms within the culture and our failed democracy. They will become pronounced as the country unravels and the disease of totalitarianism spreads.

The ruling oligarchs, as in all failed states, will retreat into fortified compounds, many of which they are already preparing, where they will have access to basic services, health care, education, water, electricity and security largely denied to the wider population. The central government will be reduced to its most basic functions—internal and external security and collecting taxes. Severe poverty will cripple the lives of most citizens. Any essential service once provided by the state, from utilities to basic policing, will be privatized, expensive and inaccessible to those without resources. Trash will pile up in the streets. Crime will explode. The electrical grid and water systems—decrepit, poorly maintained and run by corporations—will repeatedly turn on and off.

The mass media will become nakedly Orwellian, chatting endlessly about a bright future and pretending America remains a great superpower. It will substitute political gossip for news—a corruption already far advanced—while insisting that the country is in an economic recovery or about to enter one. It will refuse to address ever-worsening social inequality, political and environmental deterioration and military debacles. Its primary role will be to peddle illusions so that an atomized public, fixated on its electronic screens, will be diverted from the collapse and see its plight as personal rather than collective. Dissent will become more difficult as critics are censored and attacked as responsible for the decline. Hate groups and hate crimes will proliferate and be tacitly empowered and condoned by the state. Mass shootings will be commonplace. The weak—especially children, women, the disabled, the sick and the elderly—will be exploited, abandoned or abused. The strong will be omnipotent.

There will still be money to be made. Corporations will sell anything for a profit—security, dwindling food supplies, fossil fuel, water, electricity, education, medical care, transportation—forcing citizens into debt peonage that will see their meager assets seized when they can’t make payments. The prison population, already the largest in the world, will expand along with the number of citizens forced to wear electronic monitors 24 hours a day. Big corporations will pay no income tax or at best a symbolic tax. They will be above the law, able to abuse and underpay workers and poison the environment without oversight or regulation.

As income inequality becomes more massive, financial titans such as Jeff Bezos, worth some $140 billion, will increasingly function as modern-day slaveholders. They will preside over financial empires where impoverished employees will live in run-down campers and trailer parks while toiling 12 hours a day in vast, poorly ventilated warehouses. These employees, paid subsistence wages, will be constantly recorded, tracked and monitored by digital devices. They will be fired when the punishing work conditions cripple their health. For many Amazon employees the future is now.

Work will be a form of serfdom for all but the upper elites and managers. Jeffrey Pfeffer in his book “Dying for a Paycheck: How Modern Management Harms Employee Health and Company Performance—and What We Can Do About It” quotes a survey in which 61 percent of employees said workplace stress had made them ill and 7 percent said they required hospitalization as a result. The stress of overwork, he writes, may cause 120,000 deaths annually in the United States. In China there are an estimated 1 million deaths a year from overwork.

This is the world the elites are preparing for by setting in place legal mechanisms and internal security forces to strip us of liberty.

We, too, must begin to prepare for this dystopia, not only to ensure our survival but to build mechanisms to blunt and attempt to overthrow the totalitarian power the elites expect to wield. Alexander Herzen, speaking to a group of anarchists a century ago about how to overthrow the Russian czar, reminded his listeners that it was their job not to save a dying system but to replace it: “We think we are the doctors. We are the disease.” All efforts to reform the American system is capitulation. No progressive in the Democratic Party is going to rise up, take control of the party and save us. There is one ruling party. The corporate party. It may engage in petty, internecine warfare, as it did in the recent government shutdown. It may squabble over power and the spoils of power. It may come wrapped in more tolerant stances regarding women, LGBT rights and the dignity of people of color, but on the fundamental issues of war, internal security and corporate domination there is no divergence.

We must carry out organized civil disobedience and forms of non-cooperation to weaken corporate power. We must use, as in France, widespread and sustained social unrest to push back against the designs of our corporate masters. We must sever ourselves from reliance on corporations in order to build independent, sustainable communities and alternative forms of power. The less we need corporations the freer we will become. This will be true in every aspect of our lives, including food production, education, journalism, artistic expression and work. Life will have to be communal. No one, unless he or she is part of the ruling elite, will have the resources to survive alone.

The longer we pretend this dystopian world is not imminent, the more unprepared and disempowered we will be. The ruling elite’s goal is to keep us entertained, frightened and passive while they build draconian structures of oppression grounded in this dark reality. It is up to us to pit power against power. Ours against theirs. Even if we cannot alter the larger culture, we can at least create self-sustaining enclaves where we can approximate freedom. We can keep alive the burning embers of a world based on mutual aid rather than mutual exploitation. And this, given what lies in front of us, will be a victory.

traitor,CapitalismVSocialism,Socialists are responsible for starvation and utter economic failure in Venezuela,"Regardless of what policies they are imposing there's two undeniable facts:

1. Chavez/Maduro are self-described and earnest socialists whom desire to somehow create a society of equality and worker-ownership of the means of production. 

2. If not for these two men coming into power, Venezuela would not have massive food lines and general economic shortages. Whatever it is these two men did to try to get to a socialist society, it is they, two socialists, who have created this situation.

This is a milk-line in Caracas, Venezuela, when the government announced that one store in the capital city of some 3 million people would begin selling milk:

https://i.imgur.com/NN9Gv3q.jpg

This is a line to buy food in Venezuela:

https://i.imgur.com/pgkIagq.jpg

Neither of these photos would have happened if capitalism had not been interfered with by the socialists in power in Venezuela. This is undeniable. Shortages like this do not tend to happen in capitalist societies, because the second it looks like a shortage might develop, someone realizes they can make a profit by moving that product from other areas to where it's needed most.

*It is the profit motive that keeps shortages from happening; profit is a good thing!*

The indignities that Venezuelans have been forced to undergo because two socialists took absolute power in Venezuela extend even to their most private moments. This is a line to buy toilet paper in Venezuela:

https://i.imgur.com/JqLZArm.jpg

This would not have happened if two socialists didn't interfere with the function of capitalism in Venezuela.

Ordinary Venezuelans are both incredibly upset with the government, and have realized they've now been snookered by these socialists.

https://i.imgur.com/zaBaGDc.jpg

Anyone in Venezuela who is able to leave and has a marketable skill has either left or is trying to get out. The young are fleeing Venezuelal in droves; doctors, engineers, lawyers, etc., all escaping Venezuela.

https://i.imgur.com/e3ZFr6W.png

All of this happened ONLY because of socialists gaining power in Venezuela, and would surely NOT have happened if socialists had never gained power in Venezuela.

The why of it happening is less important, but has to do with socialist-bias against all profit-seeking activity in economics, with government use of price-controls to try to attack profit, redistribute income, and buy votes from the poor.

But the result is a destroyed economic system.

And the result has been humanitarian crisis, which the socialist government is standing in the way of getting people help.

[Socialism Has Created a Humanitarian Disaster in Venezuela](http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/socialism-has-created-humanitarian-disaster-venezuela)

> The economic crisis is having a particularly nasty impact on healthcare. According to the Venezuelan Pharmaceutical Federation, only 20 per cent of the drugs that doctors require are available. People must rely on social media to scout the country for medications for their loved ones. The lack of spare parts means that much medical equipment is useless: 86 per cent of X-Ray machines are out of service, for example. **“Babies born prematurely are dying like little chicks”** was a February headline of El Nacional, Venezuela’s last independent daily. It quoted a resident doctor in one of the public hospitals saying that, **due to the shortages, they cannot save the lives of all patients. “We are operating under war conditions,” she said.**

People are dying that *wouldn't be dead*, if socialists were not running Venezuela.

In promising to make healthcare free, the result is healthcare was destroyed. Venezuelans are now literally dying in the streets, trying to get health care from border countries, and the Venezuelan government cares more about food smuggling than protecting these peoples lives: 

[Venezuelans Make Taxing Trek to Seek Health Care in Colombia](http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/venezuelans-make-taxing-trek-seek-health-care-colombia-37521932)

>  Cubides' trips to a dialysis center in Cucuta turned into multi-hour ordeals that left him too tired to eat dinner. He gave up his job as a city gardener. Then, one hot afternoon shortly after New Year's Day, he stumbled and fell on the bridge. He was dead by the time he arrived at a Cucuta hospital, his medical records and death certificate show.

> ""This never would have happened if not for the closure. It was day after day of fatigue for him,"" said his mother, Elvira Cubides, wiping away tears. ""This country has lost its heart.""

You realize that food smuggling *is not even an issue in capitalist societies???*

Venezuela cannot keep the lights on, even in their own capital. How can hospitals operate with no medicine and no electricity? 

Venezuela's economy is on life support and the organs are shutting down, and the most essential services are going with it, including those things the poor need most.

[Socialist Venezuela has blackouts in the capital and stores are cutting hours. The economy is shutting down.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35519167)

Meanwhile all Maduro does, the socialist leader of Venezuela, is [*blame capitalists*](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-04/maduro-calls-owner-of-largest-food-company-thief-and-traitor) for all the economic failure.

If you are unwilling to accept the reality of the situation, you need to do a great deal of introspection. These are peoples' lives we're talking about, and no one should have to go through what *socialists* have put Venezuela through, ever again!

Listen to an actual Venezuelan tell you about his own struggles under socialism. This is happening, this is real, and it is the fault of socialists, because without them and their irrational bias against market activity and profit-seeking, the economy would not be circling the drain right now:

Socialists will never get anywhere unless they start accepting the deficiencies in their theories and integrating actual experience into what works and what doesn't when it comes to implementing socialism. NEVER EVER try to implement top down socialism by taking over a government again, it does not work, it cannot work.

I have far more respect for those of you who say that you will wait for capitalism to automate everything and then socialism will naturally result. I still think you're wrong, but at least that's plausible. Top down socialism is not plausible and has resulted in humanitarian crisis literally everywhere in the world that it has been tried.

Stop fucking up countries and destroying peoples' lives.

patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,Is President Trumps memo an example of oligarchs trying to make criticizing them illegal?,"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/countering-domestic-terrorism-and-organized-political-violence/

""These movements portray **foundational American principles (e.g., support for law enforcement** and border control) as “fascist” to justify and encourage acts of violent revolution.  This “anti-fascist” lie has become the organizing rallying cry used by domestic terrorists to wage a violent assault against democratic institutions, constitutional rights, and fundamental American liberties.  Common threads animating this violent conduct include **anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism**, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.""

The things that stuck out to me in this memo are 

1) portraying support for law enforcement as a ""foundational"" american principle (lol)

2) linking anti-capitalism to terrorism. Now of course I'd like to hear what the president calls the assassinations of socialist leaders around the world by the CIA. 

3) linking anti-americanism to terrorism. Well I suppose this one makes sense at face value. Though given what the patriot act was,it seems to suggest that criticizing the wealthy oligarchs and how they run america is what makes you a some kind of terrorist sympathizer.

patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,"Patriotic Americans, Following Ben Franklin, Accept The Labor Theory Of Value","Ben Franklin was one the founding fathers of the United States. He participated in the constitutional convention. He was the first Postmaster General. He did experiments with electricity, when the Leyden jar was a new thing. There is a story about him flying a kite in a thunderstorm.

He also [wrote](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-16-02-0048) about the wealth of nations:

>""Finally, there seem to be but three ways for a nation to acquire wealth. The first is by war, as the Romans did, in plundering their conquered neighbors. This is robbery. The second by commerce, which is generally cheating. The third by agriculture, the only honest way, wherein man receives a real increase of the seed thrown into the ground, in a kind of continual miracle, wrought by the hand of God in his favour, as a reward for his innocent life and his virtuous industry.""

I find an echo of Francois Quesnay and the physiocrats in the above quotation. He was also a proponent of a labor theory of value:

>""Trade in general being nothing else but the exchange of labor for labor, the value of all things is justly measured by labor.""

I could not find Franklin in the index of Marx's Theories of Surplus Value. A quick google search had me stumbling upon Aiken's 1966 article.

Do you oppose the ideas of the founding fathers?

patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,The treatement of Soviet culture as neccesarily propaganda/bad vs Western culture as progressive/apolitical,"I know this isn't specifically about economics, but it'ts still a pertinent topic and idk where else to post it cuz I feel I'll get a lot of hate either way if I post it in standard Western subreddits about culture and entertainment. They're still very biased, even if they don't admit it.




Hey there.

Before I'll begin, I'll try to explain what exactly I mean, because this is something I’ve struggled with *for years* .

Please excuse me if my text is too long, I really need to get this out of my chest, and I want this to be a comprehensive overview of the problem.


If you're wondering whether it's entirely appropriate for this subreddit, tbh, one big issue is that, often times, I don't even know WHERE to post this outside of this subreddit, because I know that on most subreddits, I can very easily receive a LOOOOOOT of hate. A lot of people in the comments will tell me how I'm wrong it that it's actually deserved because my culture is obviously worse than the American one. Or people directly insulting me and calling me a ""typical Russian"" (whioch isn't even true), I already got this nonsensical response. Which only shows how profound the problem really is, unfortunately. One culture IS treated as much more political than another.



Basically, when I talk about ""culture"", I talk about different components of everyday life, entertainment and art. For example : music, movies, video games, literature, comics, architecture and design.


Overall, whether we like it or not, all these things are derived from some specific cultural traditions and often times originate in a certain place, turning around specific cultural elements, all with a specific history around it.


Basically, growing up, I was exposed to cultural elements belonging to two different cultural traditions, and the thing is, it's only now, when I grew up, that I've realised how differently they're treated and how racist and messed up that really is.


The first one is the one everyone here is probably already familiar with. The one which is so default nowadays that people don't even consider it culture specific anymore. Yes, I'm talking specifically about the English speaking culture, mostly coming from the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as the rest of the Anglosphere.



Watching *Home Alone* at Christmas, reading *Harry Potter* on a lazy afternoon, waiting for the next *Spider-Man* movie, or listening to the *rock band* called *Linkin Park* — all these things definitely belong to Anglophone culture.

The second one is the Soviet era culture of the different Soviet Republics, mostly, though not always, in the Russian language.

For me, and countless others, childhood meant listening to *Milliony Alykh Roz*, watching *Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future* and *Kanikuly Strogogo Rezhima* , spending summers at camps built around the same themes, laughing at *Nu, Pogodi!* , admiring the intricate *mosaics* in the local Palace of Culture, and flipping through *Murzilka* comics at home. Depending on the republic, bands like *Via Iveria* or *Pesnyary* might resonate more for some than others. But at its core, all that is still a part of our shared, common culture, just as much as Anglophone movies and songs are for Westerners.

Dreaming of space travel, idolizing *Yuri Gagarin* , believing in the promise of a ***Bright Future*** —these weren’t just fantasies; they were ideals ingrained in us, just as much a part of our identity as any childhood memory shaped by the Anglophone world.







Unfortunately though, these two cultures are clearly NOT treated in the same way in the slightest, which just exposes the big unfairness of our society.

The thing is, Anglophone and Westerner culture is always ALLOWED to exist and only spread further and further globally, while Soviet style Russophone culture absolutely isn't. It's always treated as something that's political and that HAS to to ""justified"".




Why is Anglophone culture allowed to not only be considered neutral and apolitical but even ""universal""? 
Why do people treat my culture like it’s something toxic that needs to be justified or defended?

This, btw, happens, regardless of the actions of America and the West. Regardless of all the countless crimes commited by the United States and what government they have, their culture isn't ever linked to that. Even if the US will invade Iraq, literally nobody would ever connect all that ""global"" pop culture with this government.


Nobody would watch *Spider-Man* and feel the need to ask, “But what about American slavery? What about the genocide of Native Americans? What about brutal British colonialism? Do you really the tyrannical colonial regime of the United States?”.

You can sing *I Will Always Love You* in the Philippines, and nobody would say ""Why are you singing in English? Why not Navajo, Cherokee or Irish? Are you really supporting forced Anglicization of Indigenous people""?

No one associates Anglophone pop culture with the atrocities of the empires that created it. 


But the moment I express love for anything tied to my own culture, whether the Soviet era genres and aestetics, or all the Russian language movies and songs, I’m immediately judged. People bring up Stalin. They bring up totalitarianism. They say it's ""propaganda"". People accuse me of ""not being patriotic"" for feeling a close connection to music in Russian as opposed to Ukrainian and Belarusian.




It doesn’t even matter if I’m talking about a piece of music, a movie, or an animation studio, and it doesn’t matter if it’s completely unrelated to politics. My culture is treated as INHERENTLY being connected to politicians and regimes, and as such, forever tained, in a way that American culture NEVER is.

I think this is quite similar to the way some other cultures are treated. For example, Hebrew language Israeli culture will automatically get hate and boycots in half of the world, because people WILL treat it as political, and the person would have to ""explain"" and ""excuse"" themselves for the events in Palestine, even though the French or Germans absolutely won't be treated in the same way.

Overall, I find the dynamic quite biased, I'd even say Eurocentric and colonial. It isn't a coincidence that the cultures that are ""global"" and NEVER ""political"" are those from Western European or European settler nations.




What makes it even worse is that this bias doesn’t just come from Westerners. I mean, it would've already be bad if this unfairness would only be found in Western spaces, but nope. You really can't feel safe from controversy even in post-Soviet spaces, unfortunately.


I’ve had conversations with fellow Belarusians, Ukrainians, and others from the region, and the moment I bring up Soviet culture, they immediately start talking about Stalin or totalitarianism. Why does everything have to come back to politics? Why can’t I just enjoy the culture I grew up with without it being framed as “loyalty to the regime” or “nostalgia for oppression”?



What really bothers me is the huge hypocrisy around language and identity. Nobody asks Americans or Brits why they’re not listening to music in Welsh, Irish, Hawaiian, Maori, Cherokee, or Yupik. Nobody accuses them of supporting colonialism for enjoying culture in English. But Belarusians and Ukrainians like me are constantly criticized for enjoying Russian-speaking culture. We’re told we’re betraying our national identity, even though Russian-speaking culture is just as much a part of our heritage as Anglophone culture is for Americans.

Ironically, there was actually *more* cultural content in Belarusian or Ukrainian in the Soviet Union than there in Indigenous languages in English-speaking countries. Yet, there isn't any ""controversy"" abou them searching for English-speaking content!



Honestly, I even believe that this huge politization can create a very big vicious cycle. There are people for who the Soviet culture and identity is very important for their own cultural heritage, especially the elderly, and since they feel like they can’t celebrate their own cultural heritage without being attacked, they're pushed towards either completely rejecting it or feeling forced to defend it politically. I've seen many elderly people who grew up in the Soviet Union start justifying objectively terrible aspects of the USSR—not because they actually support those things, but because they feel like their personal identity and childhood memories are under attack. It’s understandable tbh. Americans would probably also act in a similar fashion if confronted with such a choice. Unfortunately, this only creates more polarization and support for extremism.






Why though, can someone explain? WHY do I have to justify loving MY OWN culture? Why do I need to create an entire political ideology just to defend my right to enjoy the music, movies, and art that shaped my childhood? This isn’t something Anglophones have to deal with. They can just enjoy their culture without being interrogated about its history. I don’t see Americans being forced to constantly condemn their country’s atrocities before being “allowed” to share their culture with the world. 




Unfortunately though, this double standard has real-world consequences. It isn't ""just"" angry people getting mad online.

My dream would be to create new Soviet style animations and movies today.

But where though? Ukraine is unfortunately unsafe, and I woudn't want to work in a country like Belarus and Russia which do absolutely terrible atrocities to other post-Soviet populations. So I'll have to operate in the diaspora. For example, I think about creating this project in Poland.

I also think it would be very cool to create such movies, cartoons and music and actually try to globalize it, in the same way that Anglophone stuff is. Creating dubbings, promoting it around the world, etc.


But the thing is, if I want to create something related to my culture, whether it’s a Russian-speaking boy band or a studio making Soviet-inspired animations — I know there’s a good chance I’ll face backlash. Nationalists might try to “cancel” me, even if there’s absolutely nothing political about my work. I would probably get death threats all over social media.

I feel like I have to walk on eggshells, which Anglophones and Westerners don't, regardless of the atrocities of their governments.



Meanwhile, Anglophone creators can go anywhere in the world and succeed. Their culture is accepted everywhere. Even if the UK and USA had huge political crisis or even just disappeared overnight, they could easily just move to Sweden or Malta and continue creating the exact same thing they did for years, and still stay popular internationally.




Apparently, my culture is getting ohased out as outdated and controversial.
Meanwhile, not only isn't American and Anglophone culture getting phased out, it's only expanding even more, further and further. Regardless of what actions the US or UK do, and how many wars they start, more people than ever watch Netflix and listen to English bands.







Overall, I even feel that I NEED to create an ideology to justify my cultural preferences and projects. That's not the only reason of course, but one of the main ones.


Because, unfortunately, if I'd ever want to create a Soviet cultural revival or to globalize Russian-speaking culture internationally, I absolutely know that I'll necessarily get attcked ans harrassed by a lot of people, but obviously not if I'll want to promote Anglophone culture.


Since I know I'll probably get a whole lot of hatred, I already need to anticipate in advance and need some quick response to stand my personal position. Not a thousands explainings and apologies, but a strong position to not let them gain any legitimacy. And yes, a new, inclusive, pro-peaceful and inclusive Soviet national identity might work greatly for that role.




Overall, what I want to say, is that I didn't choose my government, nor the government of other post-Soviet states.

I also generally hate them, but yet, I love my own culture just as much as Americans love theirs, and I also want to contribute to it, as well as to share and to spread it to the wider world, just as much as Americans, or others like Japanese do.

And I really don't think that political events to which I have almost zero control over should be the deciding factor about whether my culture should be globally represented or not.

I mean, I believe that if I were an American, and my country would collapse, with successor states waging wars against each other, I still woudn't want the entire legacy and traditions of all the American genres, like Pop, Rock, Rap, Road Trips movies, Sitcoms, as well as Disney cartoons to become relegated to the trash bin of history, or at best, to be seen as something merely from the oudated past, ""U.S. Era culture"" that should become extinct. Nope, they'd want to continue that legacy and to create new artworks related to these long established traditions.


As such, I want my culture to be free of this constant political baggage, and I want to celebrate it without being judged or attacked, in the same way American culture is, instead of being held to an impossible high standard.

patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,Liberal Socialism is contradictory. So is State Capitalism. The Austrian guy from Germany in 1935…,"Was in fact telling the truth when he said his party were national socialists. Nationalism is tied to the state. Patriotism is not.

Lots of spicy tea today. So if liberalism is complete freedom of speech and freedom to do as one pleases except maybe the obvious such as murder as that’s infringing on another. Then you can not be a liberal socialism, but why?! I hear all the angry socialists cry. Well because if socialism by the literal dictionary and historical definition and I’ll use all definitions recognised by political philosophers.

Collective ownership ship of the means of production.
Public ownership of the means of production
Community ownership of the means of production
State ownership of the means of production

No socialist can deny that actually all 4 of these sentences mean the same thing when applied to our democratic republic structure. The problem being of course, that none of these things excludes the people with the highest power. Therefore when socialists wrongly apply this as proof as worker ownership they are in fact wrong because the highest worker is the worker in the government. Aka the president or prime minister. We know for certain that they more often that not do not apply the wishes of the people to their management of the state. And there for if this is true then none of these 4 sentences can mean “we the people” we the people being you average joe blogs that works for a living. 

But actually socialisation of people and the economy comes from top down and not down up, because if we are being truthful, they are not subservient to us. Thus. Socialism is not for we the people. It is for people in places of power because the highest common denominator of public is the head of state.

patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,"Fascism and Capitalism: The Same Beast – Why Antifa's ""Greater Evil"" Narrative is Dangerous","It’s time to get something straight: Fascism is intrinsic to capitalism. I know this isn’t a popular take in some circles, especially among groups like Antifa, but the reality is that fascism is not some external threat that can be defeated in isolation. Instead, it’s a direct consequence of the contradictions within the capitalist system. The ideologies that fascism promotes—god, family, and nationality—are not just incidental features. They are the very structures that capitalism needs to maintain its stability and order.

When organisations like Antifa treat fascism as a “greater evil” that is somehow separate from capitalism, they completely miss the point. They’re allowing revisionist ideologies like Anarchism, Social Democracy, and even liberalism to thrive in the vacuum they create. Let’s unpack this, shall we?

Capitalism is built on exploitation and inequality. It thrives by extracting value from the working class to benefit the capitalist class. But here’s the thing: capitalism is inherently unstable. Economic crises, overproduction, class struggle—these things can threaten the system. When the contradictions of capitalism become too glaring to ignore, fascism often emerges as the solution.

Fascism is capitalism's emergency response to its own contradictions. It is a tool for the capitalist class to maintain control when their traditional methods (like bourgeois democracy) are no longer enough to suppress the working class. It enforces authoritarian control, ramps up state violence, and strengthens social hierarchies—all in service of protecting capitalist relations of production. Fascism doesn’t exist outside of capitalism, it emerges from it as a necessary mechanism to defend the status quo.

So when organisations like Antifa call fascism the “greater evil,” they’re not seeing the big picture. Fascism isn’t an “outlier” to be stamped out; it’s part of the system. It’s capitalism showing its true face when the usual methods of ideological control and pacification no longer work.

Now let’s talk about the ideologies that fascism leans on to maintain social order: god, family, and nationality.

\- God: Religion has always played a key role in supporting capitalist systems. Whether it’s the promise of rewards in the afterlife or the reinforcement of submission to authority, religion is a tool of social control. Fascism uses religion to ensure obedience to both the state and the economic system. It tells workers to endure their suffering, because a better life awaits them in heaven. The idea that God’s will is behind social hierarchies (like the domination of the wealthy over the poor) reinforces the naturalness of exploitation. In this sense, fascism and capitalism are deeply aligned.

\- Family: Fascism’s obsession with the “traditional family” is no accident. The nuclear family mirrors capitalist relations in microcosm: a clear division of roles, the subordination of women (traditionally to bear and raise the next generation of workers), and the perpetuation of private property. The nuclear family supports the system by keeping the working class atomised—workers are isolated within their homes, distracted by personal and familial concerns, and less likely to organise collectively for revolutionary change.

\- Nationality: Nationalism is another key ideological tool that fascism shares with capitalism. The capitalist system requires nation-states to organise the global economy, manage trade, and control resources. Nationalism divides the working class by emphasising borders and the supposed interests of national identity over common class interests. Nationalism encourages workers to focus on “patriotism” rather than realising that they share more in common with workers in other nations than they do with the wealthy elites within their own.

This isn’t just some random set of values fascism pulls out of thin air—these values reinforce the stability of capitalist society. They work to maintain the social order that allows capitalism to function smoothly. Fascism doesn’t reject these values; it elevates them to ensure that the masses are kept in line, focusing on religion, family, and national identity while the ruling class continues to exploit them. The most frustrating thing about the current wave of Antifa’s rhetoric is how they frame fascism as a “greater evil,” something outside of the capitalist system. They act as though defeating fascism will somehow solve the problem of capitalism—as if smashing the fascists means we’ll live in a just society. But that’s a dangerous oversimplification.

By portraying fascism as an isolated force separate from capitalism, Antifa is inadvertently letting capitalism off the hook. They’re fighting the symptoms of capitalism—the fascist outbreaks—but not the disease itself. What happens when fascism is defeated? Is capitalism going to magically stop exploiting workers? Will class inequality cease to exist? Of course not. Fascism is a product of capitalist crises, and unless we address the underlying system that causes those crises, fascism will keep returning. By focusing only on fascism as the “greater evil,” Antifa is creating an ideological vacuum that leaves room for revisionist ideologies to flourish. What’s worse is that by focusing on fascism as the primary threat, they allow revisionist ideologies like Anarchism, Social Democracy, and even liberalism to grow unchecked.

\- Anarchism often talks about smashing the state, but too many anarchists ignore the fact that the capitalist system itself is the true problem rather than a central authority. A revolution that ignores the economic base of capitalism—the mode of production—will only ever result in fragmented, uncoordinated revolts that don’t fundamentally challenge the power dynamics of capitalism.

\- Social Democracy is even more dangerous. By treating fascism as the greater evil, social democrats think they can reform capitalism and solve the problem through welfare programmes and “democratic” means. But fascism doesn’t just come from the extremes; it emerges when capitalism’s contradictions reach a breaking point, and the state’s democratic mechanisms fail. The solution isn’t to tweak the system; it’s to dismantle it entirely.

\- Liberalism, of course, wants to maintain capitalism with just a few social policies here and there. But by focusing exclusively on the “fascist” threat, liberals ignore the fact that capitalism in its current form—whether it’s liberal, fascist, or social democratic—is still exploitative and unequal. A system that divides people by class, race, and wealth is always going to produce authoritarian outcomes, whether they come in the form of fascism or another flavour of bourgeois control.

We can’t keep falling into this trap of thinking that fascism is some separate evil that can be defeated on its own. Fascism is a tool of capitalism. It’s capitalism's emergency response when its contradictions threaten to unravel the system. If we want to end fascism, we must end capitalism.

The goal isn’t just to fight fascism. It’s to abolish the capitalist system that allows fascism to emerge in the first place. Until we recognise that fascism is intrinsic to capitalism, we’ll keep fighting symptoms instead of the root cause. Fighting capitalism means fighting fascism, nationalism, patriarchy, and every other tool that upholds the system of exploitation.

So, to all those pushing the “greater evil” narrative—stop falling for the illusion that fascism is some rogue ideology that can be isolated and defeated. It's time to recognise the deep, inseparable link between fascism and capitalism. Only when we destroy the capitalist mode of production can we truly be free of fascism and any of the other evils that it brings with it.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1gtbc7a/fascism_and_capitalism_the_same_beast_why_antifas/,1731841793.0,1gtbc7a

patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,"Re: ""Is Fidel Castro a hero?""","A recreational essay on the state of Cuba today.  
  
The two biggest factors that have created the Cuban condition over the past few decades, but particularly have led up to the severity and worsening state of the Cuban people living in Cuba today – including the growing intensity of poverty and regular struggles of day to day life for Cubans that have not been seen in Cuba since the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s; resource, food, goods and commodity shortages; severe inflation; lack of Cuban liberties, freedom, allowance of dissent, and a genuine democracy; and a growing Cuban exodus, today surpassing any previous numbers of a Cuban exodus leaving the country in history (especially in relevance to historic Cuban-U.S. emigration) – have all been significantly in part caused by two large factors. First, and I think the biggest and most important influence and cause, is the suffocating, oppressive, imperialistic sanctions of the U.S. over Cuba since the Cuban Revolution, and other covert and violent U.S. imperialistic interferences since then. Ranging from CIA civilian bomings of innocent Cubans and attempted coups and invasions post-Cuban Revolution, to a much larger influence even before the Cuban Revolution has begun to take place amongst a large majority of the Cuban people. The U.S. hegemony has had a very significant power rule over Cuba since Cuban sovereignty was given to the U.S. by Spain in 1898 after the Cuban Wars of Independence. During which the U.S. occupied Cuba from 1898 to 1902, and this post-war period was a very hard time for the Cuban people in material conditions. As well as a sad and defeating blow to the Cuban people as their sovereignty, freedom and ideals which they fought for against Spain throughout the period of three wars and three decades since 1868, was then just given to the U.S. right after the Cuban War of Independence. As the U.S. agreed to help Cuba in its fight against Spain, with obviously selfish ulterior motives in the end. Afterwards, the nonnegotiable U.S. Platt Amendment was established in 1903 as the Cuban Republic was founded. The U.S. declared in the one-sided “treaty” its own right to control and intervene in Cuban affairs for the next three decades, under the guise and justification of ""protecting Cuban welfare and independence"". In the irony of especially the last word “independence”, the U.S. during this time used this as an excuse to exploit Cuba, and protect U.S. interest in the country for their own selfish control of power, and economic and financial gain. The Platt Amendment gave the U.S. control over Cuba’s domestic, foreign and economic policy; allowed for insider U.S. investments and profit within Cuban industries; and the selfish control over Cuba's trade and the allowance of Cuba’s international relations and diplomacy with other countries. This was until the relinquishing of the Platt Amendment in 1934, and ever since then the U.S. has still exercised influence and control over Cuba against the wishes of sovereignty for the country by the Cuban people. A prime example of this was the positioning and support of Cuba's previous dictator, Fulgencio Batista, who was a big ally and prop in the Cuban government by the U.S. for decades, who allowed for tremendous amounts of corrupt U.S. investments and profit in Cuba during this time. This is also similar to other U.S. interventions throughout the early 20th century of positioning and backing politicians in Cuba that were favorable to the U.S., and inseminating opposition and historic interference to those who were not. This was until the turn of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, where there on after the birth of a new establishment and government – and the continuation of a popular movement amongst the Cuban people within the country – deeply despised and positioned itself against the U.S. and Western imperialism and influence. This triggered the U.S. to strike back against a nation that was defending itself for its sovereignty against the imperialistic influence of the U.S., and in 1962 under John F. Kennedy, were the beginning of sanctions and an embargo placed over Cuba in response to Cuba's declaration to becoming an anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. sovereign entity. Of course, which the U.S. did not like nor take lightly for its infliction to its long and significant U.S. profit and control within the country, and as history shows, the U.S. would be relentless in its sovereignty-based immoral efforts and economic violence it has since imposed on the Cuban people. The Cuban people who have directly reaped the impacts of a devastating economic chokehold and hugely impacting U.S.-Cuban embargo since then. Even moreso, it is incredibly ironic, but exactly parallel to what has been seen elsewhere in the world in other places the U.S. has occupied, imperialized, influenced, and even later tried to invade and coup as the U.S. tried to do to a sovereign Cuba: was the development and motives that led to the Castro regime and government. The anti-U.S. and anti-imperialist sentiment and establishment that was grown in the country throughout the Cuban Revolution was the resurgence of the Cuban movement for sovereignty and true independence. Especially after the U.S.-backed Fulgencio Batista coup of 1952, which placed Batista as a dictator head of the state after he shut down free elections and opposition in the country (very similar to Fidel Castro soon later). This long history of corruption, oppression and resentment of the U.S. interfering in Cuba for its own benefits is what led to the eventual birth of Fidel Castro’s take to power and establishment in Cuba. The very pinnacle of American rhetoric when talking about Cuba and the authoritarian government of Fidel Castro, which the U.S. virtually inspired and helped pave the way for... A huge disruption and typical example used of a country that opposed the imperialism and influence of the U.S. hegemony, and somewhat fought against it longer than most other countries. This influence that the U.S. has had over Cuba all throughout the 20th century, and most certainly still today, have drastically hampered and restricted Cuba's ability to grow to its full potential. Especially limiting the potential for the Cuban people themselves to live better, easier, and more comfortable lives in their own country, as a sovereign nation who is still struggling against the ongoing 62 years of a crippling and suffocating embargo at the behest of the U.S. state. An embargo that directly impacts, disenfranchises, and hurts the Cuban people more than anything else.  
  
However, all of that being said, this does not exempt or excuse the actions of this next reason, or give the righteousness for the entirety of the actions and impacts that Fidel Castro and his government has had over Cuba, and especially the Cuban people. The second reason for the state of Cuba today being that the government of Cuba that has developed after the Cuban Revolution under Fidel Castro has had immense influence on the Cuban state and people since. This is despite a worse, actually murderous, silencing, elitist and corrupt government and dictatorship under the U.S.-backed, American sellout and U.S. mafia ally that was Fulgencio Batista, as the Cuban prime minister and dictator before Fidel Castro. Castro first initially stopped public, democratic elections from occurring in his political position of power after assuming the position of prime minister in Cuba, after he overthrew Batista in 1959 in the armed uprising of the Cuban Revolution. From there on, what became a silencing and oppressive, authoritarian state that historically put persecuted people in UMAP forced labor agricultural camps that served as an alternative to required military service at the time, which had been controversially referred as ""concentration camps"" by some, but abusive at best (targeting gay and queer men, religious minorities, and communist objectors). Held state executions, however historically only occurring in mass following the revolution in the 1959 executions of previous Batista police and military personnel, which was likened at the time to the Nuremberg trials of Nazi soldiers post-WWII just a decade before, and of which had an overwhelming support from the Cuban people in a credible 1959 poll of 93% of Cubans in support of the executions and trials. Yet nonetheless of which had also been subject to not only the violent torture of acclaimed separate individuals from Batista affiliation including dissenting activists, artists, and non-Batista personnel, but also the murders of these individuals as well in the greater executions of Batista ""henchmen"" and his violent military presiding over the country during his administration and influence. On the latter, there was and has been significant silencing of dissent against the state in Cuba, including the lengthy, cruel, and repressive jailings in the tens of thousands of Cubans who had publicly protested and openly criticized the state, and the deportation of these same citizens and journalists. As well as another huge disservice to the Cuban people falling short of the aspired country that was fought for, of which still has modern existence today, with the creation of a falsity of democracy in Cuba, and the deceptive so-called ""democratic"" elections that have been held in the country seen through a multitude of different facets in the government for decades now. From the political enforcement of the country being a one-party system under the “Cuban Communist Party”, adhering to no tolerance or allowance in the government for opposing ideological parties or deviation of opinions or voices, and historically neither in the press or media, the public eye, or the public arts and literature. As well as the creation of the CCP's ""loyalist and communist vetting"" National Candidacy Commission, which is responsible for deeming a Cuban citizen ""eligible"" or not to run for political office at the whim of whether they are deemed “patriotic and Communist” enough, and selectively handpicks the candidates eligible for running for political office. Furthermore, the ""one candidate per seat"" elections which function within the National Assembly, that have furthermore never once seen a political candidate in the history of the Cuban National Assembly ever lose their run for their one candidate congressional seat. To explain plainly, because there are no actual opposition candidates for these one candidate seats being held in these acclaimed ""democratic"" national elections in the unicameral Cuban legislature. On top of this, these National Assembly ""elections” are also conducted through representative voting, where these same representatives were also hand picked and first vetted by the CCP. So once moving past local municipal elections, Cubans no longer have any actual vote or direct impact upon larger provincial or national elections, or these upper-level candidates that make up the country’s most influential and highest level of government, that is the national legislative body of the Cuban National Assembly. Additional lies of the state have existed as well through the historic campaigning rhetoric and administration propaganda from Fidel Castro and the CCP throughout the Cuban Revolution. Despite speaking of ""solving inequalities and intense poverty” in Cuba, which historically in positive accomplishments have led to better literacy, better healthcare, and the narrowing of the extreme gaps of poverty and class in the country - has infamously over the last six decades created a life with less civil liberties and freedoms for the Cuban people, and an overarching larger caste of an impoverished and struggling middle class juxtaposed to the wealthier and most comfortable upper class of the Cuban government and its circle (however, with an extreme influence as well from external sources of an U.S. embargo and sanctions heavily adding to this outcome of a more uniformed classwide impoverishment, and still with a racially seen class inequality). As well as the hugely oppressive social influences on Cubans ranging from severely encumbering, restricting, and prohibiting the allowance for Cubans to immigrate and leave the country, freely come and go from Cuba for traveling purposes, or simply visit their own family and friends inside or outside the country’s borders. Prohibit the allowance for Cubans to work independently within Cuba or own their own businesses or property, such as the seizing of all public businesses and property of Cuban citizens that occurred after the Cuban Revolution when Fidel Castro took office as prime minister without a public or national election. As well as simply the threat of not being able to speak or advocate freely as citizens in their own country without facing state punishments such as jailings of sentences ranging up to decades long for the most ridiculous and minor acts of dissent or criticism against the state.  
  
However, until just in recent years there has been social progress in the country allowing for the introduction of limited private businesses and limited property ownership to exist for Cubans, yet with the penalty of heavy taxing on these private businesses. As well as the progress of more allowance of social commentary and freedom for criticism of the state. However, despite a shameful crackdown of the recent protests in 2021 during COVID-19, where thousands of Cubans protesting in Havana made the largest anti-government demonstrations in Cuba since the Cuban Revolution in 1959. Yet these protests ended with hundreds of Cubans charged and arrested with crimes for protesting in this demonstration against the growing unrest and conditions in Cuba, and even a handful of Cubans were injured and a range of one to possibly five Cubans had been killed during clashes with police in these protests. In spite of this, there has been social progress in the country over the years as Cuba has definitely developed and changed over the decades. Yet still certainly slower change in some areas than others, and still a lot of unrest and struggles felt by Cubans today in Cuba. Especially as the years go on and the younger generations of Cubans continue to grow in progressiveness and in their aspirations for what they want their country to look like, along with the Cuban population over the years in general. As well as with the growth of social media and the global connectedness that this has allowed between Cubans and the rest of the world, particularly moving Cubans to want their country to be more interconnected in the global scene, and the benefits of growing access to the internet throughout Cuba that has definitely been very influential over the past two decades.  
  
Today in Cuba since 2020 and COVID-19, the Cuban economy and citizen’s day to day comfort of life has been at an all time low since the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, and almost the entirety of the Cuban population work wages for state jobs that are very low. No matter the education level or profession, whether working as a doctor or a teacher, the average monthly salary for Cubans has roughly been at $25 a month as it has been for years now. Because of such minimal adequacy of life living off of these state wages, even working high level professions and going to school, Cubans often work side jobs in the “underground economy” doing work in the tourism sector. Some even leave their state jobs to go do work such as taxi driving for tourists, which can make a Cuban taxi driver over twice the amount of the average monthly state wage in a single day. As well as ration cards that Cubans receive for food are met with incredibly long lines where Cubans have to wait for hours in, and food rations given to Cubans are minimal for the Cuban citizens and families who rely on them, yet they still provide the minimum of food to keep Cubans fed throughout the country. Especially nowadays with growing shortages of common day supplies, food, and important resources in the country that Cubans are not sure when will be in stock next, this makes the already struggling and hard working lives of the Cuban population that much harder. Where the majority of Cubans live below the poverty line, and many of whom often eat minimal meals with what they find at markets. Cuban emigration is even at an all time high that has not been seen since the turn of the Cuban Revolution. More and more Cubans over the years have been saving money that they can spare over months and years of working, waiting in cues of immigration systems that can take just as long, or having to resort to alternate and sometimes more dangerous methods and routes of travel throughout other parts of the region as immigration in Cuba and the U.S. has increasingly been backed up in recent years. Money remittances can also especially be important in this process and to many Cubans in general, particularly those who are fortunate enough to have already family immigrated overseas such as in the U.S., who can send them money and supplies that help make many Cuban’s lives living in Cuba easier. As well as being able to receive help with saving up to emigrate out of Cuba as some Cubans choose, and seek easier lives and opportunities elsewhere as a new and resurging Cuban exodus has continued to grow and be seen in the hundreds of thousands migrating to the U.S. and elsewhere in the world every year.  
  
The Cuban state of struggle and poverty today is something that has grown and fluctuated over the years, but after the COVID-19 pandemic has only gone downhill. It is crucial to understand though at the end of the day, what has been driving the state of Cuba and the average Cuban livelihood and struggle for decades now, has been the U.S. imperialistic, selfish, and sickening embargo on Cuba. Which hasn’t worked for its intended purposes of discouraging the Cuban Communist Party, but has only worsened the struggle and poverty of the Cuban families who have lived there through the generations. So much power in an economic chokehold that the island’s biggest neighbor has placed on the small country for its citizens to take the fall for and have to suffer. Withholding the import of goods and the American dollar, which can drastically change the lives of Cubans immensely for the better, if it wasn’t for the continuation of the U.S. greed, self interest, and apathy of rich politicians for the Cuban people. Politicians who consistently, and without a shred of guilt, vote every year to put the people of the small island through a continuing six decade hell, because that same island’s government has openly and vocally opposed itself to the capitalist and imperialist history and coercion that America insists to reclaim over Cuba. At the behest of a violent and everlasting economic ransom on the small island of Cuba, against the outcries, and the useless, empty word condemnations of the rest of the world’s nation leaders… Along with this important aspect to the Cuban struggle and plight, however, the consistency and faults of the Cuban government’s legacy and Castro regime have continued to grow a larger, severely struggling and impoverished middle class in the country, met with oppressive and violent silencing, and the disenfranchisement of liberties and people’s livelihood since the Cuban Revolution. Now existing as a stark juxtaposition to the dreamy revolutionary campaigns and words of the Communist Party during the Cuban Revolution, and the comfortable lives of the Castro circle and Communist party members who live lavishly in power - while the common Cuban struggles today more than ever before in the last 30 years, more Cubans seek to leave Cuba than has ever been seen since the Cuban Revolution, and the Cubans throughout Cuba struggle to get by with what their closest neighboring country and own government’s creation has made their lives out to be. A life of hardships; but persistence, fight, and joy that Cubans never leave behind. The Cuban joy and culture – well, that is a whole other essay to write.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/12ze92k/re_is_fidel_castro_a_hero/,1682507638.0,12ze92k
patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,“The Case for Tariffs” Is Undermined by the Protectionism and Not Simple Revenue Generation,"  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwgims-R9lY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwgims-R9lY)

[https://anthonygalli.medium.com/the-case-for-tariffs-90bf47e08ed8](https://anthonygalli.medium.com/the-case-for-tariffs-90bf47e08ed8)

Around a year ago, a small Republican YouTuber by name of Anthony Galli published a YouTube video titled “The Case for Tariffs”. which was a recording of his Medium article of the same name. At first glance, the video comes across as fairly ideologically consistent. The author says he doesn’t support open borders in order to maintain the nation, but that doesn’t mean they are a xenophobe. He extends this logic to trade and says that just because he wants to tax foreigners for the sake of having borders, that doesn’t make him a protectionist. This is fair. Immigration simply being labor entering the country in economic terms, it could very well be argued that ostensibly pro-free trade Republicans who support immigration restrictions are ideologically inconsistent and he just wants to extend the logic to its conclusions, logical or illogical as they may be. This would explain why devout followers of Ayn Rand, known as Objectivists, are pro-free trade and open borders.

It is after this that the script goes a bit off track. He said he was not a protectionist, yet he goes on to state how during the Industrial Revolution, America had the most protected economy in the world with tariffs between 20% and 50% and that by 1916, we were the most powerful country in history. No mention is made of the widely agreed upon economic consensus that America experienced that growth in spite of the tariffs, not because of them. There was a respect for property rights, a gigantic free trade zone in the form of the United States, and most importantly, the cost of shipping goods had plummeted in the post-Civil War period. He says this, along with a mentioning of how we flooded the markets of other countries with our goods after 1916 by pressuring them to lower their tariffs and that by the 1970s, we had become a victim of our own free trade by being able to export factories overseas. Nothing protectionist-sounding about any of this. All the same, Mr. Galli is not wrong to say that a tariff for revenue generation would be better than income, corporate, payroll taxes, or doubtless much of the other 97 federal taxes. He then quotes Ron Paul in *End the Fed* saying how a uniform tariff is constitutional and would be preferable to income or value-added taxes. Very good, but as we’ll see, the proposal Galli makes is not for a uniform tariff, but one that depends largely on the conduct of governments of potential exporters to America.

So, what’s Galli’s proposal? A uniform 10% tariff. That may sound a bit steep, but it would indeed be constitutional and lay it out on the table that the “rich”, “corporations”, or “employers” do not pay taxes, but the consumers do. This the logic behind the recent Republican calls for a national 23% sales tax, known as the Fair Tax. A 10% tax on imports or a 23% tax on all sales? The choice is clear. So, what went wrong with the rest of the proposal? Well, he then proposes an additional 5%-10% “tyranny tariff” for countries that prohibit free speech, such as Russia, China, and Iran. As shown with the federal government’s drive to prosecute Julian Assange over Woodrow Wilson’s tyrannical 1917 Espionage Act, the United States is really in a position to be lecturing other countries on free speech at the moment. Still, even this would amount to a lower tax than the 23% sales tax the Fair Tax would cause and it would for sure be preferable to armed conflict and sanctions. Why the United States could not just adopt Switzerland’s foreign policy of total non-interventionism isn’t addressed, but that’s beyond the scope of this article. Thankfully, Galli does not mean these tariffs to increase revenue, but just make it so a greater portion of federal revenue comes from them over other taxes. Very well, but things soon go full-on protectionist and beyond revenue generation and free speech promotion.

Galli says tariffs would reduce our trade deficit. Perhaps, but as Thomas Sowell famously put it, a person should be as worried about the trade deficit as they should being randomly struck by lightning. As Robert Solow put it, most of us have a trade deficit with our barbers. We pay them to cut our hair and they don’t buy anything from us. What is the problem? That the federal deficit fuels the trade deficit? That’s a very real issue, but the solution there is a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. Getting spending under control is the real issue at play there. No one would deny that the high-time preference federal politicians are not in the business of living beyond the next election cycle. Blaming reckless spending on ostensible free trade that America ostensibly has seems oversimplified and perhaps even a bit protectionist.

We then get a call for tariffs because of American patriotism and the country’s heritage of tariffs. Indeed, the Hamilton Tariff of 1789 was one of the first pieces of legislation signed into law by George Washington. This was for revenue generation only and it wasn’t until 1816 that America had its first protectionist tariff passed. He then sings the praises of the protectionism that was in vogue throughout the 19th century. The American System was favored by Whigs and Republicans then, but that didn’t make support of free trade unpatriotic, as shown by its popularity with America’s large rural base at the time. Indeed, quoting the 1896 Republican Party platform is especially ironic because William McKinley was running against the openly pro-free trade William Jennings Bryan. The patriotic tariffs were infamously hammering his farmer base.

The author’s sixth, seventh, and eighth arguments that tariffs are harder to avoid, that they can promote national security in the case of defense, and that the U.S. federal government will inevitably give preferential treatment to American companies are all largely sound. It’s the third, fourth, and fifth points that need further substantiation. The third point was that economies grow faster by having protectionism, with the export-oriented East Asian Tigers being contrasted with the ostensibly free trade Africa. It is not clear how 17.8% average tariff Gambia, 17.6% average tariff Djibouti, or 16.4% average tariff Central African Republic and Chad are “free trade”, but alright. Ha-Joon Chang seemed a very odd choice of an economist for a non-protectionist to cite. In short, countries grew in spite of tariffs, not because of them. Concerning the fourth point that tariffs attract manufacturing, it seems China was chosen for low labor costs and lower taxes, not for trade policies. Finally, while tariffs indeed decentralize power compared to a federal income tax, they still can provoke feelings of revolt, as shown with the 1828 Nullification Crisis in South Carolina. All in all, the uniform 10% tariff proposal would be fine as a replacement for worse federal taxes, but the protectionist rhetoric and sources, such as Ha-Joon Chang or the Economic Policy Institute, undermine the premise. Seeing them quoted alongside Ron Paul was unique. No question.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/12kuubd/the_case_for_tariffs_is_undermined_by_the/,1681403518.0,12kuubd
patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,"You Wouldn’t Know It Today, But Religious Zealots Used to Love American Public Schools","  A humorous and most likely satirical Minion meme went around a few years ago showing two images: the top one was a Minion appearing happy in front of an American flag with a gold cross over it and the caption was: “Your Child (age 6) before public education”. Below it was a depiction of a gruff-looking Minion, sporting a mustache, with a cigarette hanging out of its mouth, wearing a ushanka, with the Soviet Union’s flag in the background and the caption read: “Your Child (age 7) after 1 year of public education”. The joke here was clearly to poke fun at how religious zealots in America today, such as then Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, generally dislike public education because a religious education is not included as it would violate the First Amendment and the unions of public schools often donate money to the Democratic Party, so hyperbolic parents might therefore try to argue that they are thus teaching communism to children at said schools. While the meme was almost certainly made by a secular supporter of public schools, who was mocking their perceived extremist religious and conservative beliefs, as well as their incontestably insufferable love of Minions memes, it is because of the slight possibility that the meme was not satire that the following should be pointed out: religious zealots in America once loved public schools and fought tooth and nail against private schools, particularly in the State of Oregon.

In 1922, the State of Oregon was very much like what we might think of the Deep South as being like today: devoutly Protestant, anti-immigration, unabashedly racist (as shown with it being illegal for African Americans to live in the state until 1926), obsessed with American nationalism and making sure that children were raised to be, in their view at least, sufficiently patriotic, and even containing a not insignificant Ku Klux Klan population. Even though that wave of immigration had been occurring since the 1880s, this was still a concern because it was before the Immigration Act of 1924 was signed and no one knew when the perceived horror of non-Protestants entering the country would end. It was worried that the immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, who, though then only a fraction of the state’s population, could still find their war to the Pacific Northwest, and potentially might not assimilate into the Protestant lifestyle that America was ostensibly founded on. In 1920, 13% of Oregon’s population of 814,000 were immigrants, only 8% of the population as a whole was Roman Catholic, and only 7% of schoolchildren in the state attended private schools. So, despite Catholics, immigrants, and private school attendees being minute compared to Oregon’s population as a whole, the fact that three-quarters of private schools in the state were run by the Catholic Church was enough to prompt the Masonic Grand Lodge of Oregon to call for a referendum on whether or not all school-age children should be mandated to attend public schools. With the support of the Democratic gubernatorial candidate and soon-to-be Governor of Oregon, Walter M. Pierce, as well as the state’s branch of the Ku Klux Klan, the Compulsory Education Law referendum was approved by 52.7% of voters, with 115,506 in favor 103,685 opposed.

In a bout of democracy going wrong to a degree rivalling what happened to Socrates, the Oregon School Law, officially known as the Compulsory Education Act, went into effect and by September 1, 1926, Catholics, as well as parents of attendees of other private and military schools would have to face the consequences. If they had a child between the ages of eight and sixteen, they would have no choice but to place them in a public school, where they would receive what was perceived to be a proper, “Americanizing”, Protestant education. Not surprisingly, this major assault on the freedom of parents provoked a backlash, not just locally, but nationally, as Catholics across the country felt under attack by a law forbidding their religion from being taught and that had received support from the unabashedly anti-Catholic Ku Klux Klan. By March of 1925, this law was being challenged in the United States Supreme Court in the case of *Pierce v. Society of Sisters*. The law was unanimously declared to be unconstitutional for violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The civil liberties guaranteed by that amendment were deemed to have been trampled on the by the voters of Oregon, as a parent deciding where their child was educated was ruled a civil liberty. The mood of the court was succinctly summarized by Associate Justice James Clark McReynolds, when he wrote that “the child is not the mere creature of the state”. The scheme of religious zealots was never able to come to pass.

So, what is to be made of this today? Well, most evidently, it shows that advocates of religious education have not always been the scheming followers of Milton Friedman, who just want to funnel public money to for-profit schools to enrich their friends and set the stage for a theocratic, Christian nationalist free market vision of America, or however public school supporters might frame these Betsy DeVos types. At the same time, it shows that public school supporters today could be negatively associated with the Oregon Compulsory Education Law and they may find themselves in a guilt-by-association situation. It would most likely be Catholics doing this today, as Protestants would likely be embarrassed by their ancestors supporting public schools, as well as the suspect organizations that supported the law.  Ultimately, it shows that support of the state ebbs and flows among certain groups when the special interests it is supporting changes.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/11m139s/you_wouldnt_know_it_today_but_religious_zealots/,1678293617.0,11m139s
patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,"War and Peace: ""For German Victory!"" Critical Campism was missing during the German Unification of 1870-1871 and the Franco-Prussian War. (Also on Parvus and Lenin)","In earlier threads on war and peace, the [four basic positions](https://www.reddit.com/r/demsocialists/comments/ydk71y/war_and_peace_intro_to_political_positions/) on the left were laid out: defencism, pacifism, dual defeatism, and campism.  [Current events were alluded to, as well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/yz67ux/war_and_peace_political_positions_groups_and/)

It's a real shame critical campism from a Marxist perspective was born during the industrial bloodbath of WWI, rather than much earlier.  The correct time for *foreigners* to have been supportive of both defeat for Anglo-dominated imperialism and victory for Germany would have been in 1870-1871, during the German Unification and the Franco-Prussian War.

As we now know, it is a multipolar world, not a unipolar world, that has given class movements in multiple countries political momentum. You don't have to read fascist trash from Dugin to appreciate this.  1870-1871 saw, to use a Chinese anachronism, the Great Rejuvenation of the German Nation, with Prussian Characteristics.  1870-1871 saw the realization of this through, to use a Russian anachronism, a Special Military Operation.

Well before the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union, the historically first ""lesser evil imperialist power"" to provide critical support was Imperial Germany, trying to stick it to Anglo-dominated imperialism, its accomplice in French imperialism, and their combined colonial shit. [Friedrich Engels himself suggested conditional support for Imperial Germany if it were attacked.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1891/letters/91_09_29.htm)

So what if the Kaiser and Bismarck started the war?  So what if what would become Imperial Germany was the aggressor?

First of all, this was not a war of colonial expansionism, which should remain condemned on the left.  This was an inter-imperialist war, and included in this are proxy wars.

Second, the crucial timing that needs to be emphasized is whether there's a revolutionary period for the working class or not. If it's not a revolutionary period, a solid case can be made for critical campist support for the ""lesser evil imperialist power"" in the name of geopolitical realpolitik. If it is a revolutionary period, however, critical campism would be wholly inappropriate.

The Lassallean ADAV got it right by supporting the Prussian war effort all the way to the end.

Karl ""John Kerry"" Marx got it wrong. He supported German unification under Bismarck in 1870-1871, then flipped-flopped long before the notorious Iraq War flip-flopper John Kerry was born. It was not a revolutionary period for the working class. Moreover, Prussian victory, or Imperial German victory, was a key catalyst to none other than the Paris Commune.  Spotlights on police brutality and ""abolition of the police,"" combined with alternative organs of law enforcement, would not have been possible without this German victory.  Other political measures would not have been popularized as easily without, to use another Russian anachronism, the demobilization and de-Napoleonization of the Second French Empire.  The hard political lesson of not going easy on the banks would not have been learned without, to use another another Chinese anachronism, *pressured* unification with renegade provinces throughout Germany.

[Said German territories were not real countries, anyway.]

Both August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, the Eisenachers, got it worse!  They should have been like the Lassallean ADAV, ""social patriots"" in German unification at France's expense. Instead, they voted against war. It was their anti-unification antics - scum antics - that brought about the Anti-Socialist Laws.

Above all, the Great Rejuvenation of the German Nation, with Prussian Characteristics, via Special Military Operation, did not have people outside the future Imperial Germany, other than German emigres like Marx and Engels, be supportive of both defeat for Anglo-dominated imperialism and victory for Germany.  This was unfortunate, as this world-historical event ushered in a multipolar world!

[Unironically, as geopolitical neo-Prussianism is the highly-educated evolution of campism.]

On the other hand, the first Marxist campist got his German support woefully wrong.  The Russian exile [Alexander Parvus supported both a Russian defeat and a German victory](https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1025/parvus-for-german-victory/) after 1900, in the midst of WWI.  Although he rooted against his ""country"" of birth because he saw the German Empire as the ""lesser evil"" imperialist power compared to Anglo-dominated imperialism, developments after 1900 made things clear that it was a revolutionary period for the working class; WWI broke out too late.

Furthermore, even Lenin himself [considered seriously becoming a ""fritzie,"" only to back off](https://reformandrevolution.org/2022/05/11/was-lenin-a-campist/).  He backed off from the stance that defeat of Czarist Russia by Imperial Germany was the lesser evil.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/115yr8b/war_and_peace_for_german_victory_critical_campism/,1676772601.0,115yr8b
patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,[Statists] The Illegitimacy of the state: The Social Contract myth and the Constitution,"I haven't seen these anarchist criticisms of the state on this sub so I'm doing it myself. Apologies for the length, but there are a lot of points to hit.

In discussions about the legitimacy of the state, one of the first things to be brought up is the social contract. The idea that there is an implicit agreement between members of a society to give up certain individual rights in exchange for creating systems necessary to sustain said society.

Naming this theory the “social contract"" is a misnomer. The so-called social contract is not a contract at all.

Some of the most important features of a legitimate contract are as follows:

* all terms are explicit
* both parties have the chance to negotiate
* the contract will state the amount of time in which the terms are valid
* you explicitly agree by signing

None of these features are present in the social contract.

If you agree with the concept that people need to give up certain rights to maintain a society, then you can accomplish this in a legitimate way. When you agree to live in an apartment for example, you agree to the terms of a legitimate contract that restrict certain rights. No smoking, no pets, no loud music etc.

The social contract isn't inherently legitimate or moral.

There is no other relationship in your life that functions the same way as your relationship to the government. If you tried to take someone to court over a contract that was constructed the same way as the social contract, you would be laughed out of the courtroom. Why should the state be held to a different standard than a private relationship?

So, the social contract is supposed to be the major thing that binds the citizens to the government.

But what do we have that outlines the government's role in all of this?

The constitution.

The constitution is rarely brought up anymore, however it was supposed to be one of the critical foundations of the state.

The constitution resembles a real contract in some minor ways. Certainly more so than the social contract. It was, at least, laid out in explicit terms and signed by someone.

These terms were meant to reign in government power and protect individual rights, but the constitution has clearly failed that mission as the government violates the constitution all the time:

* Every single gun law violates the 2nd amendment
* The patriot act violates the 4th
* Red flag laws violate the 5th
* Indefinite detention violates the 6th
* Civil asset forfeiture violates the 7th
* Enhanced interrogation violates the 8th

And I could go on and on...

The Supreme Court “interprets” amendments to say what they want. Supreme Court justices are nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate. Obviously politicians wouldn’t confirm a justice that interferes with their goals. Even if this is to the detriment of the people. The constitution is very inconvenient to those in power.

""Emergency powers"" are declared to justify unconstitutional acts.

People are labeled as “terrorists” in order to violate their rights.

Clearly, words on a piece of paper are completely impotent in limiting government power. No matter how strictly and clearly you word something, there is always a way around it for the government.  Everything is up for interpretation. There are no chains strong enough to prevent government overreach. There is no such thing as checks and balances. The government has been violating the constitution for hundreds of years, this is not a recent trend. The constitution was dead on arrival. Given a long enough timeline, all governments eventually trend towards authoritarianism.

The founding fathers would be appalled by what the government they designed had become. And in the same way, you would be appalled in a few hundred years by any government you can design.

So, the foundations of the state are essentially this:

On one hand of the agreement, you have the illegitimate social contract that is implied and vague binding the people to the government. This vague abstraction is the justification for the people to comply with laws and pay taxes to the government.

And on the other, you have the constitution that sort of resembles a real contract, but the other party is under no true obligation to follow and can violate it at will, as we have seen. The people suffer punishment if they violate the social contract, while the government continually violates the constitution to the point that it’s hardly even mentioned anymore.

I don’t know how this obviously uneven and unjust structure makes sense to anyone. You would never allow another party to violate a contract as repeatedly as the government has violated the constitution.

Any statist must have a structure in place for how their ideal government would be kept from authoritarianism, as governments are the only forces in the world capable of the mass murder of millions of people. History shows us that no such structure exists.

Statism is the theory that, you can create an unstoppable monster and then control the monster simply with a sign on the wall that says “don’t do bad stuff”.

Some common arguments:

“So what if the social contract isn’t the same as a private contract? This is still the only way to maintain a society”

* Your views on how to build the best society are totally irrelevant. At some point in history, most people thought that society couldn’t exist without a monarchy. That wasn’t true then and it’s not true now. You have no moral grounds for imposing your worldview on everyone at the point of a gun. 

""Taxes are the price you pay to live in a society. Civilization cannot function without them.""

* That's nothing more than an opinion. I would argue that there are many ways to arrange a society that don’t require taxes in the current form. Everyone has their own idea on what society needs to function, but again nothing gives you the moral right to impose that opinion on everyone. Even if the above is true, where do you get the authority to impose that on the unwilling portions of the population? This idea that you know what is best for other people and that it needs to be enforced on them, even if it’s against their will, is dangerous and should not be normalized. This line of thinking inevitably leads to authoritarianism.

“You consent to the government/taxation by living here “

* Occupying a certain geographic location doesn’t automatically sign you up for a contract at birth. That’s not how consent works. There's no other contract or relationship in your life that operates like that.

“If you don’t want to pay taxes or be under the control of the state, you can just leave the country”

* You’re in no position to be making demands or giving ultimatums. It would be like if a gang member told you that you have to pay him money if you want to run a business on his turf. The issue is not whether the business owner should or can leave, it’s about the gang member trying to extort him.

“You can negotiate through voting”

* My rights are not up for discussion, not up for debate and they certainly aren’t up for a vote. I can only “negotiate” as long as the policies I want are popular among my neighbors. Popularity doesn't mean something is right or moral. People can and have voted away the rights of minority groups many times. Deciding to elect a representative to take someone’s rights away, is no different than a dictator deciding to do the same. Voting is not a get out of jail free card for taking other people’s rights and imposing your views on to them through the power of the state. People voted for a senile old man to be president and now he is making decisions that impact the lives of millions of people. If that doesn’t show you how ridiculous democracy is, I don’t know what to tell you.

So, what is it that makes the state legitimate at this point? It seems like there are no real answers to that question other than ""this is the best way to organize a society whether you like it or not"". And for some reason we accept that batshit crazy worldview as legitimate. The state as we know it is a primitive and outdated relic from the past. The future is decentralized. The state as we know it is clearly a shitty, one sided, deal with an unfaithful actor not holding up their end of the bargain that people are gaslit into believing is legitimate and fair. People need to give up on the idea that the state is redeemable.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/wh1t7t/statists_the_illegitimacy_of_the_state_the_social/,1659721912.0,wh1t7t
patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,Why I prefer a Monarchy over Socialism and Capitalism,"I am not a monarchist in a way that I don't think its some sacred system, but I prefer an absolute monarchy to democracy or to dictatorship. Cause a king has a link to the country - he passes it to his son. The modern top elite on the other hand don't give a f-ck about the country, only their pockets and in our time they can just move their children and grandchildren to another country. An ordinary people, the same as the monarch are mostly tied with their country. They, the same as kings are patriots that know their history, are proud of it and try to make it better.  That is a new reality. Before in the past, the corrupt elite was homogeneous, shared the same culture and therefore were patriotic to some degree. That's why democracies worked in the past. But today's ""democracy"" with all its ""checks and balances"" has only one purpose - to shield an elite's corruption that is ruining ordinary people's income and success. Only an absolute monarchy with unlimited power can penetrate that ""shield"" checking the elite and at the same time will take care of the country because it's their country and their children will inherit it. No system is perfect because humans are not perfect but today an absolute monarchy would be the best choice. The only problem is - it will never happen cause the elite brainwashed the population that democracy is the only way to govern.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/htz3xy/why_i_prefer_a_monarchy_over_socialism_and/,1595158602.0,htz3xy
patriot,CapitalismVSocialism,Centralist vs. Decentralist Approaches,"In many countries there is a fight going on between two factions: Centralists and Decentralists. In Europe, this tends to be (narrowly) framed in the Pro-EU vs. Eurosceptic debate, in the US it seems to be more of a liberal/neocon vs. paleoconservative/libertarian thing (correct me if you think I'm wrong!).

Centralists tend to see a problem (fiscal issues, integration/assimilation problems, inefficient government, bad education) and blame it on too much decentralization or on the federalist system if one exists. They tend to be in favor of increasing the power of national or supranational (EU) structures.

A good example (in my view) is the [push for an EU-wide welfare state](http://www.friendsofeurope.org/media/uploads/2014/10/03-03-14-Report-SocialUnion-FINAL-V-2.pdf). As welfare states are collapsing because they have overstayed their official sell-by date (30 years according to experts in the 1950s) and are over-utilized by the population, they want to move them higher up in the hierarchy to allow more cross-subsidization.

Decentralists are people who want to return power back to regional or even more granular structures. They form a spectrum from federalists to ancaps. They find that having different regions try out different approaches makes everyone happier, because it is much easier to move to another jurisdiction, and improves government efficiency by reducing bureaucracy, increasing accountability and providing a ""testing ground"" for different, sometimes contradictory, approaches to government. It also encourages peace and more laissez-faire approaches because local governments have to watch out for capital drain.

Ironically, there has been an idea floating around within EU institutions that would have implemented a more decentralized approach: The [""Europe of Regions""](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/10/europe-twilight-nationalismsecession.html). However, this approach has largely fallen by the wayside in favor of straight centralism.

EU leaders seem to simultaneously fight against nationalism and then turn around and try to impose a sort of ""European Nationalism"" (which is nonsense because half of the European countries are not in the EU anyways).

I personally am anti-nationalist, save for regional patriotism, which would be perfectly in line with the ""Europe of Regions"" plan. While nationalism is not necessarily an economic matter in itself, it has historically led to wars of centralized nation states against each other, which have wrecked economies and living standards. Imagine our living standards today had WW1 and WW2 never happened.

What is your opinion on this issue? Do you fall on the spectrum I outlined here, and if so, where? I would be especially interested in the opinions of left-anarchists and nationalists (including nationalist ancaps), but of course anyone can reply.

elites,CapitalismVSocialism,What even is exploitation and private property?,"Marxists like to say that capitalism is exploitative. Exploitation, in a broad sense, is defined as 'an agent who has an asymmetric relationship with another agent taking advantage of them,' and they say that capitalism is intrinsically exploitative. Marxists tend to use a more technical definition of exploitation, but let's use the broader one.

In the USSR, workers received wages and not the value of their labor, and factories were managed by directors appointed by the Communist Party. In China, some companies adopt the 996 system, working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.

Aren’t these unequal economic advantages? If we use their own technical criterion, a truly socialist society has never existed in history. That is, of course, unless you redefine what exploitation is.

But then a Marxist from their basement will come and tell me:

""Erm, but see, it’s not exploitation because the surplus value goes to the state managed by the workers, not the bourgeois 🤓☝️""

OK, and what makes the state actually owned by the workers?

""Erm, the state says it is owned by the workers 🤓☝️""

That’s like saying the Bible is the word of God because the Bible says it is the word of God.

""No, but see, there was no private property in the USSR 🤓☝️""

I don’t know, man, the mansions the Party elite had don’t look like collective property, nor the Western goods they had that were inaccessible to the average Soviet.

""No no, but we don’t call that private property, we call it personal property 🤓☝️""

elites,CapitalismVSocialism,Property rights help the working class,"For most of history, property was the privilege of nobles. Land ownership brought political authority, while peasants and workers had no legal standing. When the working classes gained property rights after periods of political upheaval, political power soon followed.

In the United States, small property holders formed a bulwark against entrenched power, first abroad and then at home. The overarching theme of American history is the gradual expansion of property rights in practice. As rights spread, more people could own land, start businesses, and save capital. This gave ordinary citizens leverage against elites and fueled a consumer revolution: demand from newly enriched masses spurred production, which in turn widened prosperity. It was a feedback loop of growth and political inclusion.

Other nations followed similar paths. In 19th-century Germany, access to credit and savings helped drive one of the fastest industrial takeoffs in history. After 1945, Japan abolished feudal tenancy, turned millions of farmers into landowners, and within a generation became an industrial powerhouse. Where property rights were secured, workers gained independence and real political voice.

By contrast, Lenin’s promise of “land to the tiller” quickly culminated in collectivization and requisitioning. Peasants lost their independence and became dependent on the state for survival, paving the way for repression and famine. Without property rights, obedience becomes the only protection.

Capitalism is hardly perfect, but history shows that property rights, extended universally rather than monopolized by elites, have been a mechanism of self-emancipation for workers. If not property, then what prevents socialism from turning workers into clients of the state?",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1mvs4nd/property_rights_help_the_working_class/,1755725741.0,1mvs4nd
elites,CapitalismVSocialism,Capitalism Brings Innovation - The Gilded Age,"The Gilded Age in the United States, spanning roughly from the 1870s to about 1900, is recognised as a period of remarkable innovation and invention. This era was characterised not just by economic growth, but also by a surge of technological advancements that fundamentally reshaped American life and global industry.

Some of the major inventions and innovations of the Gilded Age include:

* The telephone by Alexander Graham Bell (1876) revolutionised communication.

* Thomas Edison’s inventions, notably the phonograph (1877) and the electric light bulb (1879), transformed entertainment and daily living.

* The Kodak camera (1888) by George Eastman made photography accessible to the public.

* The development of steel mass-production techniques (Bessemer process) catalysed the growth of railways, skyscrapers, and bridges.

* Elisha Otis’s elevator and the rise of skyscrapers, enabling urban development and population concentration in cities.

* Innovations in transportation such as safer, more efficient railroads and, toward the end of the period, the early automobile and the first successful airplane flights.

During this time, over 500,000 patents were issued between 1860 and 1890, more than ten times the previous seventy years, underscoring the era's reputation as an age of unprecedented innovation.

elites,CapitalismVSocialism,The embargo ain't an Excuse anymore.,"i honestly don't know what Cuba expected it to happen after expropriating billions of dollars and nationalizing American companies with no gain for the United States and did constant anti-American propaganda. The only reason they haven't falled before was soviet union. And just like them, They hide poverty and the scarcity of the public sector with propaganda. From 2022 to now, like 9% of cuban population escaped from there and risked his life to reach Florida. and considering how much Cuban propaganda only shows the negative sides of the West, it is not clear how it is possible that people flee from a country where they are so well off for a country that, as far as they know, is hell. 

But now let's see:

According to OEC 2022, Cuba sell it's products to:
34,1% to china 
12,3% to Spain 
6,5 to germany
4,6% to Swiss 

These countries import to Cuba: 
Spain – ~23.6 %  

China – ~12.7 %  

Netherlands – ~9.8 %  

United States – ~9.2 %  

Canada – ~5.5 %  

So also here, usa trade with Cuba.

Now the most funny part is, the difference between the dominant public sector, and that small portion of the private sector (reserved for the Cuban government elite and tourists) in those small doses, it generates about 15% of Cuba's GDP.

Municipal services (waste, water, transport) Public Public services such as waste collection and repairs are often inefficient, with widespread corruption and long waits. “Tolerated” situations such as paying extra for the service – alleviating inefficiencies – create disparities in the quality of care. The private sector can offer quick solutions but they cost money, are often informal and accessible only to those with resources; there is no clear regulation.
 
Food, Tourism & Small Businesses

Public

State-run shops and restaurants often have limited stock and low service quality.

Public transport and tourism infrastructure are outdated and poorly maintained.

Private restaurants (paladares), vacation rentals, and markets usually offer higher quality, more variety, and better customer service.

However, private businesses face tight regulation and arbitrary inspections.

Salaries in the private sector can be 10–15 times higher than in the public sector, leading to a talent drain.

Before anyone say something, i'm not saying that embargo haven't caused problems. I'm not saying that Cuba even with that problems, should be the first country for quality of life in the world. I'm not saying that socialism is intrinsically failing.

elites,CapitalismVSocialism,Why Socialism/Leftism Cannot Obtain Equality & How to Combat Them,"Social progressive movements, socialism, and anarchy create a privileged group that must be upheld, with the idea that by giving them power and/or privilege, it will trickle down (Reganomics-style) to everyone else. Leftists combine this with the Bibi Netanyahu approach to equality: the idea that group x has been harmed so badly, that by definition the only response is to create oppression of their own, which will in turn trickle down to benefit everyone else:

**For instance:**

* **Socialism:** Why can't socialists agree who is socialist, and who isn't? Largely because the differences come down to which formerly oppressed group must lord over society. The mob rule of workers, some say. Others say it should be a Vanguard-like party, made up of elites who know the best for the workers. Either way the results are the same.
* **Anarchists:** Of course, anarchists create the conditions for the privileged ruling group being the strong. Who can ensure that the ""principles"" of anarchy are being upheld, so that groups don't form that oppose such positions and create hierarchies? Those strong enough too.
* **Feminism:** The idea that women, wronged by society, should be first and foremost in creating the conditions for equality by focusing specifically on their rights. Read this book if you have time which advocates for this.
* **Race-centered movements:** Same as feminism, but focused on a race being the privileged group, and that focusing on them will trickle down an equal society to everyone else.

**The solution:**

I used to say that corny line, ""I may disagree with your views but I'd die for your right to believe it."" Step one is to knock off this nonsense. Absolutely not. If you defend those who wish to destroy you, you're a fool. So don't.

The next step is to work to pit these groups against each other. Naturally, leftist groups will always fight each other out of purity, but such divisions can be accelerated. Join your local leftist organization, in person (risky) or do it online, and say things that will cause divisions that will eventually become unbreakable.

* “Funny how it’s always the white organizers speaking first.” (If you are a person of color who supports fighting leftism, I can't express how necessary it is for you to do this). 
* “If you’re not vegan, you’re not truly anti-capitalist.”
* “I heard leadership is Trotskyist/Stalinist/Anarchist"" or whatever the group hates
* Promote things, like bad slogans that the American people hate
* In time, they will defeat themselves, and they may retrospect on how it was bad actors, but no one will believe them anyways.

elites,CapitalismVSocialism,The U.S. Never Really Tried “Real Capitalism” It’s Been Crony Oligarchy All Along? - (It’s Not Capitalism vs. Communism – It’s Power vs. People),"Bold claim? Absolutely. But hear me out: the United States has never truly experienced the pure, free-market capitalism we learn about in textbooks. Instead, what we’ve had is a corrupted framework a system partway between market and state, bent by oligarchic power and nepotistic favoritism. Long post, there is a TLDR at the end.

Capitalism as Utopia vs. Reality

In theory, capitalism is almost utopian in its simplicity: free markets, private ownership, voluntary exchange, and zero government meddling. Laissez-faire, baby – let the invisible hand do its magic. Textbook capitalism is **“an economic system characterised by [a] lack of government intervention”**. Prices rise and fall with supply and demand, firms compete freely, and the best products at the best prices win. The ideal assumes no bailouts, no subsidies, no favoritism – just pure competition and merit.

Reality check: Such a pristine free market has never existed in the U.S. (or arguably anywhere). Even economists note that what we call “capitalist” economies are really mixed economies with significant government involvement. From the nation’s early days, government and business have been entwined – for better or worse. Tariffs, land grants to railroads, subsidies to farmers, central banking, you name it – the hand of the state has always been on the scales. The purest form of capitalism tends to crack under real-world pressures (even pro-market analysts admit the Great Depression broke that ideal). So the “Capitalism” we practice has always been a blend – and that blend has often been tipped in favor of the powerful.

The Free Market Myth and Government Meddling

One pillar of true capitalism is that government stays out of the economy. In the U.S., however, government intervention is not the exception but the rule – and often it’s steered by those with money. Corporate lobbyists swarm Washington D.C., ensuring policies tilt toward incumbents and the rich. Companies and trade groups spend billions each year lobbying Congress and federal agencies. In 2024 alone, lobbying hit a record $4.4 billion in spending – hardly a level playing field or “hands-off” government. When laws and regulations are written by those with the deepest pockets, the “free market” is free in name only.

Consider how tax laws brim with loopholes that only major corporations exploit, or how regulations often exempt well-connected firms. Through campaign donations and lobbying, big businesses gain preferential treatment – from lucrative government contracts to industry-friendly regulations. This isn’t a conspiracy theory; it’s documented fact. A Princeton University study of 1,779 policy decisions found that **economic elites and business interest groups have a massive influence on U.S. policy, while average citizens have **“little or no independent influence”****. In plainer terms: government listens to the rich and organized, and largely ignores the rest of us. When policies consistently favor a wealthy minority (be it tax breaks for hedge fund managers or subsidies for oil companies), can we really call the system “free-market capitalism”? It looks more like plutocracy – rule by the rich.

Moreover, government intervention often explicitly props up businesses that should fail in a truly free market. Think of the 2008 financial bailout: banks that had gambled themselves to insolvency were rescued by taxpayers. That’s not the invisible hand; that’s a very visible hand picking winners. As one observer put it at the time, after “the largest government bail-out in history,” U.S. leaders still lectured others about free markets – the irony was palpable. We effectively have socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor: when regular folks mess up, they face foreclosure and bankruptcy; when billion-dollar firms mess up, they get a government lifeline. This kind of corporate welfare is the antithesis of true capitalism, which would let failing firms fail.

Crony Capitalism: When Markets Meet Oligarchy

What do you call a system where big businesses succeed not through fair competition but through cozy relationships with government officials? Economists have a term: crony capitalism. It describes an economy where companies thrive via collusion with the political class rather than via free enterprise. Sound familiar? The U.S. system checks a lot of these boxes. Corporations hire armies of lobbyists, often former politicians (the “revolving door”), to bend rules in their favor. They secure tax breaks, govrnment grants, and regulations that hinder smaller competitors. In a true free market, if you innovate you win – in a crony market, if you have friends in high places you win.

This has led many to argue that what we have in America isn’t capitalism as much as it is oligarchy – rule by a wealthy few. Let’s clarify definitions: Oligarchy means **“government by the few… a small and privileged group for corrupt or selfish purposes.”** In a functioning capitalist democracy, wealth is gained by serving consumers, and political power is checked by votes. But when the wealthy can effectively buy political influence, economic power converts into political power – creating a de facto oligarchy of the ultra-rich. Wealth concentration in the U.S. is staggering: as of 2021, the top 1% of households held about 31% of all wealth, while the bottom 50% of Americans owned only **2.6%**. Such extreme inequality isn’t just a statistic – it translates into outsized influence. Billionaires can fund candidates, PACs, think tanks, and media outlets to protect their interests. When a handful of mega-donors and corporate giants set the agenda, that’s oligarchic power in action, not the egalitarian competition capitalism ideally promises.

Historical perspective drives this point home. In late 19th-century America – the Gilded Age – a few industrialists (the “robber barons”) dominated entire sectors. John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil is the classic example. By 1880, Standard Oil controlled 90–95% of all oil refining in the U.S. – basically an oil empire under one man. This monopoly didn’t happen just by being the best in a fair market; Rockefeller cut secret deals with railroads and aggressively swallowed competitors, leveraging every advantage to stifle competition. It worked – too well. The concentration of economic power was so blatant that the U.S. government (prodded by public outrage) finally intervened. Using the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the Supreme Court broke up Standard Oil in 1911 into 34 pieces. Think about that: if the U.S. had a truly capitalist free market, one company could never corner 90% of an industry – rivals would spring up and undercut it. But the reality was that unchecked capitalism birthed an oligarchic behemoth, and only government action (ironically) restored some competition. In short, it took intervention to fix the distortion caused by too much concentrated power.

Standard Oil wasn’t an isolated case. The early 20th century saw steel trusts, railroad trusts, banking cartels – small elites controlling huge shares of the economy. The fact that we needed antitrust laws is proof that markets left alone don’t always self-correct their slide toward oligopoly. And even after trust-busting, the cycle continued. Fast-forward to mid-20th century: President Esenhower warned in 1961 of the “military-industrial complex” gaining “unwarranted influence” and “misplaced power” over American policy. He was talking about defense contractors and Pentagon brass forming an elite clique that could warp national priorities (like, say, perpetuating costly wars) for profit. In other words, Ike saw an oligarchic threat in the cozy ties between big defense firms and government. His warning that this power **“will persist”** rings true today whenever we notice how defense, pharma, tech, or Wall Street seem to get their way in Washington.

Capitalism vs. Oligarchy: Parallels to Communism vs. Dictatorship

Here’s a provocative comparison: Capitalism in theory vs. capitalism in practice is a bit like communism in theory vs. communism in practice. On paper, communism imagines a classless utopia where the state “withers away” and the people collectively own everything. In reality, every attempt at communism has resulted in a dictatorship of a powerful few. The Soviet Union, for example, started with calls for worker equality but quickly devolved into Stalin’s brutal dictatorship, with purges and tens of millions of deaths in the name of maintaining control. The pattern: a system that intends to abolish concentrated power ends up concentrating power in a single party or leader.

Similarly, capitalism intends to diffuse economic power via competition, but in practice it often concentrates power in monopolies and oligarchs. Over time, wealthy individuals and companies can gain disproportionate control, not just over markets but over governments – turning the system into the very opposite of a free competitive marketplace. We’ve seen it outside the U.S. as well: when the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia embraced “capitalism” overnight in the 1990s, only to see a few well-connected businessmen snatch up former state assets and become billionaire oligarchs. After the fall of communism, “oligarchs… appeared throughout the former Soviet Union”, amassing enormous fortunes and power from the chaos. Instead of a free market utopia, Russia got crony capitalism on steroids – a small clique controlling oil, gas, and banks, welding influence much like the old Politburo, just without the communist slogans.

The lesson: Both extreme systems—pure capitalism and pure communism—tend toward power concentration if unchecked. Capitalism isn’t supposed to be an oligarchy, just as communism isn’t supposed to be a dictatorship, but that’s often what happens. Why? Because human nature and power. If a system allows power to pool, it will pool, whether it’s economic power or political power. In communism, party bosses hog power; in capitalism, corporate bosses do. Different ideologies, similar outcome: a tiny group running the show.

It’s worth noting nepotism plays a role here too. Oligarchic systems perpetuate themselves through family and networks. Wealthy families in the U.S. (the kind who fund think tanks and super PACs) often have their scions in influential positions. Political dynasties (Bushes, Clintons, Kennedys, Trumps) and the revolving door between government and industry mean that the same faces rotate in and out of power. High-level officials craft regulations today and then get hired by the industries they regulated tomorrow – or vice versa. When who-you-know trumps what-you-do, that’s nepotistic flavoring in our economic stew. It’s not meritocratic competition; it’s aristocracy by another name.

Historical and Modern Evidence of a Rigged System

To drive the point home, let’s bullet through some key evidence from U.S. history and recent experience showing how “real capitalism” gets undermined:

Gilded Age Monopolies (1870s–1900): As mentioned, giants like Standard Oil and U.S. Steel dominated markets. The very existence of antitrust laws (Sherman Act 1890, Clayton Act 1914) was a reaction to rampant monopolistic abuse – essentially the government saying “we need to referee this game or the bullies take over.” True free-market capitalism shouldn’t need such laws (competition would naturally prevent one firm from ruling all), but reality proved otherwise.

The New Deal Era (1930s): After the laissez-faire Roaring Twenties led to the 1929 crash and Great Depression, the U.S. didn’t sit back and let the market self-correct. Instead, FDR unleashed a wave of government intervention – from bank regulation (Glass-Steagall) to public works and social security – to save the economy. It was an explicit admission that unfettered capitalism had failed spectacularly for millions. Market purists were essentially overruled by the desperate need to stabilize the country. In pure capitalism, such massive state intervention would be heresy; in practice it was necessary.

Military-Industrial Complex (post WWII): The U.S. emerged from WWII with a booming defense industry permanently intertwined with government. Military spending and big contractors became a huge part of the economy. Eisenhower’s 1961 warning underscored that this fusion of corporate and government interests could warp policy (e.g. defense companies pushing for conflicts or big procurement programs). This is an institutionalized form of lobbying/corruption – not envelopes of cash under them table, but a legitimated influence of certain industries over public policy for decades. It’s capitalism morphing into a semi-planned economy where the planners are a private cabal of defense firms and friendly officials.

Contemporary Corporate Concentration: In today’s America, just a few firms dominate sectors like tech and finance. Big Tech is a prime example: a couple of companies essentially own social media, online search, e-commerce, and digital advertising. This mirrors the old trusts – new industries, same dynamic of winner-take-all. Congress hauls tech CEOs in for hearings about monopoly power, and antitrust cases loom, suggesting we’re repeating the cycle of the Gilded Age in a new form. Likewise, a handful of big banks control a huge chunk of banking assets; a few big players dominate health insurance in many states; two companies control most beef processing, etc. The American consumer or entrepreneur is often not operating in a truly competitive free market but against quasi-oligopolies.

Lobbying and Campaign Finance: The Citizens United Supreme Court decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for unlimited corporate and billionaire spending in elections. The result? Political spending exploded – independent expenditures in the 2012 election were nearly 600% higher than in 2008 (jumping from about $144 million to $1 billion) in the wake of Citizens United. That money isn’t coming from grassroots bake sales; it’s from wealthy donors and corporations seeking influence. Today, the cost of winning office is so high that politicians are incentivized to court the rich, aligning policies with those interests. This pay-to-play environment entrenches the power of elites at the expense of the median voter. (Recall the study above: average citizens’ preferences barely register in policy outcomes.)

Bailouts and Subsidies: Time and again, when push comes to shove, the U.S. government steps in to rescue or boost major industries. The 2008 bank bailouts (TARP) and the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary interventions saved the hides of Wall Street titans – effectively guaranteeing that Wall Street’s losses would be covered by Main Street’s taxes. During the COVID-19 crisis, the government pumped trillions into propping up corporations and markets (along with helping citizens, to be fair). And in many industries (agriculture, energy, aerospace), subsidies and favorable policies are a permanent fixture. This is not to argue whether those interventions were right or wrong morally – just to point out that they are fundamentally anti-“free-market.” It’s state intervention determining winners, often benefiting the biggest players (who have the clout to ensure they’re first in line for the rescue or the subsidy).


In sum, the evidence paints a picture of a system that uses capitalist rhetoric but often violates capitalist principles. The market isn’t allowed to work freely because those with power manipulate the rules to protect their position. Monopolies form, and rather than being discipline by competition, they are curbed (if at all) by government after the fact. Influence is bought, fairness is undermined, and the playing field is tilted.

Counterarguments (and Why They Fall Short)

Let’s address a few pushbacks that defenders of the status quo might raise:

“Markets self-correct – monopolies can’t last forever.”
Counter: It’s true that in theory, a monopoly can be disrupted by new technology or competitors. But in practice, dominant firms use every trick to entrench themselves: predatory pricing to kill nascent rivals, lobbying for regulations that raise rivals’ costs, buying out promising startups before they can threaten the throne. Maybe over a very long term, some monopolies erode (Standard Oil’s market share was down to ~64% by 1911 just from market forces). Yet even that example required a breakup via law. The “self-correction” often only happens after significant damage, or it’s nudged by policy. Relying on it is cold comfort when you’re living through the abuse of an unchecked giant. As the adage goes, markets can stay monopolistic longer than you can stay solvent waiting for them to self-correct.

“We do have free markets – look at all the small businesses.”
Counter: Sure, in many sectors (restaurants, retail, personal services) there’s healthy competition and minimal direct government interference. Capitalism does work on those levels and brings innovation and choice. The argument isn’t that no free enterprise exists, but that the overall system tilts in favor of big players. A corner coffee shop competes freely – until Starbucks moves in with vastly greater resources and maybe a tax abatement deal from the city. A startup might innovate – only to find the regulatory environment (shaped by lobbyists from an incumbent firm) raises hurdles that only big companies can easily clear (think complex compliance costs, licensing, patents litigation, high tariffs, etc.). So yes, free markets exist in pockets, but zoom out and you see a pattern: once any player becomes big enough, the game rules often get adjusted to keep them on top. The little guys compete; the big guys collude (legally or not) with power.

“Government intervention is actually what prevents true capitalism, not the rich – maybe we just need less government.”
Counter: There’s some truth here: a lot of the corruption stems from the government having favors to disprnse (contracts, laws, bailouts). If the state had no such power, firms couldn’t lobby for special treatment. However, in complex modern economies, zero government is a fantasy. The moment you have any laws or policies, powerful interests will try to shape them. Simply “less government” doesn’t automatically equal more competition – it can just mean unchecked private power. For instance, if we abolished antitrust laws and regulation tomorrow, would we get a competitive paradise? More likely, we’d see rapid consolidation as the biggest fish eat the rest (because nothing stops them). History shows that strong institutions are needed to maintain competition (breaking up monopolies, enforcing contracts fairly, etc.). Well-designed government action can counteract oligarchy (think trust-busting, anti-corruption laws), while weak or captured government lets oligarchy run wild. The answer isn’t no government or all government, but how to make governance serve the broad public, not the elites. Right now, unfortunately, a lot of government is captured by the elites – but abandoning oversight entirely would be like taking referees off the field in a rigged game.

“Capitalism has lifted millions from poverty; oligarchy is a misuse, not an inevitability.”
Counter: It’s true that competitive markets have driven innovation and growth that improved living standards enormously over centuries. This post isn’t an anti-market screed – it’s pointing out that our implementation has flaws betraying those very market principles. One can believe in capitalism’s potential while criticizing how it’s been subverted. And while oligarchy isn’t an automatic outcome, it is a highly likely outcome without checks and balances. Even fervent free-market advocates like Adam Smith were wary of business elites conspiring against the public – Smith wrote that merchants seldom gather but to “conspire against the public or raise prices.” He, and later economists, understood that ambition and greed unchecked can undermine the common good. So yes, capitalism can deliver great things, but only if we actively prevent the slide into cronyism. The U.S. thus far hasn’t been great at that prevention – it oscillates between periods of reform and periods of backsliding into oligarchy. The task is continual vigilance.


Conclusion: It’s Not Capitalism vs. Communism – It’s Power vs. People

At the end of the day, obsessing over the label “capitalist” or “socialist” misses the point. The real divide is not between capitalism and communism as ideologies, but between systems that empower a broad population vs. systems that concentrate power in the hands of a few self-serving elites. The United States, for all its free-market praise, has allowed a wealthy minority to accumulate outsized power, warping both our economy and democracy. In that sense, we’ve been living under a form of oligarchy while calling it capitalism.

This isn’t to say we should “try communism” (that has its own dismal track record of empowering elites of a different sort). Rather, it’s a call to rescue capitalism from the capitalists, so to speak – to demand a fair playing field, real competition, and a government that isn’t auctioned off to the highest bidder. Both the far-left and far-right actually share a common enemy here: the cozy clique of plutocrats and bureaucrats feathering each other’s nests at the expense of everyone else.

Until we tackle that, arguing about pure economic ideology is like debating theory in a rigged casino. The house (the oligarchs) always wins. The U.S. has the innovation, resources, and democratic ideals to do better. But first, we have to stop pretending that the corrupted system we have is the pinnacle of “capitalism.” It’s not.

Real capitalism – the kind that would be an engine of prosperity for all – remains as elusive a utopian dream. What we have in practice is a hybrid beast: part market, part captured state, with a thick layer of cronyism on top. Acknowledge that, and we can start having an honest conversation about fixing it. Keep denying it, and the powers-that-be will keep running off with the spoils while we cheer the “free market” ghost that was never quite there to begin with.

TL;DR: The U.S. hasn’t experienced a true free-market capitalist utopia – instead, rich elites have continously bent the system to their will (through lobbying, monopolies, and political influence), creating an oligarchic, crony-capitalist hybrid. Just as communism in practice led to dictatorships instesd of worker paradises, capitalism in practice often leads to oligarchies instead of competitive wonderlands. The problem isn’t which “ism” we choose, it’s allowing power to concentrate unchallenged. Time to call it like it is and deal with the real issue: power corrupts, no matter the ideology, so we the people need to keep it in check.

elites,CapitalismVSocialism,Opinions on my economic model?,"Contract, is indeed, a stepping stone towards a voluntary, free, and consensual society, which is ideal, contract doesn't force people to sign in, which is ideal, and yet, this is wrong.

Contract can be exploited in the favour of employers, as you can see, in the law, you can ask for your employer to change the contract about the working conditions, but no, changing must be consensual for both side, and according to the hierarchy (albeit a spook, according to myself), they are the employers, they're larger, wealthier, and more powerful, which they don't have any restraints to force them to change the material working conditions for you, which results in eternally exploitative working conditions. Contracts that employers forced pre-employees (in this case you're finding a job) is exploitative and thus you need a job yo survive, resulting in exploitative working conditions.

It can also happen vice-versa as employee can bids and bends contracts in their favour, exploiting entrepreneur in the process.

Consent is my no.1 concern, but as you can see, the more unimportant employer-employee relationship left a far more devastating consequences. I call for abolition of employer-employee relationship, for self-employed society and non-exploitative, mutually respectful, voluntary association, and freer society.

I believe in horizontal and voluntary cooperation. As Nick Land and Hans Hermann Hoppe theorize, they're both wrong and right, exit is a form of freedom. But mainstream opinion is also right, voice also matter. I believe in cooperation in non-exploitative way of labour, that everyone works and collaborate with each other, you don't work ""for"" someone but you work ""with"" someone, everyone is free to voice and exit with mutually inclusive contracts with each other and everyone will cooperate, this isn't necessary a socialist or capitalist framework, as this can be practiced in entrepreneurship in a business manners but also socialistic cooperatice manners. Mutually and voluntary actions in economics free exchanges without classes and full pragmatic fully negotiatiable working conditions in cooperative way for free competition and to compete with other groups within their own free, voluntary, and mutual contract between coworkers without classes in economic relation. The problem isn't consent but inherent toxicity within employer-employee relationship, and the abolition of this relation in favour of freer (yes, workers can finally be entrepreneur, I'm not that socialist) and more classless (yes, my ideal is far more horizontal and more equal, I'm not that capitalist) society

My ideal economic goal is that humans doesn't works meaningless jobs out of necessity but rather for genuine voluntary passion. Machines should replace humans in thoughtless works. While humans innovate, and think. Job market is abolished because no jobs are more needed or less needed and thus downplaying another jobs, job market is a coercive capitalist structure that place other jobs valuable than others, job market is also a big economic loss as skilled labours and professionals in skills that aren't valued by free market functions by supply and demands of job market force those skilled individuals to work jobs that doesn't match their professions, if if they rebel against job market and salary that shifts like a stock market. I believe that humanity should innovate and do what they like while letting AI do all the works because they're thoughtless. We should move not just beyond wages but job market and let people do what they are passionated in freely while works that no one's gonna do, AI's gonna do it (no one is passionate in lifting products, right?)

I believe in ultimate self-employment as both maximisation of equality and economic freedom. A rejection of subjugation not just social but economic. A rejection of subjugation by the means of rational self-interests of capitalism that cheapens capital by technology, thus liberating workers that subjugate to bourgeoisie by replacing them with machines. With the replacement of human labourers to machines, skilled workers will learns each of their respective hidden individual skills and gradually becomes entrepreneur by their own personal and spiritual professions by material conditions of technological acceleration of machines. Resulting in workers liberation, classless society, free market within the husk and system of capitalism that once enslave us. It's abolition of worker-boss relation within wealth accumulation of capitalism that affects no one anymore as workers aren't paid for making profits for somebody and this wealth accumulation become just mere unimportant but major reasons for more innovation to compete within accumulation by basic human psychology of jealousy and accumulation of resources for survival.

Mundane physical tasks like lifting items, fixing things, transportation of products, and shopkeeping will be replaced by machines. Resulting in abolition of unskilled labors, those unskilled labours are materially forced to learn skills hidden in their spirituality whether science, art, engineer, medical, mathematical, logical, philosophical, or many more. And with abolition of human labour, everyone must be self-employed and entrepreneur, resulting in abolition of class and classlessness happens under this material conditions of automation and acceleration of technocapital.

Within the condition of unemployment and absolute human proletariat with machines, those who got left behind will find a way to survive without subjugation within bourgeoisie class (because you can't, machines are cheaper, can't be violated, paid once and for all), they would eventually become self-employed. As leaving human labourers behind is actually a good thing because it liberate them to not subjugate under capitalist exploitation. Widespread technological usage under technological acceleration will results in cheaper, more efficient, and better machines that can be used by anyone (because it's widespread), which means that liberated workers will eventually become self-employed entrepreneur themselves and use machines instead of human labour. Abolishing job market in the process.

This isn't just ideal but I believe that this is the utopian direction we're talking, with rational self-interests of capitalism's machinic desire by bourgeoisie by using cheap machines instead of humans with technological acceleration will liberate workers as it replaces human labour and force those formerly labours that are jobless to developing intellectual skills and with replacement of machines, workers-boss relationship is abolished. Resulting in self-employment and entrepreneurship. Capitalism will not kill but deconstruct itself by its machinic desire, and we're their machinic organs. Capitalism revolutionize itself to socialistic classless goal.

Transition is still ongoing. The rapid technological development artificial intelligence and the usage in workplace will eventually create joblessness, and that is necessary. Joblessness will be temporary as former workers are forced to learn new hidden intellectual skills, lost interests since childhood unconscious memories, or to love a new thing they didn't discover. They're forced to be self-employed to survive in Thai system as capitalist organs still functions.

The massive demands for technology will create a collapse within free markets and thus will create bubble burst phase when price of machines suddenly drop after skyrocket demands of machines and AI service, enforcing replacement of human labour and widespread innovation which results in acceleration that will force classlessness in later phases we mentioned before later.

Economic coordination for large sector such as roads, infrastructure, electricity, and space exploration will be handled by horizontal cooperation between each individuals or local community. It doesn't abolish jobs and economic relationships.

Technological and capital accumulation in this system will NOT create inequality, as widespread technological usage is a necessary step in reaching total self-employment. Because everyone will use machines and hire no one and machines are necessary in replacing mundane labour by humans. It's impossible for elites to creates inequality and monopoly wouldn't exist.

In the first place, yes, monopoly of technology still exists, that is necessary, but bad. Technology will inevitably be widespread as the machinic desire of capitalism to reduce costs and heighten price of its products. Yes, it will inevitably creates equality and freedom by widespread usage of technology. Demands for machines skyrockets and the price drop, results in widespread usage of cheap machines with demands that is stable and high.

Yes, and those who can't transition into self-employed people can't be real, they need to survive, and ""Lifes, uh... finds a way."" - My favourite quote in Jurassic World franchise is actually truthful, yes, those with slave mentality will find a way, and if they die, that's sad and undesirable, but if it actually exists, maybe, it's necessary.

Competition would still exists as this system operates on free market, and the classlessness compliments it as everyone have the ability to compete equally in the basis of machines production.

This is both socialistic and capitalistic, it have many capitalist structures like wealth accumulation and entrepreneurship, but also classlessness and workers liberation, by free market.

This wouldn't lead to monopoly, as widespread usage of technology will always results in technological acceleration that drives the economy forwards reducing the attempts at monopoly to zero, thus technology enables egalitarian access and equal capital to start one's education or career, which will not lead to the new hiearchy.

TL:DR The problem about inequality is not wealth accumulation but inherently toxic relationship between employers and employees. This technological acceleration by the machinic desire of capitalism will lead to classless society.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1iz9uor/opinions_on_my_economic_model/,1740639240.0,1iz9uor
elites,CapitalismVSocialism,The embargo is not the reason why Cuba is poor. ,"
One might assume that with the abundant information available on the Internet, socialists would be accurate in their statements. But no, they consistently propagate false beliefs about Cuba and other socialist countries. Furthermore, they are notorious for shifting blame onto others instead of acknowledging the dictators they admire. Whenever Cuba's misfortunes are mentioned, they frequently resort to citing the embargo as the cause. Example:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/s/G7tzBmpy7v



The emphasis placed by socialists on the embargo is primarily motivated by their strong desire to assign blame for Cuba's issues to external factors, effectively absolving the Cuban government from any responsibility. This aligns with the very same strategy employed by the Cuban regime itself, thus making it nothing more than a form of propagandistic rhetoric.This is precisely why I have written this post, outlining several misconceptions that people tend to hold regarding the US embargo on Cuba. 


1 - The embargo does not prevent trade between Cuba and other countries. Cuba has been a member of the world trade organization since 1995, and has formal relations with 160 countries.

Between 2000 and 2021 Cuba imported more than $150 billion and exported a total of $40 billion. Its main trading partners are China, Spain, Canada, Venezuela, Germany, United States, Brazil, Italy, France, Mexico. 

The top exports of Cuba are Rolled Tobacco,  Nickel Mattes, Raw Sugar, Hard Liquor  and Zinc Ore, exporting mostly to China, Spain, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. 

The top imports of Cuba are Poultry Meat, Wheat, Concentrated Milk, Crude Petroleum and Rice, importing mostly from Spain, China, United States, Canada, and Italy. 

https://oec.world/en/profile/country/cub?deltaTimeSelector1=deltaTime10&exportServicesYearsSelector=2014

One example of this:

#Spain: 

Spain is the biggest trading partner of Cuba in the EU. and the third largest foreing investor in the island after Venezuela and China, with an estimated of 300 companies. The largest number of Spanish companies deployed on the island are all those related to tourism. These range from airline companies, such as IAG or Air Europa, to hotels, such as NH hotel, Hotel Barceló, Iberostar and Melia and banks such as BBVA and Banco Sabadell.

https://www.hosteltur.com/145502_las-empresas-espanolas-en-cuba-pendientes-de-la-situacion-en-la-calle.html

Exports from Spain to Cuba (2000-2021) $18 billion.  https://oec.world/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/esp/cub/show/2021/



 
2 - ""Ships that dock in Cuba cannot go to the US for 180 days"". False. An exception to the 180 Day Rule has always been contained in 31 CFR 515.550, which excepted certain authorized shipments, as well as agricultural commodities, medicine and medical devices that would be designated as EAR 99 under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, if they were located in the U.S. A further limited exception was introduced in March 2016 via an amendment to the License Exception AVS.

In October 2016, former President Obama issued a license permitting ships that had traded to Cuba to trade with the US without waiting 180 days, so long as the only freight delivered to Cuba was non-US origin goods, that would have been designated as “EAR99,” or subject to US commerce controls only for anti-terrorism reasons. “EAR99” is shorthand for category 99 of the “Export Administration Regulations” (EAR), and consists of US or US origin items that generally do not require an export license. Most US items are EAR99, especially since 2016, when crude oil was removed from the US commerce control list.

Trump didn't rolled back that rule. As a result, currently, ships that trade most goods to Cuba can call on a US port without waiting 180 days.

3 - Investment: Between 1990 and 2000, more than $3.5 billion was invested in the tourist industry. The number of rooms available to international tourists grew from 12,000 to 35,000, and the country received a total of 10 million visitors over that period. 

Investment  by foreign private-sector and government-controlled companies in Cuba from 1990 to March 20, 1999: 

Canada $600 million

Mexico $450 million

Italy $387 million

Spain $100 million

Britain $ 50 million

France $ 50 million 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/cuba/stories/cuba072899.htm 


Between 2014, the year in which the law of foreign investment was enacted, and 2017, 175 projects worth $5.5 billion were approved; 40 new projects were agreed in 2018 for $1.5 billion (plus 30 in process), a total of 245 projects and $7 billion for an annual average of FDI of $1.4 billion. 

There is FDI in the Special Development Zone of Mariel (ZEDM). It was established in 2013 as a duty-free zone with an investment of $800 million from the Development Bank of Brazil executed by the Brazilian company Odebrecht. At the end of 2018, ZEDM had authorized investments of 41 users from 19 countries totaling $1.7 billion; out of a total of more than 400 proposals, only 15 had started operations and two had permits to start their project. According to the Cuban government, Cuba attracted nearly USD 1.9 billion in foreign investment in 2020, an increase from USD 1.7 billion in 2019. A major investment that took place was the purchase of 50% of Habanos S.A. and other premium cigar businesses for USD 1.22 billion by Hong Kong-based Instant Alliance Limited in October 2020.

In 2022 Cuba approved 30 businesses with foreign capital for an approximate amount of 402 million dollars, new businesses have been approved in the Mariel Special Development Zone (ZEDM) and 13 Hotel Management and Marketing contracts. In addition, there are advanced negotiations for more than 50 new projects worth $9 billion. In general figures, since the approval of Law 118 in 2014, 272 foreign-invested businesses outside the ZEDM and 51 within it have materialized in the Caribbean nation. Of the 321 currently active, there are 104 joint ventures, 161 international partnership contracts, and 56 wholly foreign capital companies. All these investments have achieved a total amount of committed capital investment of more than 10 billion dollars, with companies from around 40 countries. Some companies working in Cuba include: Nestlé, Adidas, Huawei, Mercedes Benz, Sherritt International, Samsung.

4 - Cars. ""Cuba cannot import cars because of the embargo. That’s why they have to rely on old cars"". False. 


Cuba has imported $1 billion in cars since the late 90s. 

https://oec.world/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/import/cub/all/178703/2021/ 

The goverment imports cars from China, France, Japan, Spain, Germany but priority is given to the tourist and diplomatic sectors. Shortly after coming to power in 1959, Cuba’s communist government led by Fidel Castro banned imports on both foreign cars and car parts. One of the inevitable effects of this policy was the deep-freeze of Cuba’s cars scene. Until 2011, cubans could only sell cars built before the 1959 revolution and needed government permition to buy modern cars from state sellers. Priority for the permits was given to people “in positions of benefit to the government”. Cubans and foreigners are not able to import their own cars.

In 2014 the government lifted its 50-year restrictions on new and used car sales. But, the state has a monopoly on sales, which means cars in Cuba are insanely expensive. While the average Cuban state worker makes roughly $20 a month in salary, one dealership in Havana is asking for $91,000 for a discontinued 206 economy car and a whopping $262,000 for a new 508 family sedan. For perspective, at $262,000, the Havana Peugeot dealer is asking more for a family sedan than its American counterparts are asking for a Bentley Continental GT ($180,000) or Ferrari 458 ($234,000), and a price on par with a new Rolls-Royce Ghost ($263,000).

5 - Internet: Cuban Internet is run by a state-owned company called Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba (ETECSA). ETECSA is the sole provider of Internet, WiFi, and telephone services in Cuba. The ICT sector remains dominated by government firms. Cubacel, a subsidiary of ETECSA, is the only mobile service provider. 

Despite improvements to technical infrastructure, the International Telecommunications Union ranks Cuba as #135 on the Global ICT Development Index. That’s the worst in Latin America and the entire Western Hemisphere. Authorities both monitor usage and work to direct traffic to the government-controlled intranet. The state engages in content-manipulation efforts and blocks independent news sites. Political dissent is punishable under a wide range of laws. 


In 2009, President Obama announced that the United States would allow American companies to provide Internet service to Cuba, and U.S. regulations were modified to encourage communication links with Cuba. The Cuban government rejected the offer, however, preferring to work instead with the Venezuelan government.

Until 2012, Cuba was connected to the Internet via old, Russian satellites—this made the connection slow and limited the amount of data that could be sent into and out of Cuba. However, in 2013 Cuba activated a fiber optic cable connected to Venezuela. On July 29, 2019, Cuba legalized private Wi-Fi in homes and businesses, although one must obtain a permit to have access.

Chinese companies have played a key part in building Cuba’s telecommunications infrastructure. China is Cuba’s primary technology providers for ETECSA. The chinese companies are; Huawei, TP-Link, and ZTE.

6 - Trade between the U.S and Cuba: The United States allows for the export of agricultural products to Cuba in conformity with the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000.  The majority of the exports are in the agricultural sector and include chicken, soybeans and corn. In 2007, the U.S. was among Cuba’s top five trading partners, and in 2008, U.S. exports of agricultural products to Cuba peaked at $684 million. The U.S. has sold more than $10 billion worth of agricultural goods to Cuba since 2000.

7 - Cuba is dictarorship. There is no democracy or different political parties. No civil, political or economic liberties. No freedom of assembly or independent press. No right to protest or speak against the goverment. This is simply the outcome of a communist regime that has held power for more than 60 years. 


8 - Remittence: In order for remittances to be sent from the United States to Cuba, Western Union partnered with Financiera Cimex (Fincimex), Cuba’s largest commercial conglomerate. Fincimex was owned by Grupo de Administración Empresarial S.A. which is led by the Revolutionary Armed Forces. The military holding company controls a significant share of the Cuban economy, spanning from hotels, car rental companies, and gas stations, to almost all retail chains on the island. As a result, research shows that for every $1 of remittances sent via Western Union and later spent in GAESA shops, the military gains 74 cents, 61 cents of which comes directly from store sales.

Although a substantial amount of remittances flow into the country each year, this money often fails to reach its intended recipients and is instead diverted by the government and the military. Instead of hard cash, citizens are given electronic dollars, which can only be used at government-owned stores with exorbitant prices.

9 - Up until 2011 cubans could not travel abroad, buy a car, own a mobile phone, buy a computer, enter a hotel, sale their house or have Internet in their homes. After Raúl Castro eased some restrictions, buying a mobile line costed 40 dollars while the average cuban salary is of $20 per month. Until 2008, the ownership of DVD equipment was banned.

10 - The 11 July 2021 protests make the government lift its own “blockade” on the amount of food, hygine products and medicine travelers could bring into the country in an apparent small concession to demands by protesters who took to the street.

11 - The Cuban government consistently flouts the embargo. Until 1992, U.S. – owned foreign subsidiaries were allowed to trade with Cuba under license by the Treasury Department. Between 1980 and the end of 1992, the value of such trade was $4.6 billion. 

However, in spite of the U.S. Trading With the Enemy Act, Cuba is purchasing American products through third-party countries. Brands like Nike, Colgate, Marlboro, Gillette, and Jordache are available, and not in some black-market back alley. They are are in the lobbies of gleaming government-run hotels. Wholesalers and distributors in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Canada routinely sell some of America’s most recognizable brands to Cuban importers. 

Cuba has for years sought out American goods as a way of thumbing its nose at the embargo. The Cuban government itself still imports the vast majority of American goods. Cuba even sends delegations on “buying missions,” hunting for specific American products in third countries for resale back home. American companies don’t authorize the to sell or distribution of any of its finished products in Cuba. But the companies don’t have the authority to prevent these type of activities in countries where Cuban import-export companies are free to operate.

Cuba also uses shell companies to deride the embargo.

12 - All the initiatives to lift the embargo and engage in cooperative efforts with Cuba have exclusively been taken by the United States, with no corresponding actions from the Cuban government. Obama’s policy of rapprochement with Cuba resulted in numerous concessions from the former, without Cuba giving in much. On the contrary, the Cuban leadership continued to criticize the US government. 

During the ""Cuban Thaw"" at the request of the Cuban goverment, the U.S.:

Removed Cuba from the list of terrorist countries. 

They stopped the ""special visas"" program for Cuban doctors working for the regime overseas so that they would not desert to the US. 

They removed dry feet wet feet. A policy that stated that any Cuban that touched land in the U.S. was to be granted rights to stay. 

The American embassy reopened. 

Obama allowed US businesses to do business with Cuba. 

How did the Cuban goverment respond? 
Fidel Castro made very clear in a letter to  students at the University of Havana, on January 26, 2015, that he opposed negotiations with the United States. And in March of 2016, he said: “Each of us is supposed to be at risk of a heart attack when we hear these words from the President of the United States (…) Let no one be under the illusion that the people of this noble and self-sacrificing country will renounce the glory and rights, and the spiritual wealth that they have gained through the development of education, science and culture (…) We don’t need the empire to give us anything.” 

Two months after President Barack Obama’s historic trip to the island the Cuban Communist Party’s Congress issued tough warnings about the need to maintain a defensive stance against what they called the United States’ continuing imperialist aspirations. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez described Obama’s visit as an “attack on the foundation of our political ideas, our history, our culture and our symbols.” President Raul Castro described the U.S. as an “enemy” seeking to seduce vulnerable sectors of society, including intellectuals and members of Cuba’s new private sector. 


13 - Money: In 63 years of revolution Cuba has received free of charge more than 300 billion dollars in cash, capital and consumer goods, ""development aid"", oil and gasoline, raw materials, machinery, technology and technical advice, weapons, donations. 

The Marshall Plan that brought Western Europe out of the devastation after World War II amounted to $13 billion at the time, equivalent to $87.1 billion in 1990 when the USSR disappeared, and $204.62 billion in 2023.

Let's do the same with Cuba. According to the online calculator Money in Time, a 1965 dollar has a value of $9.74 in 2023. One from 1975 is equivalent to $5.70, and one from 1985, when Soviet subsidies reached their maximum level, is worth $2.85 today. So, if the value of the dollar is prorated year by year, we notice that the volume of financial resources given to Cuba easily triples the Marshall Plan. 

Cuban emigrants alone have given 102 billion dollars to the Island since 1993, almost 90% from the United States. Of them, $52 billion in cash remittances, and $50 billion in packages with food, medicine and other consumer goods.

Soviet subsidies to Cuba were of 65 billion dollars between 1969 and 1990.

As for Soviet ""military aid,"" the amount is around $45 billion, according to estimates from the State Department and the CIA. Bernard Aronson, Undersecretary of State in the Government of George H. W. Bush (1989-1993), estimated that between 1985 and 1990, Soviet military aid to Cuba averaged about $1.3 billion annually, when Fidel Castro was already attacking Gorbachev's perestroika and Moscow had reduced subsidies to Cuba. 

Then came Venezuela. In 2012 alone the subsidies and investment of the Chavista dictatorship in Cuba reached 14 billion dollars. The Venezuelan government has given the Castros no less than 50 billion dollars. Mostly in oil. 

We are disregarding the loans and credits extended by different countries to Cuba, which the Cuban government has not repaid. The estimated sum equals at least $60 billion.

I am not including the investments made in the Cuban economy, which total more than $40 billion since 1990. Additionally, I am not including the sales of Cuban goods in the international market. That despite being modest, have contributed to more than $50 billion to the Cuban economy since 2000.
We are excluding also the revenue brouthg by tourism, which amount to billions of dollars each year. 

In summary, we could state that the Cuban regime has received over $400 billion since 1960. Approximately 90% of this amount was given freely by different allies and Cuban emigrants. The question arises regarding the whereabouts of this money. How is it possible that despite injecting such a substantial sum into the Cuban economy, over 80% of its population remains impoverished? How can the deteriorating buildings, unclean streets, ration cards, and the overall disastrous performance of the Cuban economy be justified? How is it possible that after 60 years Cubans have the lowest wages in the region?

The cuban economy operates on a socialist planned system. Has this system been successful elsewhere? A common occurrence when implementing such policies is shortages and the use of ration cards. Additionally, the military owns and manages all the profitable sectors in the country, making it necessary for any operation or investment to go through their hands. 

Cuba has 7 billion potential consumers for their products; however, their offerings are rather limited, consisting of tobacco, rum, and some nickel. Once again, this situation has nothing to do with the embargo, but rather stems from an inefficient and corrupt economy.

Let's consider a hypothetical scenario: what if the U.S. embargo on Cuba were lifted tomorrow? Would this action instantly resolve all of Cuba's longstanding economic and social issues? The answer is a resounding no. While lifting the embargo might lead to an influx of foreign investment and resources, it would not address the underlying structural problems that have plagued the Cuban economy and society for decades.

First and foremost, the existing government system in Cuba has been in power for over sixty years, and it is characterized by a centralized, state-controlled economy that is resistant to change. Lifting the embargo would likely inundate this system with a significant influx of money, but rather than catalyzing reform or democratization, it would reinforce the status quo. The entrenched oligarchic groups that currently control the economy, particularly the military, would be the primary beneficiaries of this financial windfall. The military not only manages the most profitable sectors of the economy, such as tourism and tobacco, but it also plays the role of shaping the political landscape of the country.

In a political environment where multi-party elections are banned and dissent can lead to severe repercussions, including lengthy prison sentences, the incentive for the government to create a more open and competitive economic system would be significantly dampened. Instead of fostering a climate of innovation and entrepreneurship, the influx of resources could further entrench the existing power structures, allowing the ruling elite to consolidate their control over the economy and suppress any potential challenges to their authority.

Moreover, lifting the embargo would lead to a scenario where the United States inadvertently becomes a financial lifeline for the Cuban regime. The resources that would flow into Cuba as a result of the embargo's removal would likely be funneled into the hands of the already affluent dictatorship, rather than being distributed to the broader population. 

In essence, while lifting the embargo might provide a temporary boost to the Cuban economy, it would not address the fundamental issues of governance, democracy, human rights, and economic inequality that have persisted for decades. Without meaningful political reform and a commitment to democratic principles, the benefits of such a policy change would be concentrated among the elite, leaving the majority of the Cuban population to grapple with the same challenges they have faced for years. Therefore, any discussion about lifting the embargo must be accompanied by a broader conversation about the need for systemic change within Cuba itself, a conversation that the Cuban government has refused to have for years. 



As to why there is an embargo. If you seize amercian property without compensation. Support communsit guerilla movements in Africa and Latin America. Formed alliances with Iran, North Korea, Russia and China. Give anti-american speeches throughout the world. Harbors Chinese and Russian spy bases. Destroy Venezuela and Nicaragua with your communist ideas and support Russia in the Ukraine war, it's only natural that the US would impose sanctions and restrictions to your country. 


It is crucial to acknowledge that the United States has the ability to remove its embargo on Cuba; however, certain conditions must first be met according to the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996:


 Waives sanctions against Cuba under this Act if the President reports to the Congress that Cuba: (1) has held free and fair elections conducted under internationally recognized observers; (2) has permitted opposition parties ample time to campaign for such elections and has permitted full access to the media to all candidates; (3) is showing respect for basic civil liberties and human rights; (4) is moving toward establishing a free market economic system; and (5) has committed itself to constitutional change that would ensure regular free and fair elections. Requires the President, if he makes such report, to take the following actions with respect to a freely-elected Cuban Government: (1) encourage the admission of such government to international organizations and financial institutions; (2) provide emergency relief during Cuba’s transition to a viable economic system; and (3) take steps to end the U.S. trade embargo of Cuba.

I'll try to ask in the best way possible: Why do some people, especially in the United States, believe that a billionaire who came from the working class is still somehow connected to that class because they faced all the struggles of the working class to reach the top, as some say? Meanwhile, a nepobaby who lost their fortune and is living on the streets is still seen as part of the elite? Just imagine someone from a wealthy family in the American elite with a prominent last name. Does a person’s origin really matter when defining which class they belong to?

elites,CapitalismVSocialism,The Media And The Mob,"""The recent riots, triggered but not caused by the Southport stabbings, have reopened the debate concerning who should have the right to disseminate information (news). The ‘establishment’ mainstream media have resumed their unceasing war against the ‘misinformation’ of social media.

At the heart of this debate lies the terror of our rulers and their media that they will lose control of the political narrative that they have monopolised for so long. They conveniently forget that their newspapers’ continual demonisation of immigrants has normalised racism for many and that in their desperation to evade EU banking rules through lying about the benefits of ‘Brexit’ it has been the mainstream media who have created the noxious racist atmosphere that fed the violence.

Loathsome internet ‘influencers’ like Tommy Robinson, Andrew Tate and Katie Hopkins would have no cultural platform were it not for the unceasing propaganda of the mainstream media. The media have created a Frankenstein monster and now that it has served its purpose they need to control and tame it. The elite of both left and right politics condemn the ‘mob’ violence without taking any responsibility for creating the toxic cultural atmosphere that made it inevitable.

‘Somebody — was it Burke? — called journalism the fourth estate. That was true at the time no doubt. But at the present moment it is the only estate. It has eaten up the other three. The Lords Temporal say nothing, the Lords Spiritual have nothing to say, and the House of Commons has nothing to say and says it. We are dominated by Journalism’ (Oscar Wilde).

This was true until very recently when those outside of the media establishment (fourth estate) discovered the internet and found their voice. The powerful have always known that the control of information and, more importantly, its interpretation, is vital to their interests. Sometimes we are told that we have a ‘free press’ but the claim that it is not ‘state owned’ in no way guarantees that it is ‘free’. Owning the mass media has always been a preoccupation with the parasite class and the classic Murdoch versus Maxwell struggle was an example of this pissing contest for status within their class.

Their basic narrative is that capitalism is the only possible, and indeed the highest, creation of civilised economic organisation. This fact turns most of their ‘news’ content into mere political propaganda. Presumably they are aware that they are lying but it is not always as starkly simple as that; take the proposition that high taxes are bad for the economy since they deter investment and thus employment – and from a capitalist perspective this is true. But, from a working-class perspective, low taxation for the rich means an enfeebled infrastructure (schools, hospitals, etc) which impacts exclusively on their class and so renders the cuts bad for their economic and social needs – also equally true. No amount of ‘fact checking’ can resolve the reality of this class struggle as within capitalism such internal contradictions are always present. Indeed, this is the primary ‘fact’ contained in any interpretation of information – the rest is pure rhetoric.

From the time of Ancient Rome the ‘people’ are considered to be a mindless mob when they indulge in any protest against conditions. The protagonists of the ‘Farage riots’ were universally condemned as mindless thugs without any reference to their representatives in Parliament (Reform Party) or the legitimisation of such actions by none other than the former president of the USA Donald Trump who lionised the rioters at the Washington Capitol building. The rioters of the infamous ‘Gordon riots’ were similarly condemned with no reference to the toxic anti-Catholic culture which, like the anti-Muslim environment of the UK today, was created by the establishment for their own political needs.

The alleged disappointment of Nigel Farage when he discovered that the murderer in Southport was not a Muslim is an example of the instincts of the monstrous demagogues that capitalism creates. The present political system effectively locks out the people from any democratic expression of their concerns for five years so it is no surprise that such imposed political impotence will erupt into violence occasionally. Only the time-honoured right to a ‘petition of Parliament’ still exists but this cannot change anything in the absence of real democracy.

Although the ‘outrages’ of racist violence are universally condemned by agencies of the state they do provide a useful distraction from the real causes of the symptoms of capitalism. Immigration, racism, culture wars, two-tier policing and myriad other social problems conveniently divert the working class from prosecuting the class struggle.

All of these problems affect the majority who live in the real world of capitalist exploitation but not those who benefit from it. They have no concern for, or knowledge of, those living in poverty; without access to proper health care; poor education; terrible industrial relations, low wage jobs etc, etc.

The former Home Secretary under Thatcher, Willie Whitelaw, said, as he gazed out on the extensive grounds of his mansion, that the race riots of the early eighties did not belong in the England that he recognised. Most of the racist thugs who joyfully attacked hotels containing immigrants have no knowledge or understanding of that other world of luxury and decadence. They only know the daily struggle to make a living that occasionally fails completely to provide for their own and their family’s needs. Someone must be to blame for the misery and the capitalist media always have ready-made scapegoats available to distract the politically naive from the culpability of the parasites whose cause they slavishly serve.""

# Message to the Capitalists of the World

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the wealth gap has widened due to the decline of welfare, leading to heightened criticism of capitalism among young people troubled by social inequality and economic instability. Authoritarian ideologies and forces such as socialism and Nazism are gaining momentum again, particularly in the United States!

As widely known, advanced countries like Japan, Korea, and Western nations have guaranteed individual rights and freedoms through their constitutions, thereby unleashing personal creativity and achieving unprecedented prosperity in human history! The essence of modern democratic capitalism lies in the ability of voters to pursue basic rights, freedoms, suffrage, and prosperity, regardless of their beliefs, origins, status, or occupation. The miraculous effect where voters and governments multiply wealth dozens of times in just a century truly embodies the wisdom of human civilization!

Conversely, the terrible decline and tragedy faced by nations and movements rejecting democracy and capitalism are well known! The elitism, totalitarianism, and socialism advocated by communism and Nazism not only ignore the progress and lessons of human history but also regress from it! Left-wing authoritarianism, which believes that surrendering personal freedom and human rights to the state will improve society, is the epitome of archaic superstition, nonsense, and folly!

If this situation is left unchecked and America were to turn red, civil war, abolition of private property, economic collectivization, and violent class struggles would erupt, resulting in tens of millions of casualties within the United States alone!

Furthermore, if America were to turn into a new Soviet Union, revolutionary exports, a second Cold War, conflicts, and large-scale clashes on a global scale would be inevitable, potentially leading to a world war and the loss of hundreds of millions of lives worldwide! Of course, it would have severe negative impacts on the entire world, including Japan!

**It must absolutely be stopped!**

In this series, we will outline strategies for how the capitalist class can overcome this crisis and safeguard global peace and prosperity!

# To you who will surely die in fear and suffering, I tell you, capitalists of all nations, unite!

If socialists were to seize power again, as happened in the former Soviet Union, Nazi Europe, Continental China and North Korea, we and our families would be deprived of our rights, robbed of our property, and destined to suffer and die in fear and humiliation! As history shows, in authoritarian regimes like Nazism and the Soviet Union, capitalists are powerless! The power of capital is feeble before the unlimited state power!

Even if America were to turn red and the American capitalist class faced the threat of bloodshed, perhaps if the capitalist classes of Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Europe united and intervened, they could protect the lives, wealth, and families of America's capitalist class! **But we won't do that!** The reason being that the current so-called capitalist class is merely a collective term for certain individuals and corporations, who are not comrades aiding each other but rather business rivals competing against each other!

Of course, there may be individuals who would throw away their personal wealth to save American friends or relatives, but the capitalist class does not possess the class unity envisaged in communist theory!

Moreover, there is no means for them to stand up and help each other as a class! The capitalist class lacks a political community, lacks direct means to exercise sovereignty, and can only indirectly influence politics through donations and the like! While there are chambers of commerce and economic associations in various countries and regions, there are no political parties protecting the safety and property of capitalists worldwide, and no representatives of capitalists elected through elections! There are no decision-making or executive bodies!

Blaming the capitalist class for economic disparity and environmental destruction and claiming that such problems can be solved by overthrowing capitalism are gross overestimations propagated by totalitarians!

To cause or solve such global problems, there is a need for institutions that form a unified will of the capitalist class and means for collective action, requiring highly developed political structures (decision-making and executive bodies)!

***Yes, like a nation.***

# Establish a Worldwide Union of the Capitalist Class, Founding ""Capitalia""

**The capitalist class has no homeland!** Here, ""homeland of the capitalists"" refers, firstly, to a democratic decision-making body where capitalists, regardless of ideology or nationality, can register as voters, equivalent to a national parliament, and secondly, to executive bodies that execute the decisions of the highest decision-making body!

Because there is no homeland, the capitalist class cannot mobilize its power, cannot rescue capitalist brethren from the storm of revolution, and cannot minimize the number of victims and losses!

To save ourselves and save the world, we capitalists need a homeland! The collective action of capitalists from civilized countries is the primary condition for overcoming the crisis to come! The bourgeoisie (capitalist class) must first establish a parliament where capitalists are voters and organize a government dedicated to pursuing the interests of capitalists!

Then the capitalist class will be able to mobilize its full strength, protect itself, safeguard its families, prevent revolutions on the brink, eradicate poverty and wars—the perennial scourges of humanity—and even achieve world peace and enrich all humanity! **Capitalists of the world, unite!**

# Goals of Capitalia

The goal of the nation-building movement for the capitalists' homeland, Capitallia, is to globally unite the capitalist class, establish a parliament where all capitalists of the world are voters, create a constitution, organize a government, separate the judiciary, and ultimately establish a global organization called ""Capitallia,"" which functions like a nation-state for capitalists!

This chapter will explain its objectives!

**1. Protection of Human Life and Preservation of Private Property**

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, welfare systems in Western countries have deteriorated, and the gap between the rich and poor has widened!

In the United States in particular, criticism of capitalism is growing among young people, and socialist ideologies are gaining strength!

In the unlikely event that America becomes ""red,"" civil war, economic collectivization, and violent class struggle could occur, potentially resulting in millions of casualties within the United States alone!

Moreover, if a ""red"" America becomes the new Soviet Union, the export of revolution, a second Cold War, global conflicts, and large-scale confrontations would be unavoidable. In the worst case, it could lead to a world war, with the potential loss of hundreds of millions of lives worldwide, centered on America!

We, the capitalist class, have a duty to protect our lives, property, homeland, and compatriots from anti-capitalist movements like socialism! Furthermore, from a humanitarian perspective, we believe we have a duty to do our best to protect foreign countries and foreigners within our capacity!

**2. Addressing Issues Such as Poverty, Environmental Destruction, and War**

It is necessary to address global issues such as wealth disparity, environmental destruction, and wars, which are often blamed on capitalism!

Since addressing these issues is beyond the capability of individual capitalists, it is essential to organize a parliament and government for the entire capitalist class, concentrate resources, and collectively work to solve these problems. The establishment of Capitallia is absolutely necessary for this purpose!

**3. Global Peace**

Conspiracy theorists often claim that wars are the machinations of the capitalist class, but in reality, peace is essential for thriving business! The invasion of Ukraine has affected my familial business too, causing significant inconvenience! It is a matter of course that wars hinder business!

Recent conflicts and global instability can be attributed to the absence of a hegemonic state following the collapse of Pax Americana (American peace) and Pax Russiana (Russian peace).

In 2013, President Obama declared that ""America is no longer the world's policeman,"" marking the end of Pax Americana. The failure of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 revealed the weakening of the Russian military, leading to the collapse of Pax Russiana. Now, a sense of ""policelessness"" has spread throughout the international community, and conflicts are flaring up everywhere!

Therefore, the quickest solution to restore and maintain world peace is to establish a hegemonic state or coalition with unparalleled economic power!

When Capitallia is realized, we will create the strongest military, funded by our wealth, to rebuild the world's police force! We will achieve Pax Capitallica, world peace under capitalist lead! Just as socialist states name their armies the Red Army, we will respectfully name this army the **Golden Army** for its gold color! **Golden Peace**!

**4. Eradication of Poverty**

Since World War II, the world has achieved remarkable economic development under Pax Americana and U.S.-led capitalism, lifting billions out of poverty, significantly reducing global economic disparities, and substantially improving welfare levels!

While America has recently leaned toward a ""nation-first"" approach, for a long time after the war, America guaranteed the safety of maritime trade, often sacrificing its own national interests to open up vast consumer markets, invested abundant capital, and built supply chains, achieving globalization on a global scale. This was undeniably a monumental achievement in human history! The realization of post-war global economic growth was dependent on the United States!

Though America's departure is regrettable, humanity has no time to mourn! We must urgently secure a successor! If a smooth transition is successful and peace and economic growth continue, poverty could be completely eradicated within two to three decades! If the transition fails, not only will future growth be impossible, but the East Asian economy could collapse and decline!

Capitallia must inherit the position of superpower from America, continue capitalism, maintain economic growth, and accomplish the great task of eradicating poverty!

**5. Making Capitalists the Majority**

The capitalist class is often seen as controlling the world, but historically, it has often been the target of persecution, massacre, and plunder! Even in modern capitalist democracies like the United States, the 99% non-capitalists are seen as good, while the 1% capitalists are seen as evil, justifying criticism and attacks against the latter!

This is partly because the capitalist class is a minority, making it vulnerable to the tyranny of the majority!

Therefore, we aim to create a state where the capitalist class holds the majority, representing and executing the interests of the capitalist class!

**6. Eradication of the Proletariat**

We will establish a budget for eradicating the working class, create countless new companies, and distribute their shares to workers, turning them into new capitalists and incorporating them as voters of Capitallia!

By making them beneficiaries of capitalism, anti-capitalist ideologies would threaten their own property, leading to the natural decline of anti-capitalism! Ultimately, we aim to eradicate the working class by making all of humanity part of the capitalist class!

**7. Defense of Democracy**

The system known as modern democracy, or bourgeois democracy, was established by the capitalist class that grew under a capitalist economy, demanding and acquiring civil rights, including property rights!

Economic freedom is therefore a prerequisite for modern civil rights, and the two are fundamentally inseparable! For example, in the developmental dictatorships of East Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, China), capitalist economic growth led to significant expansions of civil liberties and often resulted in democratization, while in all Eastern countries where economic freedom was abolished under communist theory, democratic institutions immediately collapsed, and human rights were suspended!

Of course, economic freedom is essential for the future prosperity of democracy, and we must absolutely prevent international politics from being taken over by anti-capitalists!

**8. Defense of Capitalism**

We once dreamed a beautiful dream! A future where poverty and war disappear, and everyone is happy! If globalization ends and an era of warring states begins, that dream will be shattered forever!

We, the capitalist class, must contribute to the stability, freedom, and development of the entire international community! The establishment of Capitallia is a grand endeavor to correct the course of human history and save the world!

The world's economies are now interdependent! If the capitalist order led by America collapses, many developing countries in Asia and Africa, which have recently achieved remarkable development, could fall into economic turmoil and instability, losing their future!

If the framework of free trade and international cooperation, built under the ideals of American capitalism, collapses, poverty and inequality will increase globally, leading to the rise of totalitarianism and dictatorship!

We, the capitalist class, must work to maintain and promote the capitalist economy in the international community, ensuring the overall prosperity and stability! We have the responsibility to prevent the rise of anti-capitalist forces, spread the values of freedom and democracy, and pass them on to the next generation!

For the survival and prosperity of capitalist society, we must actively protect economic freedom and human rights both domestically and internationally, and pursue not only our own interests but also the happiness and peace of all humanity! **Capitalists of the World, Unite!**

# Message to the Capitalists of the World: Annihilate the Proletariat!

Behind the support for heretical ideologies like communism and Nazism lies the existence of non-capitalists suffering from unemployment and hardship! They have no property and despair about the future, leading them to consider foolish ideas!

Therefore, Capitalia, the homeland of the capitalists incorporates the proletariat into the capitalist class, ultimately eradicating proletarianism by making everyone capitalists and eliminating the proletariat!

**Definition of Capitalists**

A capitalist owns capital (a self-expanding entity of value), lends it, invests it to hire people, manages businesses, or broadly provides funds!

The typical capitalist is a shareholder\* who provides capital to corporations, holds supreme decision-making power\*, and receives part of the profits earned from corporate activities in the form of stock appreciation and dividends!

Conversely, the proletariat, or the working class, refers to people who do not own stocks and earn a living by selling their labor!

\*Shareholders have the right to participate in and vote at the general meetings of shareholders, which are the supreme decision-making bodies of corporations, and can pass resolutions on all matters concerning the corporation!

# Democratize Capitalism! ~ Proletariat Annihilation Plan ~

Firstly, a joint-stock company is a democratic government with shareholders as voters and the general meeting of shareholders as the supreme decision-making body! Thus, owning shares means having influence over companies and also signifies suffrage in capitalism! For the democratization of capitalism itself, everyone should become capitalists!

To achieve this, the Capitalist Parliament must approve a budget to eradicate the proletariat, establish numerous new enterprises, and distribute their shares to the proletariat! Ultimately, everyone will become capitalists!

If non-capitalists are incorporated into the capitalist class, everyone will be able to enjoy the benefits of a capitalist economy! Consequently, the socialization of private property will expose their own property to crisis, prompting them to universally oppose socialism!

Just as democracy once expanded suffrage to all citizens, Capitalia the ""Homeland of the Capitalists"" aims to make all humanity part of the capitalist class! Of course, former proletarians who thus become capitalists will gain suffrage in Capitalia and become new voters!

Furthermore, to include all people as capitalists, it is necessary to establish a ""Proletariat House (tentative)"" within the Capitalist Parliament, granting suffrage to the proletariat! The Proletariat House will aggregate the opinions of the proletariat, who are being incorporated into the capitalist class, and propose policies to support their economic growth! The establishment of the Proletariat House ensures that the proletariat is treated equally as potential members of the capitalist reserve and future comrades, fostering trust between classes and promoting economic and political growth!

# Noblesse Oblige (Noble Duty) of Capitalists

In advanced countries such as Japan, which dismantled the caste system and introduced a constitutional parliamentary system, poverty eradication rapidly advanced, and similarly, the establishment of the Capitalist Parliament and the democratization of capitalism through the incorporation of the proletariat into the capitalist class will surely bring about rapid political and economic growth among the proletariat and eliminate the economic disparity between the capitalist and proletarian classes within a few decades!

Expanding the capitalist class in this way, broadening support for capitalism, eradicating poverty and unhappiness, saving the world and humanity, and realizing the happiness of all humanity!

This is the Noble Duty (Noblesse Oblige) of ""the Modern Aristocratic Class"" - the capitalists!

Note that the above is not merely a moral obligation! It is a vital, realistic necessity driven by the imminent threat of revolution and mass death! We, the capitalist class, must unite to save the world and humanity, make everyone capitalists, eradicate poverty and unhappiness, and protect our own lives and families! **Capitalists of all nations, unite!**",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1f4s1hp/capitalia_the_homeland_of_the_capitalists/,1725014282.0,1f4s1hp
elites,CapitalismVSocialism,"List of military interventions, involvement in regime change, and support for subversion carried out by communist countries.","In response to the post of the highly decorated ""Mr living comfortably in a capitalist country but yearning for socialism,"" Holgrin, https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/s/eKJQtD9RQC
I would like to highlight the numerous interventions and wars carried out by countries led by communist figures in the 20th century.

This is going to be a long post but I think is necessary, considering how our communists friends conveniently overlook any instances where their beloved leaders engaged in warfare or interfered in the democratic processes of other nations. For this I will only use the two countries that intervened the most.


Soviet Union:

Afghan Civil War - Two Soviet invasions of Afghanistan took place between 1929 and 1930.

The first intervention was a special operation aimed at supporting the ousted king of Afghanistan, Amanullah Khan, in a civil war against the Saqqawists and Basmachi. The Soviets occupied the Balkh Province however they withdrew after the King fled the country. Thus, the Saqqawists took control in January 1929.

The second intervention took place after the Afghan Saqqawist government allowed Basmachi insurgents (an anti-Russian Islamic movement) to operate from northern Afghanistan against the Soviets. Despite the overthrow of Saqqadist government in October 1929 and restoration of the monarchy, Basmachi bases remained in northern Afghanistan with threats of declaring independence from Afghanistan. As such the new Afghan government agreed to a Soviet intervention by June 1930. The result was the Basmachi bases largely being destroyed.

Soviet invasion of Xinjiang 


In 1934, two brigades of about 7,000 Soviet GPU troops, backed by tanks, airplanes and artillery with mustard gas, crossed the border to assist Sheng Shicai in gaining control of Xinjiang. The brigades were named ""Altayiiskii"" and ""Tarbakhataiskii"". Sheng's Manchurian army was being severely beaten by an alliance of the Han Chinese army led by general Zhang Peiyuan, and the New 36th Division led by Ma Zhongying. Ma fought under the banner of the Kuomintang Republic of China government. The joint Soviet-White Russian force was called ""The Altai Volunteers"". Soviet soldiers disguised themselves in uniforms lacking markings, and were dispersed among the White Russians.

Winter War

On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War


Korean War 


Though not officially belligerent during the Korean War (1950–53), the Soviet Union played a significant, covert role in the conflict; it provided material and medical services, as well as Soviet pilots and aircraft, most notably MiG-15 fighter jets, to aid the North Korean-Chinese forces against the United Nations forces. The Soviets claimed 510 UN aircraft shot down in just the first year of the war and a total of 1,300 during the entire war while losing only 345 of their own.

Hungarian Revolution 


After Stalinist Hungarian dictator Mátyás Rákosi was replaced by Imre Nagy following Stalin's death and Polish reformist Władysław Gomułka was able to enact some reformist requests, large numbers of protesting Hungarians compiled a list of demands, including free secret-ballot elections, independent tribunals, and inquiries into Stalin and Rákosi Hungarian activities. Under the orders of Soviet defense minister Georgy Zhukov, Soviet tanks entered Budapest. Protester attacks at the Parliament forced the collapse of the Soviet-backed government.

The new government that came to power during the revolution formally disbanded the Hungarian secret police, declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. The Soviet Politburo thereafter moved to crush the revolution with a large Soviet force invading Budapest and other regions of the country. Approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary, some 26,000 Hungarians were put on trial by the new Soviet-installed János Kádár government and, of those, 13,000 were imprisoned. Imre Nagy was executed, along with Pál Maléter and Miklós Gimes, after secret trials in June 1958. By January 1957, the Hungarian government had suppressed all public opposition. These Hungarian government's violent oppressive actions alienated many Western Marxists, yet strengthened communist control in all the European communist states, cultivating the perception that communism was both irreversible and monolithic.

Invasion of Czechoslovakia 

A period of political liberalization took place in 1968 in Eastern Bloc country Czechoslovakia called the Prague Spring. The event was spurred by several events, including economic reforms that addressed an early 1960s economic downturn. In April, Czechoslovakian leader Alexander Dubček launched an ""Action Program"" of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of movement, along with an economic emphasis on consumer goods, the possibility of a multiparty government and limiting the power of the secret police. Initial reaction within the Eastern Bloc was mixed, with Hungary's János Kádár expressing support, while Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and others grew concerned about Dubček's reforms, which they feared might weaken the Eastern Bloc's position during the Cold War. On 3 August, representatives from the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia met in Bratislava and signed the Bratislava Declaration, which declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and declared an implacable struggle against ""bourgeois"" ideology and all ""anti-socialist"" forces. 

On the night of 20–21 August 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from four Warsaw Pact countries – the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary – invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion comported with the Brezhnev Doctrine, a policy of compelling Eastern Bloc states to subordinate national interests to those of the Bloc as a whole and the exercise of a Soviet right to intervene if an Eastern Bloc country appeared to shift towards capitalism. The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000. In April 1969, Dubček was replaced as first secretary by Gustáv Husák, and a period of ""normalization"" began. Husák reversed Dubček's reforms, purged the party of liberal members, dismissed opponents from public office, reinstated the power of the police authorities, sought to re-centralize the economy and re-instated the disallowance of political commentary in mainstream media and by persons not considered to have ""full political trust"".

Vietnam War


Some 3,300 Soviet military experts, among them spetsnaz, were sent to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. 

Their mission was twofold. One, help a communist nation defeat an American ally and two, test and evaluate their most sophisticated radars and missiles directly against the best American aircraft had to offer. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War 


Soviet ""military advisors"" played an important role in at least four wars:

The Angolan Civil War (1975–92), where the USSR supported the left-wing MPLA;

The Mozambican Civil War (1977–92), where Moscow also sided with the socialist government;

The Ogaden War between Ethiopia and Somalia (1977–78).

War of Attrition between Arab countries and Israel.

Congo Crisis, where USSR backed the Republic of the Congo against the State of Katanga.

Operation Trikora: The Indonesian operation to seize Netherlands New Guinea was backed by Soviet troops manning submarines.

North Yemen Civil War, Soviets supported Nasser's intervention in Yemen.

Yemenite War of 1972, the Soviet Union opposed the Yemen Arab Republic and supported South Yemen.

Yemenite War of 1979, the USSR supported South Yemen's invasion of the Yemen Arab Republic.


Invasion of Afghanistan (1979–89)


The Soviet–Afghan War was a protracted armed conflict fought in the Soviet-controlled Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA) from 1979 to 1989. The war was a major conflict of the Cold War.

The conflict led to the deaths of between 562,000 and 2,000,000 Afghans, while millions more fled from the country as refugees; most externally displaced Afghans sought refuge in Pakistan and in Iran. Approximately 6.5% to 11.5% of Afghanistan's erstwhile population of 13.5 million people (per the 1979 census) is estimated to have been killed over the course of the conflict. The Soviet–Afghan War caused grave destruction throughout Afghanistan and has also been cited by scholars as a significant factor that contributed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, formally ending the Cold War.

Soviet involvement in regime change. 


The Soviet Union and Russia engaged in foreign electoral interfervention in the national elections of many countries. One study indicated that the Soviet Union and Russia engaged in 36 interventions in foreign elections from 1946 to 2000.

Foreing interventions by Cuba:



Throughout it's history the Cuban communist goverment has been actively involved in aiding, training and arming leftist movements, primarily in Latin America and Africa. In the 1960’s Castro and his brother, Raul, believed that the political and economic conditions that produced their revolution existed in Latin America and that anti-American revolutions would occur throughout the continent. Cuban agents and diplomats established contact with revolutionary and guerrilla groups in the area and began distributing propaganda, weapons, and aid. Many Latin Americans were brought to Cuba for training and then returned to their countries. Cuba gave support to guerrilla groups in 14 countries out of the total of 19 in Latin America. 

Major emphasis was placed on instructing several hundred pro-Castro Latin Americans in violence and guerrilla warfare. Dominicans, Guatemalans, Venezuelans, and Chileans were trained in special camps in Cuba and infiltrated back to their countries. African leaders from Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, South Africa, Spanish Guinea, Tanganyika, and Zanzibar arrived in Cuba for military training.


In 1959, Castro aided armed expeditions against Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. During the early and mid-1960s, Guatemala, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Bolivia all faced serious Cuban-baked attempts to develop guerrilla focos. In seeking indigenous groups with which to cooperate, the Cubans rejected orthodox Latin American Communist parties, which they regarded as ineffectual. Instead, they lent their support to more militant groups dedicated to armed violence even when their Marxism was not fully articulated.


In the mid-1970s, Cuba renewed its penchant for direct intervention, not in Latin America but in Africa.

In Angola, 20,000 Cuban troops, supported by Soviet logistics and materiel, assured the supremacy of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, which had the strongest ties to Moscow of the three movements competing for power after Portugal’s withdraw.

In Ethiopia, the integration of Soviet and Cuban operations was even more complete, with the Soviets providing overall command and control, materiel, and transportation for 13-15,000 Cuban troops fighting against Somali forces.


Even when pursuing an open policy in the 1970s of establishing normal diplomatic relations with a number of Latin American countries, Cuba retained its clandestine ties with remnants of the insurgents and other pro-Cuban elements in Latin America, providing asylum, propaganda, some training, and other support. Between 1970 and 1973, Cuba’s security services moved arms and agents into Chile. At the same time, Cubans helped organize President Allende’s personal security and trained many leaders of the Chilean Movement of the Revolutionary Left.

Military Training. In the 80s witnesses and former trainees described several camps in Cuba dedicated specifically to military training, including one in Pinar del Rio Province and another near Guanabo, east of Havana. The camps accommodated several hundred trainees. Groups from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Colombia, Grenada, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, Chile, and Uruguay were trained in the facilities during 1979 and 1980 alone.

Recruits were normally provided false documentation (sometimes Cuban passports) by Cuban agents in third countries and were flown to Cuba on civil aircraft under cover as “students” or other occupations. Training normally last 3-6 months and consisted of instruction by Cuban cadres in sabotage, explosives, military tactics, and weapon use. Although military training was frequently tied closely to operational requirements – the M-19 guerrillas who landed in Colombia in early 1981 did so immediately upon completion of their military instruction in Cuba – witnesses report that political indoctrination is also included in the curriculum.


Central America: 
 
Nicaragua - In July 1979, internal and external factors converged to bring about the triumph of the anti-Somoza insurrection and the subsequent domination of the new Nicaraguan Government by the Cuban-trained leadership of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). These events provided a key test for Cuba’s new mechanism and strategy for promoting armed pro-Cuban movements in the hemisphere.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_assistance_to_the_Sandinista_National_Liberation_Front



El Salvador. Before 1979, Cuban support to Salvadoran radicals involved training small numbers of guerrillas, providing modest financial aid, and serving as a political conduit between Salvadoran extremists and Communists outside the hemisphere. During the Nicaraguan civil war, Cuba concentrated on support for the FSLN. After the fall of Somoza, Cuba began intense efforts to help pro-Cuban guerrillas come to power in El Salvador. When a reform-minded, civil-military government was established in October 1979, Cuba’s first priority was to tighten the political organization and unity of El Salvador’s fragments violent left. At first, arms shipments and other aid from Cuba were kept low as the Cubans insisted on a unified strategy as the price of increased material support.


Cuba provided few weapons and ammunition to Salvadoran guerrillas from its own resources but played a key role in coordinating the acquisition and delivery of arms from Vietnam, Ethiopia, and Eastern Europe through Nicaragua. Cuban training of Salvadoran guerrillas increased sharply in 1980 as Cuba concentrated on building a trained army able to mount major offensives. A typical 3-month training program included guerrilla tactics.

https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/28/world/cuba-directs-salvador-insurgency-former-guerrilla-lieutenant-says.html





Guatemala: In 1980 Cuba agreed to increased military training and assistance to Guatemala guerrillas. A large number of the 2,000 or more guerrillas trained in Cuba. 


Costa Rica - Cuba took advantage of Costa Rica’s strong popular and governmental opposition to Somoza’s authoritarian government and of Costa Rica’s open democratic system to establish and coordinate a covert support network for guerrilla operations elsewhere in Central America. 



Honduras - Cuba provided para-military training to a small number of Hondurans in the early 1960s, but relations with Honduran radicals were strained until the late 1970s. Cuba then resumed military training for members of the Honduran Communist Party (PCH) and integrated them into the “internationalist brigade” fighting in the Nicaraguan civil war. After the war, PCH members returned to Cuba for additional training.



The Caribbean:
 
Jamaica.  -  the late 1970s, Jamaica became a special target for Cuba. Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials developed close relations with important members of the People’s National Party, which governed Jamaica from 1973 until 1980. Cuban security personnel trained Jamaican security officers in Cuba and Jamaica, including members of the security force of the office of the Prime Minister. Cuba also trained about 1,400 Jamaican youths in Cuba as construction workers through a “brigadista” program. Political indoctrination in Cuba formed part of this group’s curriculum. A considerable number of these Jamaican youths received military training while in Cuba, including instruction in revolutionary tactics and use of arms.



Guyana - In 1978, as many as 200 Cuban technicians, advisers, and medical personnel were stationed in Guyana. However, while claiming fraternal relations with Guyana’s Government, Cuba maintained contact with radical opposition groups. Guyanese authorities suspected the Cubans of involvement in a crippling sugar strike. In August 1978, five Cuban diplomats were expelled for involvement in illegal activities.

Cuban military advisers provided guerrilla training outside Guyana to members of a small radical Guyanese opposition group, the Working People’s Alliance. Five of the seven members of the Cuban Embassy were known or suspected intelligence agents.


Grenada. Cuban influence in Grenada mushroomed almost immediately after the March 1979 coup led by the New Jewel Movement of Maurice Bishop. Bishop and his closest colleagues were Western-educated Marxist radicals, and they turned for help to Fidel Castro, who proved willing to provide assistance.




Dominican Republic - Since early 1980, the Cubans were encouraging radicals in the Dominican Republic to unite and prepare for armed actions. Cuban intelligence officials, like Omar Cordoba Rivas, chief of the Dominican Republic desk of the America Department, made periodic visits to the island.

The Soviet Union, Cuba, and other Communist countries mounted extensive training programs for Dominican students. In July 1981, the Moscow-line Dominican Communist Party (PCD) for the first time publicized the Soviet scholarship program. Some 700 Dominican students were studying at Soviet universities, principally Patrice Lumumba university, with 75 other in five other Communist states (Bulgaria, Cuba, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Romania). 



South America:

 
Colombia - Since the 1960s, Cuba has nurtured contacts with violent extremist groups in democratic Colombia. During the 1970s, Cuba established full diplomatic relations with Colombia; Cuban involvement with Colombian revolutionaries was fairly limited, although Cuban provided some training to guerrilla leadership. Many leaders of the April 19 Movement (M-19), including the founder, Jamie Bateman – who also attended a Communist cadre school in Moscow – were trained in Cuba. Leaders of the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the Moscow-oriented Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) also received Cuban instruction.

Cuban assistance to Colombian guerrillas was stepped up after the February 1980 seizure of the Dominican Republic Embassy in Bogota. A number of diplomats, including the U.S. Ambassador, were taken hostage by M-19 terrorists. As part of a negotiated settlement, the terrorist were flown on April 17, 1980 to Cuba, where the remaining hostages were released and the terrorists were given asylum.

During mid-1980, Cuban intelligence officers arranged a meeting of Colombian extremists, attended by representatives from the M-19, FARC, ELN, and other Colombian radical groups, to discuss a common strategy and tactics. The M-19 had previously held talks with the Nicaraguan FSLN on ways to achieve unity of action among guerrilla groups in Latin America. Although the meeting did not result in agreement by Colombian guerrillas on a unified strategy, practical cooperation among the guerrilla organizations increased.


Colombia suspended relations with Cuba on March 1981, in view of the clear evidence of Cuba’s role in training M-19 guerrillas. President Turbay commented in an August 13 New York Times interview: “…When we found that Cuba, a country with which we had diplomatic relations, was using those diplomatic relations to prepare a group of guerrillas to come and fight against the government, it was a kind of Pearl Harbor of us. It was like sending ministers to Washington at the same time you are about to bomb ships in Hawaii.”


https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/13/world/colombians-combat-cuban-interference.html 



Chile - After Allende’s fall in 1973, Castro promised Chilean radicals “all the aid in Cuba’s power to provide.” Although Cuban officials maintained regular contact with many Chilean exiles, divisions among the exiles inhibited major operations. The Moscow-line Chilean Communist Party (PCCH), holding the position that revolutionary change could be accomplished by non-violent means, was critical of “left-wing forces” like the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) with which Cuba had close relations.

Throughout the 1970s, members of the MIR received training in Cuba and in some cases instructed other Latin American revolutionaries. This training ranged from political indoctrination and instruction in small arms use to sophisticated courses in document fabrication, explosives, code writing, photography, and disguise. In addition, Cuban instruction trained MIR activists in the Mideast and Africa.



Argentina - The Cubans had a long history of association with, encouragement of, and active backing for terrorism in Argentina. The Cubans were linked to the two groups responsible for unleashing the wave of leftist terrorism that swept Argentina in the early and mid-1970s, the Montoneros and the People’s Revolutionary Army (ERP). Cuba backed these organizations with advice on tactics and instructions on recruiting operations and with training in Cuba in urban and rural guerrilla techniques. During the height of Argentine terrorism, the Cubans used their embassy in Buenos Aires to maintain direct liaison with Argentine terrorists.

The Argentine terrorists were virtually defeated by 1978. In that year, Castro permitted the Montonero national leadership to relocate its headquarters to Cuba. The Montonero top command, its labor organization, and its intelligence organization, among other units, were all located in Cuba. The Cuban facilitated the travel and communications of Montoneros, supplying them with false documentation and access to Cuban diplomatic pouches. Montoneros were among the Latin American guerrillas trained in guerrilla warfare over the in the Mideast as part of a cooperative effort between Palestinian groups and Cuba.



Uruguay. After the failure of the urban insurgent organized in the early 1970s by the National Liberation Movement (MLN-Tupamaros), several hundred Tupamaros went to Cuba. During the mid-1970s, Cuba provided some of them with training in military and terrorist tactics, weapons, and intelligence. Several of these former Tupamaros subsequently assisted Cuba in running intelligence operations in Europe and Latin America. Some participated in the Cuban-organized “internationalist brigade” that fought in the Nicaraguan civil war.

Cuba continued to provide propaganda support for the Tupamaros and the Uruguayan Communist Party. Radio Havana reported on June 30, 1981 that the leader of the Communist Party of Uruguay attended a ceremony “in solidarity with the Uruguayan people’s struggle” at the headquarters of the Cuban State Committee for Material and Technical Supply in Havana. Pro-Cuban Uruguayan leaders were given red carpet treatment when they visited Havana and were usually received by at least a member of the Cuban Poliburo.

Venezuela -  Castro long sought revolution in Venezuela as well as preferential access to Venezuelan oil. Castro’s first trip after coming to power in 1959 was to Venezuela, where he solicited $300 million in oil from then newly elected President Rómulo Betancourt.  Betancourt declined and tensions between Havana and Caracas grew. In late 1961, Betancourt broke relations with Cuba altogether following a new doctrine of severing ties with governments that had come to power via non-electoral means; in 1962 Venezuela voted to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States (OAS). 

For its part, Cuba provided more than $1 million in financial support, including arms and military equipment, to Venezuelan insurgent movements such as the Armed Forces of National Liberation (Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional) between 1961 and 1964. Tensions came to a head in 1967, when the Venezuelan Army and National Guard were forced to repel an attack by a small contingent of Cuban and Venezuelan guerillas on the beach of Machurucuto. Carlos Andrés Pérez reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1974 at the beginning of his first term in office.


After the collapse of the Soviet Union and throughout the Special Period (Período Especial) of the 1990s, Cuba sought to replace the economic subsidies long provided by Moscow. Havana wanted access to oil at below market prices and investment flows from Caracas. For its part, the Chávez government pursued global leadership through alliances with other developing countries. Later, leaders in Caracas desired the political advisory and intelligence and counterintelligence support that Cuba could provide. Opportunities for Cuban participation in Venezuela’s armed forces increased as Chávez began politicizing the Venezuelan military shortly after taking office. 


In the aftermath of the 2002 coup attempt, Chávez became more radicalized and distrustful of those around him—especially, and understandably, the political opposition and oppo-sition-aligned PDVSA and military leadership. He also grew closer to Castro and the Cuban government. 


Collaboration between Cuba’s Revolutionary Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, FAR) and Venezuela’s FANBs intensified throughout the 2000s. The two countries signed bilateral agreements for the joint development and training of members of all branches of the FANB, including travel to Cuba to train, and Cuban officers began to play a direct role in planning within the Venezuelan military. A special report by Reuters published in August 2019 indicated that two agreements signed by Cuba and Venezuela in May 2008 provided for Cuban assistance in overhauling Venezuela’s Directorate of Military Intelligence, the training of Venezuelan intelligence officers in Cuba, and the provision of Cuban advisors to train and inspect Venezuelan military units. 

The Cuba-Venezuela relationship today appears largely centered on the security and intelligence transactional aspect. Increasingly, the Cuban government has supplied Caracas with security and intelligence support that help it to stay in power, such as deploying security personnel to protect Maduro and other members of the political elite, providing counterpart intelligence support to mitigate uprisings, and technical advisory to counter opposition and international efforts at regime change

In return for this security and intelligence aid, Maduro continues to grant generous, albeit declining, oil subsidies to Cuba.

Cuba continues to recruit students and professors in American universities as spies, urging them to obtain government positions, steal, and resell state secrets to US enemies. In addition to behaving as an information broker, they subvert democratic institutions in Latin America through cultural populism, polarizing societies, bringing authoritarian left-wing governments to power, and destabilizing relations with the United States.  

The creation of the São Paulo Forum in 1990 by Fidel Castro, together with a young Lula Da Silva, attracted radical left-wing parties, aspirants, and leaders, taught them how to subvert their population, create social polarization, and rise to power. Still today, the Cuban regime has regained a lifeline of influence and economic aid from sympathizing governments. At the same time, they have continuously pushed the failed agenda of “Socialism of the 21st Century,” a Marxist revisionist ideology that intends to solve structural issues in Latin America like poverty, inequality, and gender issues, but finalized in the crackdown of democratic institutions all over Latin America and compromised US relationships with governments and interests in the hemisphere.


Cuba’s communist-led intelligence services are aggressively recruiting leftist American academics and university professors as spies and influence agents, according to an internal FBI report.



Cuban intelligence services “have perfected the work of placing agents, that includes aggressively targeting U.S. universities under the assumption that a percentage of students will eventually move on to positions within the U.S. government that can provide access to information of use to the [Cuban intelligence service],” the five-page unclassified FBI report says. It notes that the Cubans “devote a significant amount of resources to targeting and exploiting U.S. academia.”



Cuban intelligence has recruited numerous spies in the past that became long-term penetration agents inside the U.S. government. According to the CI Centre, a think tank, there have been 25 Cuban spies uncovered in the United States since the 1960s, including former CIA officer Philip Agee to who defected and worked closely with both Cuban intelligence and the Soviet KGB starting in 1973.

One of the most notorious Cuban spy cases involved Ana Montes, a senior analyst who worked in the highest levels of the U.S. intelligence and policymaking communities. Montes, a former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, pleaded guilty in 2002 to spying for Cuba for 17 years.  

Montes was recruited by Cuban intelligence in 1984 while a student at the Johns Hopkins’ School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), where she was a graduate student and had voiced her hatred of the then-Reagan administration policy of backing anti-communist rebels fighting the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. She was recruited at SAIS by another Cuban spy, Marta Rita Velazquez, who worked for U.S. Agency for International Development and fled the country after Montes was arrested in 2001.

Two other notable Cuban spies were Walter Kendall Myers, a State Department Foreign Service contractor who worked for Cuban intelligence from 1979 to 2007, and his wife Gwen Myers. They were recruited after visiting Cuba. Walter Myers was a leftist who criticized “American imperialism” in a diary entry after visiting Cuba. He held a top-secret security clearance and in 2010 was sentenced to life in prison after a conviction for spying.

elites,CapitalismVSocialism,The difference between capitalism and socialism,"As a new contributor to Reddit, the main problem I see within the sphere of political debate here is the confusion of exactly what capitalism and socialism actually is. 

 This is obviously a very complex subject, multi-layered, nuanced and debated with palpable emotion, but surely it is high time that we all got on the same page with, at minimum, accurate definitions?

 Whilst I understand that some people have vested interests in ‘fighting their corner’ it is of no use to anti-capitalists as a whole if erroneous factoids are reflexively trotted out time after time merely to win an argument! The other day, for instance, someone vehemently informed me that I had no idea what I was talking about, and that Marx had stated unequivocally that there was a clear distinction between socialism and communism! Knowing that Marx would have written extensively about this if he had indeed believed it, I asked for the titles of these books that Marx must have written about the subject, as I would love to read them! The eventual reply was ‘Oh, I just checked, and it was Lenin who stated that’ 

 As socialists, we need to do better. If we are to promote socialism, a task vital to the survival of this planet, we need to understand our position better. There are people who are being paid by capitalist political foundations to infiltrate every single place where socialists gather in order to promote confusion, discord and misinformation. Reddit is not immune. 

{sound of can of worms being opened}


  Some basic definitions:
Capitalism- The system whereby the owners of the means of production exploit the workers by paying them less than the value of the goods and services these workers produce, and pocketing the difference, using this accumulating monetary wealth to repeat the cycle ad infinitum. The owning class uses the power of the State to regulate the system on their behalf. Capitalist society is conveniently divided up into ‘sovereign Nation States’ to prevent unauthorised global population movements, and to make it easier for national elites to control ‘their’ populations. Money, however, is not similarly constrained.


 The global capitalist ECONOMIC system can and does exist upon quite a wide and varied POLITICAL spectrum. This has varied over time and location from the British colonial system of genocidal enslavement for instance where they forced the Chinese to buy all their goods in silver bullion from Britain yet were made to accept heroin as payment for goods Britain ‘bought’ from the Chinese. 

Nice! 

Other kinder, gentler variants still exist of course, with all nations on Earth adapting various strains to their own liking. The so-called Nordic method of high taxation but all-encompassing social services; the (mainly) state controlled system in the old USSR et al, present day Cuba and China, or the ‘sink-or-swim’ method of the good ol’ USA.  

These are ALL however variants of capitalism, from State controlled to so-called free enterprise. They are capitalist BECAUSE a). they use money as the means to distribute (apportion) goods and services; b). There is a State infrastructure to organise it, and c). There is a ruling elite.


Socialism/Communism, conversely is an as yet untried future system that will distribute the mutually owned goods and services based upon the premise of ‘from each his abilities, to each his or indeed her needs.’ 

State boundaries will no longer exist and ruling elites also. 

Although I am not a member of any particular socialist organisation, I align with the teachings of Marx and Engels and the World Socialist Movement (WSM) 
 I am hoping for honest open and non-partizan debate regarding this rather lengthy, but I believe, important post.

elites,CapitalismVSocialism,Johan Norberg Surprisingly Endorsed Land Reform as a Prerequisite for Prosperity,"Johan Norberg is perhaps the classical liberal historian most famous for rebutting the fallacious claims about the supposed socialism of the Scandinavian countries around 2015 when such rumors were being spread by Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign and before that, as the economist who best broke down why Naomi Klein’s The Shock Doctrine was a very flawed book, built much more on ideology than sound history or political economy. It was, however, with his 2001 book In Defense of Global Capitalism, that he really cut his teeth and it is because of that book that he seems to be much more qualified than most Reason or Cato Institute scholars to talk about issues in a way that can only be described as less ideological. The example of this? The issue of land reform and how it could have stopped economic populist madmen, like Juan Peron in Argentina or Getulio Vargas in Brazil, from rising to power. This must have been especially brazen given the climate that this was happening right before the book was published. In 2000, the Marxist-inspired Robert Mugabe had just started seizing farms without expropriation and was beginning what would be a very long and painful downfall of Zimbabwe, and in particular, their former role as the breadbasket of southern Africa. So how could one defend land reform when such events were transpiring and why was Latin America in the 20th century in need of it in order to develop a successful economic base that wouldn’t fall prey to strongmen savior-type politicians? Well, the answer there is the same as in all other former colonial countries: the state-backed parceling out of land that happened under the old colonial powers was an injustice that could be corrected on libertarian grounds, as well as the need to have a nation predominantly of individual capitalist farmers, rather than tenants living in a bizarre mix of capitalism and feudalism, in order to have a culture of prosperity and stability.

  
So, what of this first claim? Surely, not all of the Americas were individually dished out to cronies by former colonial rulers and their descendants were just able to live the easy life as rent-collectors, while everyone else was in perpetual bondage as serfs, right? Well, that was thankfully not the case in places like the United States, Canada, and Australia, but when it came to Latin America, that unfortunately was much of what happened. Argentina would probably be the country most famous for this. They are said to have been totally at the mercy of a landed oligarchy and it was only by Juan Peron’s coming to power that they were brought to heel. This vastly oversimplifies the Argentine land question and even the fact that many immigrants obtained land, but in his 1980 book, The Epic of Latin America, biographer John A. Crow relates the anecdote of a member of the Argentine Congress saying that less than 2,000 people owned more land in the country than what existed in all of Italy, Belgium, Holland, and Denmark combined. Whatever truth this statistic holds is beyond the point. Argentina may be a huge country, but this land concentration created economic problems of its own, as land became a form of status and living off of rents was seen by the elite to be superior to industry and commerce. Unsurprisingly, it was thus mostly only the immigrant communities in pre-Peronist Buenos Aires who got the country’s non-agricultural sector off the ground. Almost everything else was British foreign investment. The average Joe tenant farmer in the Pampas was not going to be granted title to the land that he worked and thus his Argentina was not going to be able to be a nation of capitalist agriculturalists, like New Zealand, Canada, or Norberg’s own Sweden have been and still are to one extent or another, but rather a backwards rentier economy more akin to a banana republic for cattle and wheat that exists due to the force of a former colonial government, rather than any Lockean homesteading. This problem could then be extrapolated to pretty much all of Latin America and one of the regions’ big problem with economic development comes to the fore. It is with this background that Norberg risks perpetual reminders of the existence of Zimbabwe and accusations of not being a real libertarian, where he proposes the unthinkable: that the formerly feudal land grants be broken up and the farmers on this land gain titleship.

  
Fittingly grounding himself in classical liberal theory, he uses the examples of Latin American countries not just to promote land reform, but at the same time, to denounce the Marxist-inspired dependency theory that did take hold in the country. After writing: that “Land reforms to put an end to centuries of feudalism would have been needed, coupled with a commitment to education and free markets”, he points out how instead of seeing land concentration as the problem, academics responded to the decreased trade from the Great Depression by embracing import-substitution industrialization and turning their backs on trade. All of this greatly contributed to Latin America’s economic backwardness. Putting Latin America aside, it is interesting that a classical liberal could in this day and age call for land reform. Ever since Murray Rothbard rejected the land value tax, it has seemed to be unspeakable to point out the pre-capitalist conditions for much of land ownership in the world today. The current land distribution is seldom considered a problem, regardless of how feudal its roots go. Norberg did not go this far, but it seems taxing away the annual rental value of land is the most realistic and peaceful way to create a nation of farmer entrepreneurs in a formally feudal country. That is, after all, close to how the birthplace of Norberg’s icon, Anders Chyndenius, started down the track to being the modern capitalist nation of Finland that they are today. In order to stop Soviet-influence in the country, feudal tenancy was largely put to an end by the 1930s and the Finns who had once embraced the Bolsheviks were ready to beat back the Red Army in the Winter War. Perhaps with a similar reform in Argentina, the tyranny of Juan Peron and his toxic Kirchnerist legacy would not haunt the country to this day.

elites,CapitalismVSocialism,What would happen if we put the Cuban government in charge of the US and the US government in control of Cuba?,"


This is an interesting question giving that Cuba and the United States stand as the epitomes of socialism and capitalism, respectively, in the Western Hemisphere.


I lived in Cuba for more than 20 years and I feel I can give an insight of what life would be in the USA if the cuban regime was in charge.




Under such circumstances the US will be an authoritarian state. The constitution will codifie the USA as a one-party system in which the Communist Party is the only legal political party. 

A socialist economic system is imposed where all means of production belong to the state. The media is tightly controlled, and demonstrations against the revolution are illegal. The president bans books, movies, and music that do not align with his ideology, and even restricts your freedom to travel, own a car, or communicate with the outside world. You are forced to rely on ration cards for basic necessities. The country becomes a police state, where people are encouraged to spy on each other and anyone suspected of opposing the regime is sent to prison. 

Citizens would face severe restrictions on their civil and economic liberties, including the loss of private property, closed private schools, and no freedom of expression or assembly. Those who resist such changes would be labeled enemies of the state and subjected to imprisonment and persecution. The quality of life is poor for most citizens but the leader and his cronies live in luxury.  

The new commander in chief would be omnipresent, replacing advertisements for entertainment and brands with images of himself on every street and every school. The constitution will ban commercial advertising on billboards and the use of media to promote capitalism. 

Almost every profitable sector of the economy is reserved for the state: manufacturing, mining, construction, tourism, energy, tobacco and sugar production, financial and insurance activities, real estate, engineering, education, journalism, entertainment and sports, among others. 

Leaving the state as the only employer, your salary will be among the lowest in the world. State employees who express political dissent or disagreement with the authorities face harassment or summary dismissal. Workers do not have the right to strike or bargain collectively, and independent labor unions are illegal.   


Academic freedom is restricted. Private schools are banned, teaching materials often contain ideological content, and educators commonly require PCC affiliation for career advancement. Education will be free on all levels but form an early age you will be indoctrinated with communist principles. Every morning before the class starts children will have to chant ""pioneers for communism we will be like Che"". If there is suspicion that you or your parents hold anti-government beliefs, you will be denied the opportunity to attend university. You will also have to participate in the many parades commemorating the revolution specially the 1st of may, not going may have consequences in your career. 

 
The authoritarian one-party system will exclude the public from any genuine, autonomous political participation. Intelligence agencies will play an important role in suppressing dissent and wield deep influence over virtually every aspect of the state. Members of dissident groups and even independent actors, journalists, and other fields are systematically surveilled and periodically interrogated in order to silence them or turn them into informants.



The state has full control over all media outlets, limiting citizens to three television news channels. All private media is illegal, and even the internet, operated solely by the state-owned telephone company, is subject to strict censorship. The government frequently blocks websites that openly criticize them, and in times of potential unrest, they cut off internet access to prevent the spread of dissent.



No separation of powers or rule of law exists in the country. The government controls the judicial system. The Constitution explicitly states that the courts are “subordinate in the line of authority to the National Assembly… and the Council of State,” a supreme executive branch body, and that the Council of State may issue the courts instructions. This structure robs the courts of even the semblance of independence and impartiality.  


Demostrantions agasint the goverment are illegal. No freedom of the press is allowed, all newspaper are onwed by the state and they are filled with socliast propaganda. The country’s independent press operates outside the law, its publications are considered “enemy propaganda,” and its journalists are routinely harassed, detained, interrogated, threatened, defamed in the official press, and prohibited from traveling abroad. The government maintains a firm stance against independent journalism, relying not only on mass organizations but also on its security forces and courts to threaten, intimidate, detain, and prosecute journalists who do not espouse the government’s views. It also persists in prosecutions, short-term detentions, surveillance, phone interruption, and other intimidations of human rights activists.


Restrictions on freedom of assembly are a key form of political control. Security forces and government-backed assailants routinely break up peaceful gatherings or protests by political dissidents and civic activists. Authorities treat as criminal offenses nonviolent activities such as meeting to discuss the economy or elections, writing letters to the government, reporting on political or economic developments, speaking to international reporters, or advocating the release of political prisoners. 


The new economic policies wont allow Americans to freely open and operate businesses. The opportunity is only available to those who are in close proximity to the ruling government. Furthermore, all private property is seized and foreign companies are taken over by the state. 


The wealthy and middle-income groups will face persecution and be characterized as indolent elites who stand in the way of the progress of the hardworking underprivileged masses. 


In summary, you are living in a despotic regime where your fundamental rights, such as voting, protesting, establishing a business, and owning private property, are nonexistent. The dearth of basic necessities is a daily reality, and the standard of living is dismally low. The mere thought of speaking out against your goverment is daunting, as surveillance from both the police and your own neighbors is omnipresent. The government monitors all forms of communication, including a subpar internet connection. The country is not only economically closed-off, but also culturally and socially isolated.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/13glqrz/what_would_happen_if_we_put_the_cuban_government/,1683994739.0,13glqrz
elites,CapitalismVSocialism,What people dont understand about the US embargo on Cuba.,"
There's a lot of missinformation about Cuba and the embargo on the Internet. Everytime someone brings the subject of poverty in Cuba people are quick to name the embargo as the cause of all the problems in the island. Without taking into account what the embargo does or what the regime policies have been for over 60 years. Is an excused use by those eager to hide the regime's inefficiency and to avoid any commitment to human rights. 





The embargo mostly exists to restrict easy access to American markets by the cuban military. Cuba as a country is entirely operated by the military, especially the economic sector. 





The embargo doesn’t prevent other countries from trading with Cuba. 


Cuba has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1995 and has formal relations with 160 countries. 

Cuba mainly imports food, cereals, fuel, diesel engines, vehicles, motor parts and vegetable oils. Cuba’s main imports partners are Venezuela, China, Spain, Brazil, the United States, Mexico, Canada, Italy, Germany, Vietnam and Russia. 
Imports in Cuba increased to 8.431 USD Million in 2021 from 7.230 USD Million in 2020

The European Union remains Cuba’s main export and trade partner. It is also the largest foreign investor in the country (mainly in the tourism, construction, light industry and agro-industry sectors) and accounts for one third of the tourists arriving on the island.

Since 1988, the European Union has funded with around EUR 300 million more than 200 cooperation projects in the country. Some 80 projects worth EUR 155 million are currently ongoing, reflecting an increase of three times the average level of the last decade.

European Union Exports to Cuba were of US$1.56 Billion during 2021. 
 


The US is Cuba's largest food import partner, and from the US they import more chicken than all other countries combined. Chicken is also the #1 most imported product in Cuba.

The only food-related restriction from the US embargo on Cuba is a prohibition on granting any credit for food transactions. Therefore US companies are legally welcome to sell chicken to Cuba, but by law it must be paid in cash before it leaves the United States to Cuba. In 2021 the US exported $323M to Cuba.  




Moreover the embargo does not prevent other countries from investing in the island is Cuba's own laws and restrictions that makes it a tough emvioremt for investors. 




The “Cuban Embargo"" is not a single “revocable” Law - Its an ever expanding list of Cuban officials and Cuban state enterprises. The list is constantly updated as Cuban regime makes more shell companies. 

Because the “Embargo” is targeting specific Cuban individuals and companies, lifting it only helps those individuals and enterprises burry themselves deeper in power. Those same individuals and enterprises are known to sell humanitarian aid at a markup. Those same individuals live in abundance and luxury while their people strugle to eat. 


Now, imagine how much longer the Regime can continue to repress with unlimited funds from reselling newly imported goods. The embargo prevents this. 


To their own people and internationally the Cuban regime desperately wants you to think the “blockade” is all encompassing, nothing gets through. But this is just cheap propaganda. They’re pocketing about $300M / year in aid, from the US.  Resale of aid, (sometimes with different labels) + Tourism from Canada and Europe. 


Anyone saying that removing the “Embargo” is good for the people, is unaware of the reality, Is Pro- Cuban government or a victim of propaganda. 


The embargo isn't the one limiting access to goods and supplies, it's the government that continuously asphyxiates any attempts at making a living by one's own account. 




The truth is, even if the embargo went away, there are so many restrictions and laws against the kinds of behaviors that allow an economy to flourish that nothing would change. What would change, however, is the massive influx of American tourists that would stay at military-operated hotels and fill up the cash reserves of the government, who uses that money to repress people and maintain the current system.  



The particularity of the Cuban economic policy is that it doesn’t allow Cubans (from inside the island) to open businesses and operate freely, probably because they fear the rise of a Cuban elite that is not subjected to the party/government and challenge their monopoly on the island resources (both natural and human). The Cuban government is okay with the capitalist way as long as it is not done by Cubans within the island. The current state is a big corporate monopoly (disguised as a political entity) with an army that wants to maintain total control over a specific territory and its people in order to preserve itself. 




Nearly $6 billion flow from Miami to Cuba every year in the form of cash, gifts, remittances, etc...and there's a lot of people in Miami that favour the embargo while simultaneously being the ones who put money in the government's pockets.  


The military companies control 100% of remittance transactions arriving through official channels, the Cuban Government refused to hand over their handling to any civil institution.   

The military holding companies control a significant share of the Cuban economy, spanning from hotels, car rental companies, and gas stations, to almost all retail chains on the island. As a result, for every $1 of remittances sent via Western Union and later spent in goverment shops, the military gains 74 cents. 


Cubans are only given the equivalent of what is sent to them in a devalued currency, worthless anywhere else in the world. The electronic dollar that the Government deposits in MLC accounts is what Cubans use to buy basic necessities at stores that also belong to the military, with a markup of at least 240% with respect to the value at which the goverment buys abroad.


The remittences that you send monthly to your loved ones never reaches their hands, but remains stranded in a bank account in a third country to be used later, either to launder capital and convert it into assets, building new hotels on nationalized lands stolen in 1959, or to multiply it when they buy the chicken that they later sell in the dollar stores they own, at a price seven times their acquisition cost.




Other examples:  

\- When someone sends an item to a cuban, they have to pay customs a giant fee. This goes directly to the government.

\- When Cubans want to use the internet, because it's so extremely expensive (look up the prices), they often get the money from Miami, and this money goes directly into the state-owned communications company (operated by the military).  


\- When people visit cuba they have to exchange ALL of their currency for a government-provisioned one (called MLC) which is...again dumping money into the government's pockets.  


The Cuban government comes up with all sorts of schemes to get their hands into all of the money that comes in from abroad. Such as making it illegal to sell food (you can only buy it in their stores using their fake currency), charging extremely high fees for internet (only people with family in the US or EU can afford it), charging extremely high customs fees, passport renewals, etc...  






Cubans work directly for the state. While the regime has grudgingly expanded some limited areas of private enterprise, as of October 2018, there were are only about 588,000 self-employed Cubans in a country of 11.3 million people. Almost every profitable sector of the economy is reserved for the state: manufacturing, mining, construction, tourism, energy, tobacco and sugar production, financial and insurance activities, real estate, engineering, education, journalism, entertainment and sports, among others. Even the “repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles” is officially designated an exclusive preserve of the regime.


What this means is that about 9 in 10 Cuban workers are dependent on the Cuban dictatorship for employment. They cannot change jobs without permission. Their salaries are set by the regime. They cannot negotiate to improve their wages or working conditions — because the only trade union is controlled by the state, which is also their employer. This is a form of social control: Cubans know their livelihoods can be taken away in an instant for the slightest expression of “counterrevolutionary” sentiment.


If U.S. businesses were allowed to operate in Cuba, they would have no choice but to participate in the regime’s exploitation of Cuban workers. Under Cuba’s foreign investment laws, foreign investors in Cuba cannot do business with private citizens; they can do business only with the regime. Foreign businesses are also not allowed to hire Cuban workers directly or pay them in dollars. Foreign investors have to turn to state owned work agencies to provide them with workers. These labor agencies are owned and regulated by the state. They choose and assign workers to the various joint venture companies. They pay workers in Cuban pesos while receiving payment in Dollars and/or Euros.


The Cuban regime literally steals their paychecks. If a foreign hotel chain wants to operate in Cuba, it must pay the Cuban state employment agency $550 a month in hard currency for the services of a general manager. But the general manager doesn’t get that money. Instead, he receives just 400 Cuban pesos, or about $17 U.S. dollars. This is because the government pays him the national average salary set by Cuba’s labor ministry for that specific job, not what the foreign company paid for his services.

What happens to the rest of the money? The regime pockets the difference. The agency and the government take 95% of their wages.



When people demand that the United States lift the embargo, it is arguing that America should go along with it all of this as well. You are effectively advocating the use of slave labor, the repression against cubans, the lack of freedoms and the communist government’s total oversight of virtually all elements of society. The US represents the only opportunity to counterbalance a regime with unlimited power and no institutional oversight. 


The Cuban goverment has shown their unwillingness to change their economic and political systems despite billions of dollars in foreign trade and investment. More money would directly contribute to their increased power (like it has historically done) to suppress internal dissent, not to mention threaten democracies around the world with increased funds for the Cuban military and its adventures abroad/sponsoring of revolutionary movements around Latin America. 



The crazy thing to see is how the Cuban government gains sympathy abroad while the United States, the country that pushes for a change in Cuba, is seen as an evil empire crushing an innocent island. Nevermind that the regime, at which the sanctions are aimed, is responsible for the misery and hopelessness of an entire nation.",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/137sn3k/what_people_dont_understand_about_the_us_embargo/,1683218348.0,137sn3k
elites,CapitalismVSocialism,"Why even free market capitalism becomes a corrupt cartel, even under capitalism's own logic.","There is a reason why we haven't tried ""real capitalism.""

Let's say God creates textbook ideal free market capitalist conditons which businesses compete with eachother on equal footing. Eventually, one or a few of those businesses will start outcompeting the others. This will be rewarded with profits, and since this is free market capitalism, this translates directly to power. 

Free markets work well until there is a power imbalance. Once a power imbalanced is introduced, the powerful can use their power to manipulate how everyone interacts with this market, extracting value from everyone they can and strong arming new competitors out of the market. This bad behavior is rewarded with further profits, which leads to more power, which leads to more ability to manipulate the markets, leading to further profits, and so on. 

It is a vicious cycle that I have never seen addressed. We have seen time and again the bigger businesses can bully or buy their competitors, like what Amazon did to diapers.com. Bigger businesses are also able use their resources to get a head start on new technologies that are supposed to usher in a new era with new businesses, like Microsoft and ChatGPT.  

We are witnessing the cycles of creative destruction being tamed by our elites. In 1929 the reckless abandon of the elites came back to destroy most of them so that labor was able to catch them on the back foot and win a lot of wealth and rights. In 2008 the reckless abandon of the elites was met with bailout that was so swift and thorough, very few of them even lost their job. 

In the USA you can say there was social democracy from about 1945-1979.  From 1980-2007 we has neoloberalism, the closest thing to unrestricted free market capitalism. Since 2008 are have been entering something new, and I can only describe it as capitalist oligarchy teetering on fascism, it is the natural evolution of free market capitalism.

Edit: Lots of capitalists point to businesses failing, but they never mention what happened to the elites responsible for their failure.

brainwashed,CapitalismVSocialism,The vast majority of propertarians were only ever embarrassed Republicans and their silence around tariffs is the proof,"As is evident to everyone except for the most brainwashed, the United States of America, which was until recently the world's premiere economic superpower, lead by the Republican Party, by far recognized as the more ""pro-business"" and ""pro-capitalist"" party of the two parties of the country, is now in the process of executing the most ass backwards and anti free trade policy in a century. This plan will not just cause an immense amount of economic suffering in America but an economic downturn worldwide, a turn of events that seems almost guaranteed to end in an advantageous arrangement for China, one of America's main rivals.

I don't think I have to explain how nonsense the goals of this plan are, nor of how those goals seem to change on a weekly basis. 

The socialists have known for some time that capitalism would eat itself. Though, I imagine it happening it this way comes as a surprise for most. I would have thought the rupture been due to technology and some irreconcilable issue with the environment or automation but it turns out, in a somewhat ironic poetic fashion, that the United States of America will be brought low by the very same kind of monarchic power grab that birthed it in the first place.

Propertarians, what do you make of your conservative fellows turning against free trade and all good economic sense? It was the propertarians that once advocated for open borders(!) but it seems that many propertarians were, as many suspected, just embarrassed Republicans. One would think that the propertarians would be crying bloody murder, rioting in the streets, to see so many of their ideas skewered and roasted by the cult around Trump and yet one hears little from them. I don't get the sense that propertarians are offering even a token resistance to these nonsense ideas, I get the sense the propertarians have either stopped pretending they cared about economics and liberty at all or are deluding themselves into thinking, against all their previous economics theory and knowledge, that Trump might do something right with this.

Propertarians, in the face of this regime that flies directly in the face of so many of your political notions, what are you doing to stop it? Direct action? Protests? Are you talking to your Trumpists fellows about how stupid this all is? Are any of you even managing the meager task of phoning your rep?

brainwashed,CapitalismVSocialism,"C vs S: As of April 2022, 52% of adults consider themselves middle or upper-middle class.","Generally speaking, anyone who isn't living ""paycheck-to-paycheck"" but couldn't necessarily stop working tomorrow and be financially secure for the long-term might consider themselves middle class.

But given different life situations and perceptions of wealth, there's a good chance not everyone who feels middle class actually is, and vice-versa.

Pew  Research center defines ""middle class"" as those earning between two-thirds and twice the median American household income, which in 2021 was $70,784, according to the United States Census Bureau. That means American households earning as little as $47,189 and up to $141,568 are technically in the middle class.

But other factors like family size and location can change what middle class looks like for you. 

So if considering themselves middle class makes people secure....why not an economic system that makes it happen?………why the hatred extremists  far right and far left insist on keeping most of the people in misery?………

brainwashed,CapitalismVSocialism,"Thoughts on Einstein's Article ""Why Socialism""?","I'm curious for input from all sides here. In May 1949 Einstein submitted an article titled ""Why Socialism?"" in which he describes why he believes Socialism to be the answer to our current and future problems. In the discussion that follows I will provide some quotes from Einstein's article, provide some of my own thoughts and ask for your own as well.

>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature.

Einstein describes here what I believe to be a fairly clear issue that both Capitalists and Socialists can agree is a problem in our current society. The fact of the matter is, money is power, and after the Supreme Court case Citizens United v. FEC it is ensured that this power translates to political influence as well. It doesn't matter what your opinions or ideologies are, money, capital, is king. Einstein states that this situation is the direct result of Capitalist society, an observation that I am inclined to agree with.

So, my question to Capitalists: What are your thoughts on Einstein's arguments here? Is this a valid critique of Capitalism, that is to say, is a severe division of labor and uncheckable Capitalist power inherent in the Capitalist system, or are there special circumstances at play here that would otherwise not occur had things shaken out differently?

Einstein continues:

>The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.

Einstein again presses on an issue that I think many can agree is a problem at hand. [6 companies control 90% of media](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6) sources in the U.S. In fact, the Washington Post is directly and personally owned by the most famous capitalist in the country, Jeff Bezos. This argument by Einstein is simply correct. I can see no other perspective on this problem. Regardless, I would like to know your thoughts on this matter.

Einstein then criticizes the so-called ""profit motive.""

>Production is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment; an “army of unemployed” almost always exists. The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job. Since unemployed and poorly paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers’ goods is restricted, and great hardship is the consequence. Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all. The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor, and to that crippling of the social consciousness of individuals which I mentioned before.

It is here that Einstein describes what he calls the ""economic anarchy"" of Capitalism. The profit motive. It is so often the case that those unemployed and homeless, those disaffected by Capitalism are left by the wayside by society. There is simply no profit motive or incentive to help these people. Yet, there is [an increasing number of empty homes](https://www.self.inc/info/empty-homes/), enough to house our entire homeless population. This economic anarchy ensures that humans exist to serve the market rather than the other way around.

>This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism. Our whole educational system suffers from this evil. An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career.

This, I believe, is Einstein's most profound point. The objective of American education is not to educate, but rather to [prepare children to enter the workforce](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/reports/2020/09/14/490338/preparing-american-students-workforce-future/), to create value for the Capitalist class.

Einstein continues, describing what he believes the answer to the inherent failings of Capitalism and the education system that it has created to be.

>I am convinced there is only *one* way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.

This argument I believe is quite clear. In order to avoid the continued evils of capitalism, in order to cease the brainwashing of students, in order to ensure that humanity is served by markets, the answer *must* *be* Socialism.

And yet, there are questions that Einstein leaves us with.

>Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual. The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power, to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?

And so I come to my question for Socialists: How would you answer Einstein? How can you ensure that Socialism will not devolve into the tyranny of bureaucracy, as it has under Capitalism?

brainwashed,CapitalismVSocialism,Why I don’t think “Freedom of Speech” in Capitalism is even effective..,"It's become more and more clear to me in recent times that Americans are brainwashed, DESPITE ALL THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH (propaganda is effective). I've gotten into several arguments with people, and so many Americans are utterly convinced they live in the greatest country in the world. Free speech doesn't matter when the speech is narrowed down to such few topics anyway. Free speech is a product of material conditions. Those conditions must be changed via action to have any real world consequences. At any rate:

•	⁠I talked to someone who genuinely believed only America had freedom of speech and you weren't allowed to criticize politicians in other countries. I mean literally, any other country. They were convinced America had more free speech than Canada, UK, Germany, and Italy; despite having been to some countries.

•	⁠Many Americans (a lot from my family) are truly convinced the only major difference between rich and poor is effort and hard work. They refuse to acknowledge the countless studies and evidence showing that class ascension is much harder in America than in other countries. Income inequality according to them can entirely explained by a difference of work effort.

•	⁠That the United States offers the best chances for a blacks, Latinos, and Asians in the entire world and all of them should be grateful to be here and they should never complain.

•	⁠That being on welfare is remarkably easy and that you actually make more on welfare than you would on a minimum wage job (you don't). I believed this one for years because it was constantly regurgitated by my family.

•	⁠The military is 100% worthwhile and every endeavor they go on is clearly to protect our freedom. Any criticism of the military means that you hate troops and hate freedom and you deserve to leave. It's 2017 and I guarantee you most Americans couldn't tell you the cited reasons by the jihadists in the 9/11 attacks. Most people would probably say it was because ""they hate our freedom.""

•	⁠America is the safest country in the world and other countries have more problems because they have gun control.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/gppxg7/why_i_dont_think_freedom_of_speech_in_capitalism/,1590328002.0,gppxg7
brainwashed,CapitalismVSocialism,Television as a capitalist tool to brainwash the working-class,"Louis CK said something very interesting in his interview with Conan O'brien that was kind of glossed over. 

""I want to get the Emmy but in the end it's just TV, it's something that's gonna be on, just something that's gonna be on in a room where somebody is depressed or masturbating or whatever"" .

&#x200B;

I think he stated this very accurately. The depressing nature of television. It's something that keeps most people (especially proletarians and retired folks) in their living rooms being all lazy and brainwashed. 

NBC, CBS, FOX, and ABC can certainly have good programs. For example, without a doubt, that show *Anthony Bourdain: Places Unknown* is a bourgeois show. In other words, it's a show that those who own private property mostly enjoy. The cosmopolitan professionals of the city as well. 

&#x200B;

But overall, here in America, television is a capitalist tool to keep the masses down. It never really challenges them. Now, of course, the counter-argument is, ""They don't want to be challenged, they like their stupid Jerry Springer riff raff and bland sitcoms"". 

Honestly, yes... I do agree with this. Voltaire said ""It is difficult to free fools from chains they revere"". 

Television really serves two main purposes. 

1. Entertaining people
2. Marketing products 

&#x200B;

There is advertisement between a program (commercials) and there is also advertisement *within* the program either directly or indirectly. But Im more concerned with the first purpose. Entertaining people. 

&#x200B;

I just don't understand how some people watch cable television (and Netflix shows). They literally turn it into an addiction. If you are here on Reddit, you are doing much better than the person who is watching television.

If you like it, I encourage you to write a review on Amazon or Goodreads or some other website!

Here's the blurb:

""Nearly fifty years of outright class war against America’s working and middle classes have brought the country to the brink of social and political collapse. According to some sources, 60 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Since 1975, $80 trillion have been transferred from the bottom 90 percent of earners to the top 1 percent. Meanwhile, little action is being taken to mitigate global warming and ecological destruction, while military budgets, used in part to wage disastrous wars and genocides, climb annually.

""There isn't much hope for the United States, or indeed for civilization, unless we can forge an international left that prioritizes class struggle above all else. It is time to fight back, by any means necessary, against a ruling class interested in nothing but profits and power. In this book, a historian of the U.S. labor movement attempts to advance this agenda through a series of essays on everything from right-wing libertarianism to the inadequacies of identity politics, from the career of Jimmy Hoffa to the catastrophic consequences of American imperialism. Victory in a war for the future of humanity is far from assured, but we’re lucky enough to be living in a time when there’s still some hope.

agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,Increase in money supply and Inflation,"Lolbertarians always claim that if the FED increases money supply then inflation will rise. They explain it like this:

*Increasing the money supply faster than the growth in real output will cause inflation. The reason is that there is more money chasing the same number of goods. Therefore, the increase in monetary demand causes firms to put up prices.*

Sounds like a fairy tail. It's never explained in detail. 
Here's a form of inflation that has a clear explaination:

A bakery sold a lot of bread during the day. The business owner knows that if many people bought his bread, this means that people will accept higher prices, because they desire his good tasting bread (for example) so much. He raises prices. So higher demand of goods leads to inflation. Everyone can comprehend it in an easy way. Inflation always occures if something happens that changes suppy and demand. 

What about the lolbertarian's claim? What on earth does ""more money chasing the same number of goods even mean""? Prices don't rise magically on their own. Real people raise prices, real people are the ones who have money and who spend it. No business owner in the world looks at the money supply in the economy and raises prices according to that. They just made it up for their ideological agenda. 

Their logic is like:

1.Central Bank prints money

2.?

3. Inflation 



The FED doesn't even supply businesses with reserves. Only private banks get reserves. But rising amount of reserves and lower interest on credit doesn't mean that businesses demand more credit. Before covid we had ten years of zero interest in the European Union. Nothing happened, no growth no inflation. 


Stop this nonsense. Everyone in the world knows that higher money supply doesn't increase inflation. Every banker knows it. If they coincide then there's always something else going on. 


You know what? Inflation reduces the money supply. I got 10 Dollars, inflation goes up and I have to pay now 15 dollars. I got less money.

# And to be clear (please read before continuing)

I'm not saying that any of this funding ultimately discredits libertarianism or any of its principles nor is this post meant to be an attack on the libertarian movement or individual libertarians. The point of this is not to point fingers and say ""You're wrong because you're funded by bad guys!""

I'm in big part intending for this post to be a friendly warning to libertarians that many of the groups they follow are being funded by these industries and that this funding [sways their overall message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding_bias), that is after all why these groups dump such large funds into them, and they may be impacting your views in ways you would otherwise not realize.

I am also aware not all of these are strictly ""libertarian"" but rather part of the broader conservative/liberty movement, but they're all groups I see people reference or cite articles from as evidence for their policies or proposed ideas so I think they're worth noting.

# ""But this is just a conspiracy theory! So what if they gave them a few dollars once? They also donated to other non-think tank groups so why is it only bad when they donate to these?""

For one, it wasn't a few bucks. You can see in the sources it was tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars over the span of several years. Several of these think tanks and groups are getting funding from multiple different foundations within the same industry or that are run by the same billionaire families - many are receiving annual donations.

Second, the purpose of these donations is to sway their opinion and to get them to support causes they support. We know they're doing this on purpose from [leaked documents and evidence in court cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry_playbook) which outlined how they sowed disinformation and created the illusion of controversies surrounding topics there was already a scientific consensus on.

It isn't a coincidence that The Cato Institute takes funding from fossil fuel companies and then starts [campaigns challenging the scientific consensus on climate change](https://www.cato.org/commentary/political-assault-climate-skeptics) or the Heritage foundation publishes [articles making false claims that there is more evidence coming out showing climate change isn't a big deal](https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/different-perspective-global-warming), it isn't a coincidence that the Mises Institute takes funding from the tobacco industry and then shares articles about [why smokers are actually oppressed minorities](https://mises.org/mises-wire/tobacco-smokers-americas-most-persecuted-minority). These orgs are trying to appeal to their funders.

And this has a real impact besides just articles posted online a few econ nerds may read. The Cato Institute [funds universities, has affected policy making, and its members have been called on as experts in the media](https://www.cato.org/support/impact-test), The Heritage Foundation is [currently influencing the Trump administration's policies](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations).

# ""But this says nothing about the overall message! Just what they're saying about climate change and tobacco smoking!""

Like I said, this is a fraction of the billionaire and millionaire funding libertarian think tanks receive, and it isn't all from these industries - they just happen to be influential and noteworthy contributors. All these think tanks have spoken out against different policies not directly related to climate change or smoking because they were unfavorable to these industries, often citing libertarian principles as a reason.

For example Cato [published an article about why action against climate change was authoritarian and bad for the economy from a libertarian standpoint](https://www.cato.org/publications/climate-change-national-security-balancing-costs-benefits#benefits), The Mises Institute [argued against tobacco regulation by calling them authoritarian and drawing parallels between them and Nazism](https://mises.org/free-market/are-cigarettes-doomed), The Reason Foundation [conducted a dubious research concluding that policies regularly pushed by fossil fuel companies were the most beneficial way to combat climate change and emphasized the lower taxes and increased competition which reconciled with their libertarian views](https://reason.org/policy-study/evidence-based-policies-to-slow-climate-change/), Americans for Prosperity [successfully lobbied against American Clean Energy and Security Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act) which Cato and Heritage also argued against with dubious cost figures.",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1jb1nkv/who_funds_the_libertarian_movement/,1741951589.0,1jb1nkv
agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,A path to socialism in the USA,"I was asking socialists how they would go about implementing their socialist visions, and I wasn't getting much of a response. In the spirit of [the purpose of a system is what it does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20a%20system%20is%20what%20it%20does%20), questions about how a system would be set up are very important to me, because good intentions don't transform bad systems into good ones. For example, saying you want to end feelings of alienation by the workers doesn't really count if you're the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in 1976. How to obtain goals, along with what those goals are, is somewhat important, to say the least.

So how will socialists achieve their visions?

I'll start with the assumption that worker democracy is a high value of socialists, and that the fact that the 1% owns the boards of all corporations and chooses the CEOs who dictate many of the terms of employment and wages for the working class is one of their major problems with capitalism. Workers don't vote for their managers, they don't vote for the CEOs, they don't have decision making power over what their businesses produce and exchange with others beyond their own employment decisions, and that's a bad thing. That's one of the worst things about capitalism. If I'm wrong, I promise I'm not trying to straw man you. Seems like a common theme when it comes up.

Let's assume that we want a socialist system with a nation state that does implement some centralized economic planning like universal healthcare. This seems like a good assumption because of how popular universal healthcare is amongst socialists, and it's unclear how the healthcare industry in a decentralized economy guarantees universal healthcare without one. It seems like a very questionable assumption to assume that worker democracy in the healthcare system decides to make all sacrifices necessary to guarantee every human being healthcare. At some point, the healthcare democracy draws a line in terms of what they provide, and how you guarantee all of those decisions across healthcare worker concerns somehow gives every person all the healthcare they want and need is not clear. I wouldn't assume it. So, let's just say we want a socialist nation state so we can guarantee everyone their basic needs like healthcare. Again, I promise you I'm not trying to straw man you. If you have a great explanation for how decentralized healthcare worker co-ops can be counted on to guarantee everyone healthcare without a mandate, let me know.

So how could we begin the process of transitioning the USA to a more socialist state? Or, how could we begin to implement worker democracy over the means of production, and take it away from the 1%? The constitution  prevents confiscation of industries without due process. So how could the national government force businesses allow for worker democracy?

Well, there are constitutional mechanisms at play here that could accomplish this task, and nationalize all industries within due process of law, and without constitutional amendment. For example, the congress of the USA sets the budget. They decide what the USA spends its money on: what it buys and sells. And it's constitutional for the US government to purchase stock. It's also within the power of the government to have the federal reserve print money and loan it to the US government. Combining these together, it's theoretically possible for the government to make an arrangement with the Fed and finance purchasing every corporation. Since they purchased the corporations from their owners, they followed due process of law.

Since the US government would now be the owner of all of these corporations, they would have the power to choose the board of directors. Naturally, they would choose themselves, and make themselves the functional board of directors. Or, to put it another way, all of these corporations would become extensions of the federal government, and congress's legislative power would extend to setting the strategic direction of every corporation. This would be a huge increase in the democracy of our economic system. Instead of the 1% choosing themselves to be the board and setting goals in their own self-interest, our elected representatives would be setting the agenda.

However, congress is just the legislature. The executive executes, so to speak. So who would be responsible for executing these strategic objectives within these newly nationalized industries, according to the will of the people? Well, that would be the president. So the president would see to the appointment of all CEOs of all businesses. Their job would be to execute business plans in accordance with the laws established by congress. Essentially every employee would be a de facto federal employee, working for the executive branch of the government, headed by the president of the United States, who is Donald Trump. And since the president of the United States is democratically elected, this would be a drastic increase in the democracy of our economy.

This could be followed up with additional laws that establish how workers can choose their own, local management in the newly nationalized industries, allowing even more worker democracy.

In addition, many of the issues of democracy within the United States could begin to be addressed, but some might require constitutional amendments. For example, the US Senate seems like a fairly undemocratic institution, since its representatives aren't chosen proportionally to the workers. Therefore, an amendment would be necessary to get rid of the US Senate. Similarly, there may be amendments necessary to overcome the first amendment right to free speech, so that we could effectively control political speech for the sanctity of our elections. I'm sure you can think of numerous improvements.

All of these things would translate into a drastic increase in the worker democracy. Workers would be able to choose their managers. National elections would dictate that businesses serve the interests of all the workers, not just themselves.

Now, I admit, there will be a certain tension between national and local worker democracy. Going back to universal healthcare: I can see a situation where an understaffed healthcare industry may not want to democratically vote themselves to work huge amounts of overtime to guarantee everyone healthcare. That's why there needs to be a balance between local worker's democracy and national workers democracy. Nurse's can vote on some issues, but they can't vote themselves so much free time that people go without medicine. That's just common sense, and while I can see how this tension between local and national democracy might seem less empowering to the workers than other arrangements, perhaps anarchic arrangements, that this is necessary given the assumptions and the desire to give to everyone according to their needs.

This is one way that socialism could be implemented in the United States, nationalizing all industries, having Donald Trump appoint the top-level leadership of all industries and execute their economic plans in accordance to the will of the people as expressed by congress, guaranteeing everyone their basic needs, while also allowing worker democracy to choose low and mid-level management that bests suits them.

This would be a massive increase in the democracy of the workplace, much more than what we have with the 1% running all of the businesses of the United States.

agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,is the existance of money rooted in human malevolence?,"my vision of utopia is one where the people are truly in power. it is built on mutual trust and a common good. where people just cooperate because they know it is in their best interest and the best interest of mankind. the instant that we begin to cut up and divide the resources amongst ourselves, is when we subtract from the wealth of collective. When we all share the wealth and resources of our universe, we are all as rich as the cosmos itself! 

the goal here is to further our civilization and to evolve into a place of harmony and abundance. the abundance is already here, we just can’t manage it because other humans will take it out of whatever chaos lies within them. harmony could be achieved right this instant if we 1. didn’t have to fight an oppressive government first. and 2. would just come together for a common good, and provide eachother with what we need, because it’s the right thing to do for all parties involved.

this is rooted in an abundance mindset. where there is no need for barter or a monetary system because there is enough to go around for everyone. if their isn’t enough of a specific resource, then their is enough to meet whatever need must be met. all manner of materials are simply allocated to where they need to go for the creative development of our civilization out of consensus. something get done because it is simply the best common sense course of action to get from point A to point B. 

the instant we introduce any form of trade, we manufacture layers upon layers of beuraracracy which we must fight to get even the most basic of needs met. we see imbalances in wealth and resources. 

exhibit A: trying to shoot rockets to mars while people are starving and the earth is dying.

the way I see it, is that money and trade exists as a system put in place by those of us who want to have more than another. out of greed. it exists purely out of a separation mindset rather than a collective good mindset. 

simply through our participation in a monetary/trade system, we all support the agenda of those who operate out of greed and malevolence. they control us through controlling the flow of basic resources. you cant live on land without paying taxes. everything you might want to do is behind the wall of licensing. 

but to say that we cannot free ourselves from this oppression would be incorrect. the words I find rising out of me now are to seize the modes of production. 

we could start communes and try to evolve our society through living like we did in medieval times with the advent of commodities used to keep us tame and content rather than furious to uproot the system in place. 

or we could seize the modes of production and live like we’re supposed to—using technology to further our civilization and not to enslave our minds in a phone or a computer or a television. think of how much time, energy, and mental power is being wasted amongst the masses because it is being sucked into consumerism and entertainment. into jobs and games and actions that all serve to distract and numb us, or further the agenda of the separatists, rather than the collectivists.

but to seize the modes of production? how would we do such a thing? how would we unite the world by force? well… I don’t know. they would probably use their gargantuan military against us—that is, if they still have enough people to fuel it. but we’re getting to point—we’re already there, actually—where they don’t need people—they have AI. 

The only way I see this working, is by

A: engaging in a war with our techno-overlords for the cause of literally all things good in the world. truly a religious battle of light and dark—before they become too huge to dismantle.

or

B: Not sure how this would happen, but somehow find a way to open up the infinite wisdom and love and peace within all malevolent beings. 

ultimately, whether you accept this truth or not, the root of all of our problems truly is money. they say, “but the bible says that the LOVE of money is the root of all evil! not money itself!” but in truth, it’s both. money is born out of seperationism, and as long as their is separation, there will be conflict.

the fact is that we the people will never not have the power to atleast try to change things. we are at a turning point in our civilization where these people can use AI to manufacture a system so gargantuan that to dismantle it will become a task larger than creating a harmonious civilization after it is gone. every day that goes by, it only gets harder.

agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,The Wealthy Thrive During Inflation and Recession Without Doing Nothing,"The rich are often insulated from the worst effects of the economic downturn, while the poor suffer the most. This is because the wealthy have the means to weather financial storms and even profit from them, while the poor are left struggling to make ends meet.

For the wealthy, inflation can actually be a good thing. Assets like stocks, real estate, and gold tend to rise in value during times of inflation, and those who own these assets can see their wealth increase even as the cost of living goes up. The rich can also take advantage of low-interest rates to borrow money at favorable terms, which they can then use to invest in businesses or real estate, further increasing their wealth.

In contrast, the poor often have few assets to fall back on during inflation. They may have limited savings and little or no investments, so they are hit hard by rising prices for basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. For those living paycheck to paycheck, inflation can mean the difference between being able to afford a decent standard of living and falling into poverty.

Recessions also tend to hit the poor hardest. During an economic downturn, businesses may lay off workers or reduce hours, making it difficult for those who are already struggling to make ends meet to find employment. The poor are also more likely to have jobs in industries that are particularly vulnerable during a recession, such as hospitality or retail.

At the same time, the rich can often take advantage of the opportunities that arise during a recession. They may be able to buy distressed assets like real estate or businesses at a discount, further increasing their wealth. And because they have the means to weather financial storms, they can often afford to hold onto assets during a downturn, knowing that they will likely increase in value once the economy recovers.

While the wealthy can use their resources to insulate themselves from economic hardship, the poor are left struggling to make ends meet, often with little hope of relief. This underscores the need for policies that address inequality and ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities, regardless of their income.",37,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/12crc62/the_wealthy_thrive_during_inflation_and_recession/,1680715087.0,12crc62
agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,"If Bill Gates And Elon Musk Actually Cared About Climate Change, They’d Stop Schmoozing China","Elon Musk and Bill Gates have long quibbled over who cares more about climate change. In April, Musk refused a climate-related philanthropic contribution from Gates because the Microsoft co-founder made a multibillion-dollar bet against his Tesla car company. Gates responded by claiming he gives a lot more to climate change causes than anyone else does, including Musk.

Unfortunately, as is common with elites who promote climate activist agendas, both ignore the big picture about ensuring human and planetary health around the globe, and their preferred remedies to these policy concerns will only make things worse.

Those predisposed to believing in “dangerous anthropogenic climate change” and the need to increase government power to resolve the supposed crisis have drawn their predictable conclusions. But objective studies establish that the evidence does not credibly support assertions that manmade greenhouse gases are causing dangerous warming and weather.

The movement’s standard-bearers have glossed over inconvenient evidence for years. Earth’s climate has always changed, and for decades the predicted disasters have turned out to be false prophecies. In reality, far more people die in cold weather than in hot spells, and a slightly warmer planet would be quite beneficial for both humanity and the plant and animal kingdoms.

What evidence proves that today’s climate fluctuations and weather events aren’t due to the same natural forces that have affected Earth throughout history? Tornado [records](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2018/12/26/will-be-first-year-with-no-violent-tornadoes-united-states/) show more violent twisters from 1950-1985 than during the years since, and not a single Category 3-5 hurricane made U.S. landfall for a record 12 years, 2005-2017. Why should we disrupt our energy, economy, and living standards because computer models claim there’s a crisis? 

As much as Gates and Musk claim to disagree with these realities, their actions don’t show it. Like Al Gore, John Kerry, and Leonardo DiCaprio, they both fly private planes regularly, which is supposedly a no-no for stalwarts of the climate cause (even though hundreds of private jets flew wealthy alarmists to the 2021 Glasgow climate summit).

Billionaire climate club members do something else at odds with environmental ethics: They frequently do business with China.

Musk is quite cozy with the communist regime. From taking billions in regime-funded loans, to speaking for an event at their embassy, to building a factory in Xinjiang amid the Uyghur genocide, the world’s richest man is surprisingly comfortable working with a state founded on ideologies based on hatred and abuse. 

Gates stretched the limits of U.S. security laws to help China build nuclear reactors that are particularly suitable for powering naval vessels. He did this as China continued making strategic long-term moves to control ever-larger swaths of the Pacific Ocean and surpass U.S. naval power in critical areas.

Not only do these billionaires have no problem working with China, but they also rarely, if ever, criticize the regime. In fact, Musk regularly praises it, saying it “rocks” and meeting with communist officials on multiple occasions. This is perplexing, since China is by far the world’s biggest carbon dioxide emitter.

A recent CNN [report](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/28/world/china-us-climate-cop26-intl-hnk/index.html) found that in 2019, China’s greenhouse gas emissions were approximately 2.5 times those of the United States — and “more than all the world’s developed countries combined.” China emitted 14.1 billion metric tons of CO2-equivalent that year, making up more than a fourth of the emissions from the entire world. Given these statistics, why are Musk and Gates so quick to criticize America but never reprimand China?

They clearly don’t live by the environmental principles they preach and, at a minimum, appear hesitant to criticize the world’s worst greenhouse gas emitter, toxic chemicals polluter, and child and slave labor practitioner. Making matters worse, the policies they push will weaken, not strengthen, the cause of public health.

Killing American fossil fuels just causes them to be replaced by dirtier foreign sources, and in particular Chinese and Russian production.

He suggested that we instead start “attacking carbon emissions, not energy sources, through carbon capture, American innovation, natural solutions, and other paths that boost the American economy while reducing global emissions.”

Indeed, over the last decade, the United States has reduced carbon emissions more than any other country in the world. It is part of the solution, not part of the problem.

Yet Musk, Gates, and other billionaires who promote climate alarmism continue to support policies like the Paris Climate Accords, which would impose significant restrictions on the United States while allowing China to continue increasing emissions through 2030. Musk went so far as to stop serving on President Donald Trump’s advisory panels to protest the president’s decision to withdraw from this counterproductive agreement.

If these climate activists wish to make a difference in human and environmental health around the world, they must change their perspective and their relationship with Communist China. At a minimum, they must begin practicing what they preach. 

Unfortunately, they appear unwilling to do so. They’d rather make noise than foster productive change.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/vscsbe/if_bill_gates_and_elon_musk_actually_cared_about/,1657067722.0,vscsbe
agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,We Should Immediately End Nationalized Funding of Student Tuition,"“Well, I guess the Communists know that the old people living in America today are not going to make the revolution. They are not the people who count. They count on the young people, and those who control the youth are the people who control the future of this country.”

—Former Communist Bella V. Dodd, before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, 1953

In 2010, President Obama nationalized student tuition loans by making the government the “sole provider” of government-backed college tuition loans. By doing so, Obama effectively eliminated banks as the conduit of choice for government-backed tuition-loan financing. Similarly, when Obama pushed for the government to make Obamacare the “single-payer” a nationalized health care system, the obvious consequence would be to eliminate employer-sponsored and insurance company-provided health insurance from the market.

On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Act charging the U.S. Department of Education to make 100 percent of all government-funded college loans, effective on July 1 of that year. In 2010, student loan debt totaled $760 billion. In 2022, the total outstanding student loan debt will more than [double](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2022/05/16/student-loan-debt-statistics-in-2022-a-record-17-trillion/?sh=47224b924d5a) to a record $1.7 trillion. In 2017, a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York [concluded](https://www.cato.org/blog/federal-student-loans-rising-tuition-costs-insider-speaks) that “more federal aid to students enables colleges to raise tuition more.” Raising U.S. higher education tuition costs to a level middle-class families cannot afford is not a problem as long as the government makes the taxpayer pay the price.

Meanwhile, colleges and universities have utilized the increased tuition revenue to flourish into today’s bastion of critical-theory-driven neo-Marxist political correctness.

As one-time communist Bella Dodd made clear in her 1953 HUAC testimony, revolution starts by indoctrinating the youth. Obama appears to have understood the operative principle here: namely, what the government funds, the government controls. The Supreme Court memorialized this principle in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991). In Rust v. Sullivan, an abortion case, the Supreme Court held organizations receiving federal grants under the Public Health Service Act could not refuse to support abortion as a method of family planning, despite First Amendment free-speech protections. But the corollary to the precept that “What the Government Funds, the Government Controls” is this: “Absent the Trillions of Taxpayer Dollars the Government Wants to Spend, Student Tuition Loan Programs Wither and Die.”

A large majority of U.S. student loans are made or guaranteed by the federal government, and without federal backing, the student loan system would collapse. As all Marxist-trained radicals understand, keeping the youth indoctrination system of the U.S. higher education system in the hands of a federal bureaucracy is essential. The system functioning as a form of ideological reprogramming is critical to the Gramsci-style Maoist cultural revolution’s goal of destroying the fundamental values inherent in American exceptionalism.

Since the student protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and ’70s, college students have been able to get degrees in Hispanic Studies, Women’s Studies, and African American studies. The developing theme was that the United States is a racist, imperialist state that has colonized minorities by denying them equal rights.

Today, the Neo-Marxist critical theory classes that dominate higher education have indoctrinated a generation of students into a hate-America agenda. In 2017, the governing board of the American College Personnel Association (ACPA) adopted the following theme for their annual conference: “Strategic Imperative for Racial Justice and Decolonization.” Talking points prepared for the ACPA’s meeting included: “Racism and colonization are real, present, enduring, intersectional, and systematic forms of oppression,” and “Advocacy and social justice require us to work to dismantle racism and colonialization in higher education.”

The intolerance of radical leftist students subjects their conservative counterparts to constant allegations that their “offensive speech” is an unacceptable “micro-aggression.” Why? Perhaps the conservative student committed the unforgivable sin of using the wrong pronoun in referring to a person’s “gender identity.” Data compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2021 found exceptionally high unemployment rates among recent college graduates. With some one-third of recent college graduates underemployed, working in jobs that did not require a college degree, we might consider that a “social justice” college degree is inadequate preparation for lucrative employment in an advanced post-industrial society.

Despite Obama’s dramatic increase in student tuition loans, radical socialist Democrats like Bernie Sanders, when he campaigned for president in 2020, argued for eliminating existing student debt to provide a free college education for everyone. “I believe that education is the future for this country, and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free and eliminate student debt, and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street"". While President Biden has not endorsed free college for everyone, he has considered forgiving $10,000 of student debt to mobilize the Democratic Party voter base in the upcoming 2022 mid-term elections. How did we come as a nation to this point in American history?

In 1965, Herbert Marcuse, the champion of the radical student protests in the 1960s and ’70s, wrote an essay entitled “Repressive Tolerance.” That essay was seminal to the intolerance of today’s critical theory neo-Marxists dominating higher education campuses in America today. In “Repressive Tolerance,” Marcuse concluded that “the realization of the objective of tolerance would call for intolerance toward prevailing policies, attitudes, opinions, and the extension of tolerance to policies, attitudes, and opinions that are suppressed.”2/

Marcuse argued for a different standard, one of “liberating tolerance.” Marcuse’s new standard required censoring policies, attitudes, opinions, etc., that supported what Marcuse saw as the dominant repressive and alienating nature of advanced industrial societies such as the United States. By this twisted logic, the neo-Marxist accusation of “white privilege” became violently intolerant. After Marcuse, all subjects taught at the university level, including mathematics and the hard sciences, have been politicized as “racist.”

In medical triage, the first principle is to stop the bleeding. So, too, ending the government-funding of student tuition loans will begin the process of killing off the student loan program. Without this funding, higher education institutions will not as quickly indoctrinate future generations of American youth into critical theory neo-Marxist ideology. If we do not cut off the budget now, American exceptionalism will undoubtedly fade among future generations, perhaps beyond recovery.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/vqso7u/we_should_immediately_end_nationalized_funding_of/,1656887054.0,vqso7u
agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,Democracy cannot work in a society where extreme inequality of wealth exists. Either the poor vote to seize the property of the rich or the rich use their wealth to bribe state officials into manipulating votes and devising policies in their favor. This is why NO democracy has ever been successful.,"Nor will ever be successful if past experience is our guide.

Democracy as we know it is a failure any way you look at it. In fact, every democracy throughout history has been a failure, inevitably devolving into tyranny. You have the Athenian democracy, the first democracy in history, which devolved into tyranny; you have the Roman republican democracy, which devolved into tyranny; you have the Venetian republic, which also devolved into tyranny.

Even in the United States, arguably the world’s most successful democracy, the republican democracy originally established by the colonists devolved into a mass democracy which in turn has devolved into the full-blown totalitarian democracy we see under CCP puppet President Poopy Pants. The so-called western democracies have also followed suit, all becoming totalitarian democracies in a few short years (or slowly over the course of decades, depending on how you look at it) under the new scientific-technological elites Eisenhower warned against. Canada and Australia are examples of totalitarian democracies *par excellence*, with both states now no different from China in terms of corruption and ruthless tyranny.

I suspect Western mass democracies are now totalitarian democracies because of massive wealth inequality. Over the decades, wealth has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of the 1%. This wealth polarization was further exacerbated by the stock market crash of early 2020 and the ravages of the “pandemic,” which created new billionaires. These super-rich were able to bribe the MSM and academia to indoctrinate Western citizens into believing certain narratives, narratives that covertly favored elite agendas; they also bribed state legislators into installing unelected bureaucratic officials to set up technocracy and go through with a variety of Build Back Better programs, subverting the democratic process to favor the dystopian policies of global billionaires.

The solution to the problems posed by mass democracy, relative economic egalitarianism, is a socialist one and will lead to seizure and redistribution of the wealth of the rich, again subverting the democratic process.

Democracy has always failed us in the past and is failing us now with potentially catastrophic consequences for the survival of the entire human species. This isn’t an argument for autocracy. Ideally democracy should be unanimous direct democracy, participatory enough that individual autonomy is respected. This means that every vote counts and no one is coerced into submitting to laws he does not support. However, this requires a level of radical decentralization, relative economic egalitarianism and municipalization, of both the political structure and economy, leading to the complete transformation of Western society, politics and economy, something entirely impractical and unacceptable given the contemporary situation and TPTB.",114,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/voq5if/democracy_cannot_work_in_a_society_where_extreme/,1656643997.0,voq5if
agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,Opinion: Direct democracy is a bad idea. Elected democracy is a bad idea. The alternative is Jury Democracy.,"A lot of socialists want to implement some sort of democracy yet they usually don't offer good specifics. Or, what has been tried, in my opinion has failed. Workplace democracy just isn't going to work if you don't know how to set up democracy in the first place. Without knowing how to run a ""Real Democracy (TM)"", unions will also fail, let alone the government.

Why is direct democracy bad?
------------------------------
Direct democracy suffers from the problem of scalability. Past a committee of about 20 people, communication becomes more and more difficult. Past 1000 people, mass media, advertising, propaganda, and name recognition start playing a massive role. 

Normal people also lose the ability to set the agenda in direct democracy. With 20 people, anyone can make a proposal or an amendment. With 100,000 people, normal people lose the ability to make proposals or amendments. Instead, proposals/amendments must be *filtered* using some sort of mechanism such as a referendum. 
What will the filter be? Maybe some sort of signature requirement. Maybe selection by a undemocratic external committee. Whatever the requirement, requirements force people to concentrate resources together, hire manpower, and engage in advertising/lobbying to fulfill the requirement, ultimately biasing the process in favor of the affluent elite. 

Why are elections bad?
-----------------------
Elections are mediocre for the same reason why mass direct democracy through referendums is mediocre. Like referendums, agenda setting - who is allowed to run on the ballot - is left to some vague entity. Mass media and advertising, and therefore the influence of affluence, have enormous effect on results. Even worse, policy is further distorted by political parties and the specifics of the election system. Are we using ""First Past the Post""? Are we using ""Party List""? Political parties and party insiders ultimately choose who shall be on the ballot, leading to bureaucratic elite capture. 

Elections were described by Aristotle as a form of ""oligarchy"" over 2000 years ago. As it was in ancient Athens, elections typically select the wealthy and affluent. In contrast, Aristotle described a system where people ""Rule in Turns"" - sortition, lottocracy, or the ""Selection of magistrates by lots"" as a more naturally ""Democratic"" way to govern. 

What's the Alternative?
------------------------
The alternative to direct democracy and election is the 3rd wheel of Democracy - Juries. In a modern implementation, a Parliamentary body would be chosen by a lottery of the citizens of a jurisdiction. For example 500 citizens could be selected to compose a Citizen's Parliament. 

- Like courtroom juries, a legislative jury would be paid or mandated to serve their country. 
- Like courtroom juries, a legislative jury would be given time and resources to look into the specifics in far greater detail. We would never trust the public to vote on the guilt or innocence of a defendant on trial for obvious reasons. The public hasn't studied the case in detail and therefore can only render ignorant judgments. A jury in contrast, is given the opportunity to study the details to render informed verdicts. 


For a milder implementation, we can try Bicameral Jury Democracy. Here, one house of Parliament remains elected and the other becomes Jury-selected. 
For a more radical implementation, we can completely replace the legislature with multiple Jury houses that check-and-balance each other in what is known as ""Multi-Body-Sortition"". 

Jury democracy solves several issues:

- Reduce the influence of mass media & advertising in favor of expert & bureaucratic influence (Where do the bureaucrats comes from? Like with other governments, legislatures usually hire & fire them).
- Construct a descriptively representative parliament that looks & thinks like the people it serves. 
- Cutting away the influence of the ""ignorant masses"" in favor of ""deliberative"" lottery selected citizens capable of talking, launching investigations, deploying government resources, and negotiating with one another. 


How about Small Scale Democracy?
------------------------------------
As far as for the use in smaller unions and cooperatives with far fewer participants, jury democracy will not work as well because it cannot take advantage of the ""Law of Large Numbers"" to construct representative statistical samples of the population. However, jury democracy can be used to establish a permanent ""accountability committee"" on an elected officer. Alternatively, jury democracy can be used to select executive officers. Rather than relying on uninformed and ignorant members, a council (selected by lottery) can be formed as a hiring committee. 


What about Accountability?
----------------------------
The accountability mechanism of juries is slightly weaker than elections. In elections, the masses must rely on mass media to tell them who is corrupt and who is not. With the proliferation of propaganda and fake news, it may soon become difficult to impossible for the masses to distinguish between credible corruption vs a smear campaign. 

Moreover, merely replacing an elected official is not synonymous with holding that official accountable. Imagine that an official takes a bribe of $1 million, and the people respond by un-electing him. So? That official still retains his bribe. What matters then is the existence of a functional judicial branch, or other members of Parliament holding him accountable through impeachment or criminal proceedings. The same would be true in Jury-style legislatures.",43,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/rseqdc/opinion_direct_democracy_is_a_bad_idea_elected/,1640905026.0,rseqdc
agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,[Everyone] Does the ASF-IWA Geelong make valid points in this article?,"Hi everyone.

After having some disagreements with some supporters of the Australian Labor Party (socdems and one of the two major political parties in Australia) I'd like to cite some passages from this text written by the ASF-IWA, an anarcho-syndicalist group in Australia (that I am not affiliated with, I also don't align with their Syndicalist politics) to see if people agree:

>Given that a government of socialists, either in the minority or majority, do not control the entire apparatus of the state under bourgeois democracy, they must attempt to implement a minimum plan. As standard practice, socialists argue to increase taxes on the rich, or to use funds from other state sectors and invest them in poorer communities. This is all well and good, but by involving themselves in this task, they suddenly find themselves burdened with running the very  system they claim to want to overthrow. Consider what would happen if a Victorian Socialist candidate is elected and achieves some of the aims of their manifesto, for example, the proposed recycling plant in the northern suburbs. Though the plant will provide some positives – it will create jobs, and meet environmental needs – in a capitalist system, workers will inevitably struggle with their pay and working conditions. Subsequently, the socialist councilors will have to mediate the struggle and potentially discipline striking workers. This highlights an inherent  contradiction when ‘revolutionaries’ in government have no choice but to administer the capitalist state. The greatest idealism is shipwrecked on the shores of the reality of capitalist economics. It may sound like quite an abstraction, but [historical precedence](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4864092.stm) would indicate this is a very real concern. Throughout history workers have had to face ‘socialist’ strikebreaking many times.  
>  
>When a party measures progress by the vote tally they can become obsessed with chasing numbers. Imagine a campaign that may have initially started with a radical program. As the party gains seats and power, it is likely to drop its more radical ideals in order to maintain its positions in parliament. Though supposedly progressive, in its last terms of government Labors inability to legislate for gay marriage was a clear example of acting from fear of being ‘too radical.’ In the end,  it was the conservatives that legalised gay marriage – after decades of pressure from social movements. We see the same process taking place today with the rightward shift of the Greens, from an activist party to  one of ‘professional politicians’. Slowly but surely, Victorian Socialists, like every socialist party before them, will become more invested in the running of, and for positions within, the state, until such a situation that they become the very defenders of electoral  democracy.   
>  
>We know that it is social movements and struggle that force politicians left, not parliament. If that were not true, we wouldn’t have seen significant reforms benefiting the working class come from conservative politicians during periods of mass movement and rebellion. On February 19th this was proven once again with the striking teachers in West Virginia, USA, defeating market-oriented reforms by Republican politicians. By contrast, we wouldn’t have seen leftist parties around the world implement tragic and authoritarian laws and punishments upon the working class again and again, betraying them at pivotal moments.   
>  
>Elections build the idea that you sign someone up, everyone votes, and when the preferred representative gets into parliament, the party’s demands are implemented. It’s fun and it’s easy to hand out ‘how to vote’ cards – to spruik the virtues of your preferred candidate against the others – but it doesn’t develop the critical relationship with electoral and capitalist politics we have to work towards. Millions of people today are disaffected with politicians. Adding socialists to the list of vultures that ‘get voted in and do nothing’ will not help us build revolutionary ideology. Parliamentary activity does very little to build the capacity of the working class itself to struggle, let alone the idea that the working class can run the world.  
>  
>In practical terms, consider the example of Kasama Sawant, the Socialist Alternative (unrelated to the Australian grouping of the same name) councillor in Seattle. Kasama was elected in 2013, hailed as a major breakthrough as the first ‘socialist’ elected anywhere in the USA  for generations. She was elected around a demand for “$15 Now”, that is  $15 an hour minimum wage within the Seattle region. She faced  significant hostility from business interests, and was funded by the  unions to fight for this platform. Though elected, she failed to get  this reform through and ‘$15 now’ became ‘$15 later..’ Whilst in Seatac, a city basically next door, the labour movement maintaining autonomy managed to get a republican to pass the legislation without sacrificing  themselves to parliamentary limits. The limits of relying on politicians is clear; we see Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez voting to fund ICE in the USA, while simultaneously claiming to want its abolition. The DSA project is yet another example of a growing anti-capitalist consciousness kneecapped by electoral politics. While it is as much a reflection of the current limits of politics within our unions, and paltry compared to the donations to the Labor  party, the funds given to the Victorian Socialist project could have  gone into ‘on the ground’ organising efforts, fighting campaigns and  strike funds.  
>  
>We believe they made a fundamental mistake by participation in the first place. The left can be more effective in power at implementing capitals agenda than the right, as social movements that become invested in a party take their foot off the gas in order to allow the new government to ‘perform.’ As such, all the resources that went into the struggles within SYRIZA who would inevitably betray the Greek people by virtue of participation in the state could have gone into developing an even more militant element to the class struggle in Greece. To the union movement and building strikes, to the anti-fascist struggle, to the countless occupations and direct action struggles, to defending the worker controlled factories like [VioME](http://www.viome.org/) – where we see embryonic forms of workers democracy and expropriation of capitalist interests. As Fred Hampton points out, you have to build power where the people are. As anarchists we know that these new forms of social power are infinitely more important than the struggle within parliament.   
>  
>Far more important than winning over militants from the socialist groups however is winning new workers over to the anarchist movement. For too long the anarchist movement in Australia has been internal looking. Our struggle as libertarians should be where the working class itself is fighting, and our ideas should inform our action. It will be our motion that draws people in, not just our ideas – this for example is part of the initial explosion of ‘success’ of the Victorian Socialist project.  
>  
>Anti-capitalist ideas are growing traction around the world, and we want anarchism to become the dominant form of revolutionary politics once again. It is easy to forget that anarchism was once the predominant ideology of the revolutionary left, a far cry from the liberal mess we find passing for much of anarchist politics today. To return to relevance, we require insertion into the important movements and struggles of our time to help build their mass character, and playing a leading role in the redevelopment of a labour movement. To counter the growth of electoral projects anarchists also need easy ‘on ramps’ to politics too, but not ones that will channel workers into handing their fate over to political parties. To build our own organisations and militant movements requires developed and specifically anarchist politics to guide our strategies and tactics. It is our task to reveal the fatal flaw of following strategies like the Victorian Socialists electoral attempts, and reaffirming that the revolution can only be made by the struggle of the workers themselves.

agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,"[All] There is No Problem With Taxation, but There Is a Clear Problem with the Commodification of Labor","I'm going to preface what I am going to say here by noting that I consider myself to be a Marxist. Most of my points below are going to be traditional liberal ideas, and I don't want people to get too confused and think I'm just a conservative.

**Ok, here is why taxation is A-OK:**

1. [""Governments are instituted among Men"" (dang, sexist language: ""among people"") ""to secure"" ""certain unalienable Rights."" ""A\]mong these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness""](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript) (Yay! Thomas Jefferson!)
2. Governments cannot secure ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" without taxation. (Yay! common sense!)
3. [Governments ""deriv\[e\] their just powers from the consent of the governed""](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript) (Yay! Thomas Jefferson again!)
4. The governed therefore elect politicians who institute taxation. (Yay!, the governed not being stupid!)
5. If you do not go pay your taxes, you should go to jail. (Yay!, rule of law!)
6. There is a danger of even democratic governments getting a little carried away and becoming ""destructive of these ends"" (you know, the ends of ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" as well as ""unalienable Rights""). Accordingly, it makes sense to impose some restrictions on even democratic governments. We call these restrictions ""human rights."" Depending on your country, they include, for example, [the Bill of Rights](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript),[the Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights), and [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx), and even, for example, the International Labour Organization's [International Labour Standards](https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/the-benefits-of-international-labour-standards/lang--en/index.htm).
7. There is absolutely nothing in human rights law that claims that states cannot tax people. In fact, human rights law all agrees that states have an obligation ""to secure"" human rights for their populations. (Yay! human rights law for not being dumb!)

**Now for the hot-headed Marxist part:**

Despite, all these very noble and humane sentiments, there is an obvious problem with rich people and business interests buying themselves political office (Donald Trump, cough, cough) and exercising undue political influence (by way of campaign donations, revolving doors, etc.)

They use their influence to sucker people (often by way of [public relations campaigns and think tanks](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch) and to fight off social democratic reforms. That, for example is why meaningful action on global climate change is off the political agenda even as newspapers all over the world are freaking out about climate change every day. For an illustration how these moneyed interests go about messing with democratic governments, see, for example, [Exxon's campaign against climate change regulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v1Yg6XejyE).

Much of the ability to wealthy actors to do this boils down to deeply rooted inequality within every capitalist society: a labor market in which plentiful workers compete with other workers for scarce jobs. Technically, this inequality of power could be addressed with the state taking responsibility to ensure labor rights, such as the rights to full employment and the right to collective bargaining, etc. Human rights law actually goes a long way to demanding that states do just this. See, for example, [Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights):

> Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.  
>  
>Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.  
>  
>Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.  
>  
>Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.

But, in practice, capitalist states violate these rights extensively. As a result, large sections of the population in even advanced capitalist countries wind up born into structural poverty and have their rights to ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" undermined.

In other words, even though capitalist states [may say](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/full-employment-balanced-growth-act-humphrey-hawkins-act-1034), for instance, that all citizens ""have a right... to work"" and that the capitalist state has an obligation to turn that right into a ""practical reality"" by adopting ""all practical programs and policies to promote full employment,"" in reality, the capitalist state does little to nothing to further this goal because [rich people hate full employment](https://delong.typepad.com/kalecki43.pdf). Full employment, after all, reverses the normal conditions in a capitalist economy and thereby shifts the balance of class forces by creating a situation in which employers must compete with other employers for scarce workers. In Marxist terms, it eliminates the[""Industrial Reserve Army of Labor""](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm). Despite this, sustaining full employment is a key part of what one section of international human rights law refers to as the principle that [""labour is not a commodity""](https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/the-benefits-of-international-labour-standards/lang--en/index.htmb). Well, clearly, capitalist societies do treat labor as if it is just an ordinary commodity, and that's the reason we socialists object to ""wage labor"" under capitalism and say it's ""exploitative,"" ""wage slavery,"" and all the rest of it. Put alternately, if capitalist markets really were characterized by consensual free exchanges between equally free (read equally empowered) people, capitalist profits would not occur for the obvious reason that no empowered capitalist worker would say to their employer, ""Boss man, you just go ahead and keep as much of the profits we all worked together to create as you like, you especially bright, hard working guy, you.""

When we factor in the problem of dis-empowered, commodified labor along with all the other egregious human rights violations and violations of ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" that even [advanced capitalist states routinely engage in](https://www.hrw.org/news/2000/10/29/us-workers-rights-are-being-abused)\--not the least of which being allowing capitalist interests to destroy the planet--you can see why so many socialists, think it is high time to declare that currently existing capitalist states have become [""destructive of these ends \[of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\]"" and that the people should exercise their ""Right... to abolish \[them\], and to institute new Government.""](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript)

(Side note: I find it really fascinating how far I was able to get with democratic norms, the rule of law, and international human rights law. I actually really didn't even need Marx (no real need for the LTV, surplus value, ""law of the tendency of the rate of profit"", etc.). 8th grade Civics did all the heavy lifting.)",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/p18aap/all_there_is_no_problem_with_taxation_but_there/,1628536478.0,p18aap
agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,[Neoliberals] Why do you hate the global poor?,"The following passages are from the UN paper [Global Capitalism, Deflation and Agrarian Crisis in Developing Countries by Utsa Paitnaik](https://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/(httpAuxPages)/D7EE58F01E903B2FC1256DD60046E504/$file/patnaik.pdf)

They describe the immense increase in extreme poverty in the developing world caused by the introduction on neoliberal economic policies in the 80s and 90s, while stating that China’s economic success is due both to its avoidance of neoliberalism and to the Maoist polices of egalitarianism and expanding basic services to the poor.

>Over the 1990s the number of people in absolute poverty (living on less than one dollar a day) in Africa is estimated to have risen from 300 to 380 million. Food security was adversely affected in the entire region: annual per head absorption of the food staples (including tubers and plantains) fell from 156 kilograms in 1980 to only 137 kilograms by the early 1990s. The richest African country, South Africa, now subscribes to neoliberal deflationism and is cutting the already low budget deficits despite a 35 per cent unemployment rate among the black majority.

>Many countries in Latin America under BWI-guided structural adjustment also saw substantial real income decline in the 1980s. Summarizing a number of IMF studies, van der Hoeven finds that, taking all countries which implemented adjustment and liberalized between 1980 and 1990, the per capita GDP declined by 9 per cent, the minimum wage fell by 31.7 per cent and the agricultural wage fell by 26.5 per cent. The absolute numbers of people in poverty taking all Latin American countries rose from 91.4 million to 132.7 million over the decade.

>In the course of the 1990s, mass income deflation became generalized to ever larger areas of the globe, while in already income-deflating areas like sub-Saharan Africa, per capita income continued to fall by 6 per cent between 1990 and 1999, raising the numbers in absolute poverty by 80 million. In the first half of the 1990s, the Soviet Union’s break-up and shock therapy to usher in market reforms under the advice of Western experts saw a catastrophic absolute collapse of GDP in Russia and Ukraine by 1996 to half the 1990 level, and a large rise in the male death rate. All other constituents of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) also saw similar orders of decline in GDP, except Georgia where GDP declined by as much as 82 per cent, and Uzbekistan, which was the best-off with a decline of only 17 per cent (table 4). This region had been a large importer of temperate foodgrains from Northern countries as well as of tropical products and both were severely affected. This was followed by the 1997 crisis of the former Asian tigers, a few years after they had fully opened their economies to speculative financial flows. These economies experienced both asset deflation and income deflation over the next three years. The collapse of those Asian tigers that were closely integrated with other economies through trade linkages has affected export incomes elsewhere, notably in Brazil; while Argentina is in acute crisis at present with loans drying up and widespread social unrest against the implementation of harsh deflationary measures by successive governments to satisfy international creditors.

>Since 1991, India too has been implementing mass income deflationary policies, though much less intensively than many other countries, because of domestic opposition from the very beginning; nevertheless, owing to their low initial incomes, the impact of these policies on the
poorer majority of the Indian population has been severe, the most important aspects being a collapse of rural employment and a massive fall in per head food grains availability. These outcomes are discussed in greater detail in the third section.

>The only large area of sovereign economic policy in the developing world is China, where “reforms” -whatever their independent merits or demerits might be-been internally determined, and not the outcome of the debt-conditional internalization of a finance-capital- driven global neoliberal agenda. As a result, they have not been mass-demand-deflating in character but rather have, until recently, been associated with high growth rates.

>In China, an even more comprehensive peasant and landless-dominated redistribution took place in which an estimated 43-45 per cent of total cultivated area passed from the monopoly landowners to the landless and land-poor, creating a highly egalitarian distribution. Co-operatives in the 1950s, and later the larger scale communes, permitted underemployed surplus labour to be mobilized on a massive scale and investment to be stepped up, especially in water management, while non-farm enterprises, and basic health and education also spread rapidly in villages mainly through decentralized, local co-operative effort, aided where necessary by supplementary central grants. Much of China’s good growth, reduction in rural poverty and excellent performance on the human development indicators can be traced to the initial egalitarian land reform and its consolidation through the decentralized units like co-operatives and the later commune system up to 1980.

I'm a firm believer that we shouldn't tackle an issue in terms of ""right vs wrong"" but ""left vs right"" in order to promote a constructive debate.

I'm here to discuss about the American people in the middle, to further understand why is America so divided, especially in politics?  

I would like to open the debate floor with this video by Dr. Richard D Wolff:

https://youtu.be/KJm2tPbTsbI

TLDR: Skip to 15:00 min and listen, this section of the video will introduce the reason for this debate. 

What is a populist? (Populism)

""No definition of populism will fully describe all populists. That’s because populism is a “thin ideology” in that it “only speaks to a very small part of a political agenda,” according to Cas Mudde, a professor at the University of Georgia and the co-author of Populism: A Very Short Introduction. An ideology like fascism involves a holistic view of how politics, the economy, and society as a whole should be ordered. Populism doesn’t; it calls for kicking out the political establishment, but it doesn’t specify what should replace it. So it’s usually paired with “thicker” left- or right-wing ideologies like socialism or nationalism.""

It seems like one radical direction of the populism is trumpism and that lead to the March of Capitol. Not all people in the  middle support this direction and thus why Trump is not re-elected. To keep the debate constructive, let's  assume the vote wasn't ""stolen or fake"". 

It seems like another direction is understanding there's a problem with the current system, that it needs to do better to address non-economic human values. It seems like some libretarian and centrist, who do not support the radical right-wing concept of trumpism, because it divides people, are instead opening up to left ideas such as more government intervention in the capitalist system to reel in the ""invisible 
hand"" and make a capitalist system, that produces further inequality, to be more fair and just for all the people under the whole American society, ie: including the American workers.

Question: What can we do? Can populism be a symptom because the current system and governance does not help solve a current ""popular"" idea that is growing? It seems like this popular idea is well accepted 
by the majority, American workers = the majority in the American society, it's the direction that is the problem.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/lff1u8/libretarian_centrist_populism_and_socialism/,1612800551.0,lff1u8

---

**Part one: What do these words mean?**

Anarchism is a spectrum of ideologies that are opposed to unjustified hierarchies. Be they political, social, economic, or any other axis of oppression that people invent. The term was coined to describe oneself politically by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ”An,” meaning without, ”Archos” meaning rulers, and ”Y” meaning... make the word sound cooler.

Capitalism is an economic system typified by these three things:

1. Private control of the means of production (that's a hierarchy).
2. Free exchange of goods and services on the market.
3. Wage labor (that's also a hierarchy).

It sucks. Anarcho-capitalism is the belief that the state should be dismantled but capitalism should somehow be *laughs* maintained. Which they think would work. They believe everyone should follow the non-aggression principle which basically means you shouldn't initiate or threaten to initiate violence against someone or their property.

**Part Two: How are these things related?**

Ancaps and real actual anarchists believe that the state is illegitimate and should be dismantled. Though they share this conclusion they both arrived at it from very different reasoning and those differences make their goals mutually exclusive. Anarchists believe the state is illegitimate because it's a hierarchy that does not meet the burden of proof required to justify its existence. They don't like, for example, how states are always doing genocides, and bowing to the needs of a slim minority of rich perverts at the expense of everyone else. Anarchist praxis tends to revolve around taking shit from rich perverts and giving it to people who need it, fighting systems designed to prevent oppressed folk from being in control of their own lives, and violating the non-aggression principle all over a Nazis' face. Ancaps believe the state is illegitimate because it interferes with the operation of the market. The state prevents Adam Smith's invisible hand from guiding us all to laissez-faire heaven, as it would definitely do if the state just got out of the way (even though the state is necessary for capitalism to function). Also, they believe that taxation is theft, and boy do they want to tell you about it. Their praxis tends to revolve around protecting property rights, and making absolutely sure that people who own shit get to keep it, even if that mad sucks for everybody else. Do you own the only well in the town? Well sucks for all those thirsty chumps! That's your property and you earned it fair and square by inheriting it from someone else who built it and maintained it with the help of all the people you now prohibited from using it. Ancaps believe that all rights derive from property rights; the reason you have a right to autonomy over your own body is because you own yourself, and you're allowed to do whatever you want with yourself, even sell yourself. I guess if you sold yourself, the money that you get wouldn't belong to you anymore because you don't belong to you... uh... ok. Following this position, their reasoning is that if property rights are not protected, no human rights are possible. So while we may share a disdain for the government anarchist and ancap ideologies are not compatible.

**Part 3:** But what if they're the real anarchists, and you're fake anarchists pretending to be anarchists but they're the real ones?

Remember Proudhon? The first person to call himself an anarchist? He was rather fond of the saying ""Property is theft."" Anarchists tend to agree, because allowing property to be owned privately inevitably results in the accumulation of property by the few at the expense of the many. That's an economic hierarchy, my dude. Hierarchies have rulers. You can't subscribe to without-rulers-ISM if you want rulers! Even if you think those rulers deserve to rule, it's still rulers, ya dingling! Ancaps are quick to assure us that, in the absence of the state, all agreements would be made between voluntary free actors, for some reason. So while it's a hierarchy it's not coercive like it is when the government wants you to vaccinate your children. Except like, if the alternative to accepting an exploitative agreement is starvation , as has been the case for most people whenever unregulated capitalism rears its ugly head, that's, y'know, a little coercive, maybe you know not all that materially distinguishable from state violence. Also, vaccinate your kids guys... it's... you're gonna get smallpox and I... like... I don't agree with with with what you say, but I will defend to my death your right not to get smallpox.

**Part 4: You sir,** u/mogsuru, **are biased.**

Yes, that's true, I don't much care for ancapism, and I do very much like anarchism, and I want to kiss Peter Kropotkin in that beautiful broom face of his. So let's hear it from Murray Rothbard... Oh god, did I.. did I say that? [Murray Rothbard is the libertarian economist who you might recognize from those Six Flags commercials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0bvgpg7yig). The dude who pretty much invented Anarcho-capitalism once said,

>""... we are not anarchists and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical.""  
>  
>[https://mises.org/library/are-libertarians-anarchists](https://mises.org/library/are-libertarians-anarchists)

Well, there it is. I agree with Murray Rothbard about something, I guess. That's pretty gross.

**Part 5: Closing statements**

I think it's fair to say I have some... misgivings about ancapism. But my objection to them being called anarchists is not simply because I disagree with them, or I don't like them. It's because their ideology is not that thing. They're more like turn-of-the-century liberals than anarchists, which is probably why they stole the word libertarian, because it sounds kind of liberally and liberal was taken... well, I mean, I guess libertarian was taken too, by anarchists, but who cares about anarchist, you can take anarchist words, nobody minds. Probably part of the reason ancaps want to co-opt the term is to get into anarchist spaces and drown us out. Our beliefs present a threat to theirs, or I guess they would if anyone took our beliefs seriously, and I find that a little galling. I don't like the idea that groups who don't like my ideas are trying to make them more difficult to talk about or conceive of by changing the meaning of words to suit their agenda. It would be Orwellian if it was being done by the state, or by smart people, but it's actually being done by supplement chugging, econ 101, anime avatars... so it's just kind of irritating.

Also, by the way, you can't have capitalism without the state because without the state and police and the military there's no way to protect property from the collective force of the working class, i.e. certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary, and maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion, which violates anarchist principles. Anarcho-capitalist concept of voluntary choice ignores constraints due to both human and non-human factors, such as the need for food and shelter, and active restriction of both used and unused resources by those enforcing property claims. For instance, if a person requires employment in order to feed and house himself, the employer-employee relationship could be considered involuntary. Another criticism is that employment is involuntary because the economic system that makes it necessary for some individuals to serve others is supported by the enforcement of coercive private property relations.

ETA: Someone mentioned that I forgot to explain what an unjustified hierarchy even is? So it's somebody having power over someone else without a good reason. For instance, people born into wealth who are in power over the working poor are higher in that hierarchy for an unjust reason. Lobbyists are another good example, as well as unfairly elected politicians. Or more broadly, any hierarchy based on physical, mental, or biological traits, such as race, gender, sexuality, disability, etc. These are unjust because power is only established or maintained through violence, coercion, and other forms of oppression. Racism, sexism, homophobia/transphobia/biphobia, ableism, etc. are all unjust hierarchies.

TL;DR All hierarchies are unjust if and only if the hierarchy involves permanent (or at least non-fluid) subordination.",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/ibym9o/why_anarchocapitalism_cant_work/,1597747205.0,ibym9o

In 1951 the Social Democratic Party, the Centre for the Study of National Problems and the group Democratic Action formed the National Liberation Party in October 12 in order to participate in the [1953 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Costa_Rican_general_election), the first election since the civil war, with Figueres as nominee and [democratic socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism) as ideology.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Party_(Costa_Rica)#cite_note-San_Jos%C3%A9_University-5) This election was very controversial as many parties were unable to participate, among others Calderon’s [Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republican_Party_(Costa_Rica)) and the Communists. Figueres won easily over the only other candidate with 60% of the votes.

An important part of this effort has been to broaden the scope for the country’s cooperatives and social enterprises, which are already strong, embracing in one way or another a fifth of the population. These institutions represent a viable alternative to the extremes of capitalism that have given rise to morally reprehensible practices, from predatory lending and market manipulation in the financial sector to tech companies’ abuse of personal data and emissions cheating in the automobile industry. They are based on building trust and cooperation, and on the belief that focusing on the welfare of their members not only enhances wellbeing, but also increases productivity.

agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,Hypothesis: The left keeps winning because the right is more skeptical in general.,"Disclaimer: I don't necessarily believe any of this sociological analysis is true but im curious how all sides respond. 

After some recent reading and contemplation, I've become interested in an idea that civilization has been moving ""left"" for several decades and that the reason for this is that the right are generally skeptical and resistant to dramatic change while the left become very attached to ideals and put their support behind any and all methods proposed to catalyze change. It seems to me that the left is categorically endorsing the slogan ""defund the police"" while even anti-police rightists are like ""whoa, what **exactly** does that even mean here and how would it have saved George Floyd exactly..."". Now don't take this as some blind defense of right wing skepticism. Right wing skepticism also includes shit like climate change, vaccines, and viral pandemics. In my opinion, this adds to the case the right wingers are just skeptical for the sake of skepticism. 

Again, I don't particularly accept this hypothesis as accurate but I do find it very interesting. I know very intelligent leftists and very intelligent rightists and anecdotally it does seem to me that rightists are very frankly generally skeptical and leftists are generally ready to go with anything that promotes any sort of progress merely for the sake of change being made, especially if the literally elite declares it to be ""science"" or ""racism"". It seems to me like once even a simple slogan becomes popular with the left, they all support it and tell us we'll worry about what it means later. It seems to me the moderate right is wondering how defunding is going to keep a cops knee off the neck of a black man who was technically ""breaking the law"" or how a social worker is going to stop an intoxicated driver from becoming violently belligerent.  

The George Floyd murder is the first time in my life I have seen even staunch conservatives who previously said shit like ""do the crime, do the time!"" and ""don't resist if you don't want trouble!"" abjectly horrified over the treatment of an actual criminal... And now the entire issue has literally just turned into whether or not you mindlessly parrot ""black lives matter"" or how many places you can paint ""defund the police"". For a good few weeks the vast majority of the country was united against the abuse of a black criminal (and I mean this as a good thing, petty criminals don't deserve murder and murderous cops should be brought to justice) and now the entire debate is over where everyone stands on reciting slogans. This should be incredibly disheartening to everyone. How did the murder of a black man in cold blood turn into a debate over hiring social workers and what we should do with statues? None of this shit is going to stop non-violent black men from being murdered in cold blood. 

I digress. 

Totally biased, totally anecdotal observation: many progressives I know seem to have the attitude ""fuck Trump let's goooooo"" and many conservatives I know seem to have the attitude ""I don't like anyone but I'm going to support whatever throws the breaks on this nebulous economic and cultural chaos"". If these dispositions are generally accurate then it would make sense that society has been moving left because the left seizes on crisis to push an overall agenda and the right is skeptical of progress for the mere sake of progress.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/heuysx/hypothesis_the_left_keeps_winning_because_the/,1592976195.0,heuysx
agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,Assuming that microcosms of society which seem to practice socialism/communism/varying kinds of markets are relevant to how that ideology would act as a state system is silly.,"This post was prompted by a recent post comparing the NFL to communism and the MLB to capitalism. Whatever the likeness is, is that supposed to be indicative of anything?

I’m sure we’ve all seen our share of communists and socialists referencing various towns/communes or tribes who use “socialist” principles to conduct their lives and organize their small societies as some sort of evidence that that ideology as a whole is successful. 

I’m sure we’ve also all seen the “the fire departments/military/police force of America are a great example of socialism in action and what it could mean for the country” kind of arguments as well. Obviously how a set of fire departments work is not indicative of how that system would work as an all encompassing set of policy. In the very least, because the fire department doesn’t show examples of a majority of what a socialist agenda would consist of, basically the only line between the two is that the fire departments are paid for by the community, which in-and-of-itself isn’t exactly enough to call it socialist anyway.

We’ve also probably all heard equivalent arguments from capitalist who can site the same kind of tribal communities for practicing barter economies and claiming that by virtue of humans “naturally” conducting themselves through bartering, that modern capitalism is the natural way to go, no questions asked.

It’s a bit harder to find example of capitalists glorifying microcosms, but only really because capitalists control the mainstream already (edit: and because capitalist markets are essentially a massively complex web of interconnected and individual-yet-dependent microcosms, so drawing the distinction is difficult when compared to societies that isolate and practice their own types of communes), but I’m sure my fellow marxists will be able to give plenty of examples of capitalists using the same silly principle to make unrealistic interpretations of their ideology’s success based on practically irrelevant scenarios.

Extrapolating those tiny situations in which a small community successfully practices one ideology or another to mean that that system would work across a huge variety of communities and meta-communities should be an obvious fallacy, as it ignores most, if not almost all, of the relevant variables that would come into play were that system to rise to be the national agenda, but I can’t read a thread in this reddit Without seeing at least one person make this kind of argument, and it’s such a pain to watch people try and make those simpletons understand how it doesn’t matter.",101,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/g9qzw9/assuming_that_microcosms_of_society_which_seem_to/,1588093262.0,g9qzw9
agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,COVID-19 can Lead to a Reinvented Socialism,"###The pandemic makes us able to rethink the order of our society. It shows us how intrusively necessary it is to reorganise the global economy after new principles, so that it isn't extradited to the mercy of market mechanisms.

*** 

The Corona pandemic has kicked off an extensive attack of ideological vira which, for long, has been on the back-burner in our society: fake news, conspiracy-theories and racism; all in full outbreak. The valid needs to put entire countries in quarantine find resonate in ideological pressure to establish clear borders and quarantine supposed enemies, who may be thought to pose threat to our identity.

Maybe it can also happen that some other of health-bringing virus will infect us. Maybe now will the idea that we _can_ organise society differently take root, that we _can_ surpass national boundaries and step into character as a community, manifestet through new forms of global solidarity and cooperation.

Some speculate that Covid-19 can topple the rule of the CCP, in the same way that the Chernobyl-disaster ushered in the beginning of the end of the USSR. Here we do however encounter a paradox. For the Corona-crisis can force us to reinvent socialism – in a new form, build on trust between humans and trust in science.

&nbsp;

**A Blow to the Heart**

In the final scene of Tarantino's _Kill Bill 2_, Beatrix kills Bill by striking him with her 'Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique' - a deadly blow, made up of 5 pokes on special areas of the body. After five steps, the heart of the victim will explode. In the movie, Bill manages to reconcile with Beatrix, before he stagger his last five steps and die.

The time that passes from the blow hits to death makes its entry is fascinating. I can have a pleasant conversation, as long as I sit down, even though I know, that when I take steps, my heart will explode.

Is the train of thought among those who speculate that COVID-19 can cause the fall of the CCP, not an anology for this? As of now, the regime sits peacefully and observes its quarantine-measures, but it is doomed to fall, in the second real change in the social order presses against the door (As an example, when the idea that, for society, trust is more important than control, spreads).

My humble opinion is far more radical: The Corona pandemic _is_ a form of social 'Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique', but it is aimed at the heart of global capitalism – as an indisputable signal that we cannot continue as we have, but will need to complete radical systematic change.

A couple of years ago, the American literary-critic Fredric Jameson noted that there was a Utopian potential to disaster movies. Global threats call forth global solidarity; our small differences become irrelevant, as we have no other option than to cooperate to find a solution. And here we stand today – in real life, not in a movie.

The point isn't that we should be excited by suffering when they further our agenda, but rather that we should reflect over the depressing circumstance, that we apparently need catastrophe before we are able to rethink the social order.

&nbsp;

**Global Solidarity**

The first vague model for a globally coordinated answer is the World Health Organisation, from where, for once, we aren't fed the usual bureaucratic prattle, but precise warnings, presented in a way that doesn't spread panic. Such organisations we should give more power.

Bernie Sanders has been ridiculed by his opponents for his plans for a universal healthcare model for the US, but isn't the lecture of Corona that there is a need for so much more? That we have to start establishing a form of global healthcare?

The day after the deputy secretary of health of Iran attempted to tone down the severity of the Corona outbreak, he sent out a statement that he himself was infected. He added: ""The virus is democratic, and it doesn't make a difference between poor and rich, heads of state and the common citizen.""

We're all in the same boat  It's hard to miss the irony in what now brings us together in global solidarity, is expressed in injunctions against close contact and to enter into isolation.

The pandemic is only one of multiple global threats. Just behind the horizon lurks drought, heat waves, massive storms, extreme weather. Against all these events the answer isn't panic either, but to establish a form of effective global coordination.

&nbsp;

**Control Ourselves**

The first illusion we have to put in the ground is the one that President Trump put words on, when he said that the epidemic would soon be over, and that we just had to wait for it to peak, after which the old normality would return.

Against this way to cheaply purchased hope, the first thing we have to acknowledge is that the threat has come to stay. Even when the first wave of the pandemic recedes, it still can return, maybe in worse and more dangerous mutated forms.

We have to expect the permanent danger for viral epidemics will influence our most elemental interaktions with each other. It will affect out bodies. We will unavoidably be more conscious about touching things that may carry infections: door handles, toilet seats, public benches, just as we will retain larger distance to each other: no more kisses, hugs and handshakes. We will maybe even be more careful about spontaneous actions: keep our fingers from our face, stop touching our noses. So it is not only the authorities that will tighten their control – we will also ourselves have to be better at controlling ourselves. Maybe only the virtual reality be seen as safe, while it will be reserved the rich, to move around freely in special protected and isolated enclaves.

&nbsp;

**Potential for Change**

Another bizarre phenomena we can observe is, that the phenomena that markets and financial capital is now seen as living entities. When you follow media, you get the impression that what we should worry about is not as much the thousands of humans who already succumbed to COVID-19, or the tens of thousands who're infected, but rather that the circumstance that 'the markets is reacts panicky'. The pandemic is truly disruptive to the markets otherwise smooth function, and now we hear that a global recession may be unavoidable. But doesn't all this carry clear proof of how intrusively necessary it is to reorganise the global economy after new principles, so that it isn't extradited to the mercy of market mechanisms?

Obviously not by returning to the communist command-economies of the past, but by developing a new form of global organisation that can control and regulate the economy, as well as limit the sovereignty of the nation-state when it is necessary. In the era of the World Wars it was possible for the nation states to do so as a consequence of higher collective necessity. Now we're headed towards a new world war, against the pandemics.

We shouldn't be afraid to note the possibly positive side effects of the pandemic. One of the symbols of the pandemic is the quarantined passagers on the large cruise-ships (It would fill me with glee if this was the death of this obscure tourism). Travels to exotic places cannot once again become a privilege for those few who can afford to fly, as it was some decades ago. The production of cars has also been severely hit by Corona, which isn't that bad again, if it then stimulates the growth of non-individual travel. The list can go on.

In a recent speech made by the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán he said: ""There are no such thing as liberals. A liberal is but a socialist with a degree.""

What if the opposite is the case?

If we name all who only care about our freedoms 'liberals', and call all those who've acknowledged that these freedoms can only be saved if we radically change the global economy 'socialists'. In that case can we today say that those we see themselves as communists are liberals with degrees – the kind of liberals who've understood why our values of freedom are under threat, and realised that they can only be saved by radical change.

Revisiting the Meidner Plan

Revisiting the Meidner Plan

Confronting the [power of capital](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/08/wealth-inequality-capital-new-york-times/) in the United States will require a plan.

We may be confident that the concentration of capital in the hands of a tiny minority represents both [the primary obstacle to economic equality](http://peoplespolicyproject.org/2017/08/05/if-we-care-about-inequality-we-must-confront-capital/) and one of the most fundamental threats to democracy in America, but without a concrete agenda capable of securing control over capital for the people, we will never succeed in overcoming these problems.

The potential benefits of public control over the 30 percent of the national income which flows to capital are immense: a society which can provide a level of comfort, security, and freedom currently unknown by most, a massive reduction in racial and gender wealth gaps, and a healthier democracy.

As such, the question of how to secure control of capital for the people must be engaged seriously, honestly, and by drawing upon the lessons of others who have tried to do so before.

In the 1970s, the Swedish Landsorganisationen (LO) blue-collar trade union confederation took it upon themselves to ask the same questions — albeit, under different national circumstances.

Sweden’s postwar welfare state had been built around [a model](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20778709) designed by LO economists Rudolf Meidner and Gösta Rehn. The model stressed Keynesian fiscal policies, centralized collective bargaining between unions and employers, low inflation, and a push for wage equalization through a “solidarity in wages” policy. Meidner summed up the principles behind this policy in 1993:

>First, equal work should be equally paid, regardless of the profitability of the firm, the size or location of the workplace. What matters is the kind and nature of work, and the skills which are needed to perform it. The second aim of the policy is the equalizing of wage differentials, but not their total elimination. Different wages should be paid for different kinds of work.

Of considerable relevance to current debates over concentration of capital is the Meidner group’s finding that

>the modern economies of the west are filled to the brim with measures against monopolies, cartels or trusts. But nonetheless, nobody denies that the direction of economic development is essentially controlled by and for owners of capital, and their interests.

It was [not sufficient](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/03/sweden-socialism-welfare-state-trade-union/) to have — as Sweden did — decades of [social-democratic government](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/02/sweden-welfare-social-democracy-socialism/), an interventionist state, and powerful labor unions. Without changing who *owns capital*, economic development would continue to favor the rich and powerful.

The Meidner Plan failed. But it is crucial for us to remember that it was a *political* failure rather than an *economic* failure. The LO took on the employers and lost, but their plan for a transition to a democratic-socialist economy lives on, and it can help to guide our own attempts to give people control over their workplaces, to reduce inequality through public ownership of capital, and to build a sustainable economic model that can end mass unemployment while keeping inflation under control.

agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,"This entire debate of “capitalism vs. socialism” is a red herring. There’s no such thing as an unfettered “free market.” All markets are regulated and have public ownership as well as private. Conservatives would like you to think their preferences = “the free market,” but it’s just not true.","Some conservatives would like you to believe that you only have a choice between one or the other, and that choosing their philosophy of regulation and ownership constitutes a “capitalist feee market.” Nothing could be further from the truth. 

Here’s an excerpt from the preface to Dean Baker’s book, which you can read in it’s entirety here: [THE CONSERVATIVE NANNY STATE
How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay Rich and Get Richer](https://deanbaker.net/images/stories/documents/cnswebbook.pdf)

>This book is written in frustration and hope. People in the United States who consider themselves progressive must be frustrated over the extent to which conservative political ideologies have managed to dominate public debate about economic policy in the last quarter century. Even when progressives have won important political battles, such as the defeat of efforts to privatize Social Security, they have done so largely without a coherent ideology; rather, this success rested on the public’s recognition that it stood to lose its retirement security with this “reform.” It also helped that the public was suspicious of the motives of the proponents of Social Security privatization. However, success in the goal-line defense of the country’s most important social program is not the same thing as a forward looking agenda.

>The key flaw in the stance that most progressives have taken on economic issues is that they have accepted a framing whereby conservatives are assumed to support market outcomes, while progressives want to rely on the government. This framing leads progressives to futilely lash out against markets, rather than examining the factors that lead to undesirable market outcomes. The market is just a tool, and in fact a very useful one. It makes no more sense to lash out against markets than to lash out against the wheel.

>The reality is that conservatives have been quite actively using the power of the government to shape market outcomes in ways that redistribute income upward. However, conservatives have been clever enough to not own up to their role in this process, pretending all along that everything is just the natural working of the market. And, progressives have been foolish enough to go along with this view.

>The frustration with this futile debate, where conservatives like markets and progressives like government, is the driving force behind this book, along with the hope that new thinking is possible. We shall see.

agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,A definitive response to socialism - why I am opposed to it,"Before we discuss what the problems of socialism are, let's start with a few assumptions:

1.  I am coming at the question of ""Capitalism versus Socialism"" from a utilitarian perspective.  Ancaps will argue that socialism violates ""inherent property rights,"" or the ""NAP"" (not a seriously considered philosophical position), and I don't care about those.  Socialists will appeal to what they perceive as inherent ""injustice"" in capitalism, and I also don't care about that, though at least this critique has at least some backing in the mainstream philosophical community.   I am only going to argue that evidence, both theoretical and empirical, demonstrates that capitalism (and by ""capitalism"" I mean anything between social democracy and libertarianism \[I do not consider anarcho-capitalism to be capitalism, because it would dissolve into Somalia very quickly - there needs to be an incentive to respect property rights\]) leads to the best utilitarian outcomes.   
2. IN GENERAL, self interest is a stronger motivator than altruism or the inherent joy of working.  There is a lot of evidence to back this up - for example, people generally emit less carbon when there is a carbon tax, showing that they value their self interest more than damage to the environment.  People donate little of their money to charity, even when they have lots of excess wealth.  Though I do agree that this applies to a lesser extent to small communities (people are tribalistic), these will not be analyzed because societies are not built off of small communities - there are 7 billion humans.  Also, the argument that capitalism inherently teaches self interest is probably also somewhat true, but human nature is much more powerful than environmental factors here - read, for example, ""The Blank Slate"" by Steven Pinker.
3. IN GENERAL, people are the best determiner of what is in their self interest.  This can obviously be corrupted by advertising and such.  But until we have AI much, much better than we do currently, the economic calculation problem applies to a certain extent.  Furthermore, regulations in capitalism can help to make sure that this principle is upheld, by banning things like misleading advertising and, when necessary, making necessary interventions (such as a sugar tax).

Assumptions 2 and 3 lead to one conclusion: that planned economies will produce at lower rates than capitalist economies.  While socialists may object to their ideas being called ""planned,"" in my understanding, production decisions under a socialist system are made by elected worker councils to most efficiently allocate goods.  These are decisions being made at the group level, and any given individual only comprises a small portion of the group.  This trend is backed up by empirical evidence.  Let's take a case study: compare China post-Deng to communist Russia.  Though communists refuse to believe the data, Russia did not grow very quickly ([https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/public/brezhnev2002.pdf](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/public/brezhnev2002.pdf)).  When they began industrializing, they grew at slower rates than industrializing capitalist economies, and when they began to mature, their growth fell off a cliff.  Compare this to China ([https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=CN](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=CN)), which grew at astronomical rates when industrializing (faster than the USSR, even pre-war), and even as a mature economy now.  We know that a lot of this growth was due to markets - specifically, Deng Xiaoping's market reforms - because other communist states that did not engage in such practices failed to grow.  Furthermore, other market reforms, such as China's induction into the WTO ([https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/06/how-did-chinas-wto-entry-affect-its-companies/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/06/how-did-chinas-wto-entry-affect-its-companies/)) resulted in increased growth.  Similarly, see Singapore's growth rate [https://tradingeconomics.com/singapore/gdp-growth](https://tradingeconomics.com/singapore/gdp-growth).  Additionally, this growth is not all going to the top - median incomes are high as well.  Broadly, as the world has liberalized, things have gotten better ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2017/11/30/why-the-world-is-getting-better-why-hardly-anyone-knows-it/#124e9ca67826](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2017/11/30/why-the-world-is-getting-better-why-hardly-anyone-knows-it/#124e9ca67826)).

&#x200B;

I have seen other critiques of capitalism, that I will address below:

1.  Capitalism leads to the proliferation of power by the wealthy, and therefore regulatory capture by the government

This critique holds true to a certain extent.  While the idea that the U.S. is an oligarchy is patently false, the views of the wealthy/donors do hold significantly more sway than any given individual's vote.  However, this problem can easily be curbed by limiting campaign contributions, and otherwise cracking down on what is functionally bribery.  Furthermore, it is not as if workers protections and taxation do not currently exist - over the last several hundred years, capitalist societies have become increasingly regulated, perhaps overly so.  This trend changed to a certain extent from roughly 1970-2000, but in the grand scheme of things, the wealthy are not solely running the show.

2.  Capitalism leads to environmental destruction.

This problem is easily addressable - most forms of environmental destruction under capitalism are a result of failure to adequately define property rights.  If you pollute, you are violating my property rights (to my own healthy body), and as such should be fined.  Cases of deforestation/extinction are harder to address in a purely capitalist framework, but can be   solved by, again, more effective regulation.  See: protected species.

3.  Capitalism leads to gross inequality

If the poor are getting richer, this should not be a problem - and they are.  Global inequality has shrunk ([https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/global-inequality.pdf](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/global-inequality.pdf)) , and extreme poverty is way down.  Even if the benchmarks used by the world bank are somewhat misleading, it is indubitable that human progress has spiked in the last 50 years or so, as countries have embraced markets.

4.  Capitalism leads to social ills/mental illness.

As with other critiques, this may be true, but there are mitigating factors.  Firstly, this is primarily the case in countries that have hyper-work cultures, like the United States and Japan. The Nordic countries, with their differing culture, maintain capitalist institutions with high rates of growth without these problems.  Furthermore, I care more about relieving poverty and progressing humanity than about stress.

agenda,CapitalismVSocialism,"Niskanen Center's ""Two Libertarians: A Dialogue"" - Lets Discuss","The Niskanen Center, a moderate-Libertarian thinktank released [this dialogue](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/two-libertarians-a-dialogue/):

>“The ideal politics of freedom is a sort of minimal state. National defense and a court system is all you really need.”

>“Cool. Nothing even close to that has ever existed, has it?”

>“I guess not. I’d say frontier America, but then you’ll just go on about state-sponsored genocide, slavery, married women not being able to own property … all that P.C. stuff.”

>“You’ve got to admit that early America is a terrible approximation of an ideal politics of freedom. If you don’t stop talking as if it sort of was, people might suspect you’re nostalgic about the golden age of patriarchal white supremacy.”

>“I don’t appreciate your smug insinuation, but I take the point. Still, it doesn’t change the fact that a minimal state is ideal, in terms of liberty. It doesn’t matter that nothing like it has ever existed. It’s still what we ought to try to be moving toward.”

>“But why so confident about the institutional contours of your ideal? I’m not so sure about the reliability of armchair political theorizing. Just look at this [libertarian freedom index](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/human-freedom-index-preliminary-report.pdf), which shows that a few of the countries with the least minimal states are among the freest places in the world. Really, they’re probably some of the freest places in human history. So what do you make of that?”

>“Freedom? Bah! Look at those tax rates!”

>“The index takes that into account. Actually, it sort of double counts them, since countries get dinged for high tax rates and for having a government that consumes a big percentage of GDP. Those aren’t exactly the same thing, but they’re kind of the same thing. The point is, Denmark is penalized big time for its super-high taxes, yet it still does just about as well as the U.S. in terms of specifically economic freedom. And it does even better on other freedoms.

>“Good luck enjoying it with the 20 percent you get to keep.”

>“I guess you think these libertarian indices aren’t worried enough about taxes. The point is that Denmark comes out so well, despite the punishing taxes, because its economy is more laissez faire than ours in a number of ways. Trade, say. Or labor markets.”

>“Well, I suppose it’s possible to have a big welfare state and a relatively small regulatory state. They don’t necessarily go together, though I think they tend to.”

>“They don’t have to go together at all. In fact, it seems that if you want a big welfare state that works, you need relatively free markets to work their magic. Doesn’t it make you wonder whether it sort of works the other way around, too?”

>“What do you mean?”

>“Like, high levels of economic freedom won’t be politically feasible unless there’s a safety net that assures people that dynamist creative destruction and whatnot isn’t going to leave them in a lurch.”

>“Look, the Danish welfare system is absolutely impossible here. I mean, it’s a tiny, homogeneous country. It’s almost too absurd to even think about. You need to get your head out of the clouds!”

>“That’s what I’m trying to say to you! I’m not the one demanding an ideal system that doesn’t even remotely resemble anything that’s ever existed.”

>“Don’t be glib. I don’t think we’ll get there overnight. Nobody does. But the ideal should guide our thinking about where we’re headed.”

>“I don’t see the point of it. I think we’ve got to start where we find ourselves.”

>“Obvious much?”

>“And where we’re starting from limits where we can go. Just listen to yourself! If contingent cultural and political constraints mean there’s no path from the American status quo to anything like a Danish-style welfare system—and I totally agree about that— isn’t it even less likely that there’s a path from here to a utopian minimal state?”

>“Well…”

>“And if there’s no path, what function is your ideal really playing?”

>“It’s a lodestar!”

>“But there’s no point setting out on a voyage to an inaccessible destination. The fact is, neither of us knows what the freest feasible political system—starting from here—looks like. I take Hayek super-seriously.”

>“As if I don’t?”

>“You think he’s a sellout.”

>“He supported a guaranteed basic income!”

>“What I mean is that, like Hayek, I believe the social world is too complicated and unpredictable to see more than one or two steps down any path. I think you believe that, too.”

>“Maybe. As a practical matter, it’s very helpful politically to pretend that everything you don’t like will definitely send us all hurtling down the road to serfdom.”

>“Haha! Right. So, we both believe in unintended consequences. Some things you think will work won’t. And some things you think won’t work will. We both want more freedom. The question is how you get a little more of it in the real world starting from here. That’s why it’s so striking that there are countries with really big governments that are also really, really free. It’s a possibility proof!”

>“God! We’re never going to be Denmark! Support for redistribution declines with the diversity of the population. Get over it!”

>“But we’ve already got a very big welfare state! It just doesn’t work adequately as a safety net. So a lot of Americans are super freaked out about their economic prospects, and that bodes ill for our economic freedom. I mean, our economic liberty score has been plummeting since 2000! And now we’ve got protectionist, anti-immigration economic nationalists making a serious run for the presidential nominations of both major parties! It’s pretty scary.”

>“Well, that’s democracy for you! Which reminds me! The countries that do the very best on economic freedom, like Hong Kong and Singapore, are the least democratic. They show that you don’t need a big welfare state to get a small regulatory state. It’s a possibility proof!”

>“Touché. So your plan for a minimal American state is to make it less democratic? How does that work? Gonna put it to a vote?”

>“Well, maybe if more people understood public choice theory…”

>“Back up a second. I’m saying that if we patched up the already existing, already very large American welfare state so that it did a better job of preventing people from falling through the cracks, that might make the zero-sum thinking of economic nationalist politicians like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders less attractive, and an agenda of economic liberalization might be more feasible.”

>“So you say.”

>“And you’re telling me that this is impossible, as a nuts-and-bolts political matter—that I’m a numbskull with my head in the clouds—because the United States is too big and multicultural to repair its welfare system.”

>“I might not put it exactly that way…”

>“Yet you’re saying that if we could figure out a way to make the U.S. more like a Singapore-style technocratic autocracy, then maybe we could have both a small regulatory state and a small welfare state.”

>“Worth considering, isn’t it?”

>“Come on! You can’t have it both ways! You can’t tell me that promoting economic liberty by patching the preexisting safety net is politically naive, and then turn right around and point to the example of Singapore or Hong Kong, which are much further away from us than Denmark, both politically and culturally. And authoritarian to boot!”

>“I don’t know why you’re so romantic about democracy. Look who’s on top of that Fraser freedom index. Anyway, I don’t think there’s an easy path to a free society. It requires laying a great deal of groundwork.”

>“Okay, so what’s your agenda? What’s the path you’re heading more or less blindly down?”

>“Have you seen my white paper explaining why just about every existing economic regulation violates the 10th Amendment? They went wild for it at the Federalist Society.”

>“Your plan is to sue the government until it makes regulation illegal?”

>“Just being realistic.”

>“You’re kidding.”

>“That’s why, incidentally, it’s so critically important that we put a Republican in the White House this fall.”

>THE END

I felt this would spark some interesting discussion.  Here is a related clip from [Niskanen's Jerry Taylor discussing this theme on Stossel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOOl8z87TeY&feature=youtu.be).",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/4a1d6p/niskanen_centers_two_libertarians_a_dialogue_lets/,1457739249.0,4a1d6p
freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,Equalityand freedom go hand in hand,"Hello everyone,

it is often said concerning the conflict between Socialism and Capitalism that it is really a battle about two values namely the value of equality (Socialism) vs freedom (Capitalism) .

But I myself do not think that is the case at all and I want to tell you why. Before I get into my points I wanna point out the following: While the term equality is seemingly unambigious the term freedom is not. It is very ambiguous and oftentimes very value-laden. I will at this moment leave it open what I specifically mean when I use the term freedom. It will become clear how I see freedom with what I am about to lay out and we can still discuss our differences when it comes to the term in the replies.

Now let me ask the following: When it comes to nations what is the major distinction that we draw between a supposedly free nation such as the United States and an unfree nation such as Saudi Arabia. One of the first things that comes up is Democracy.

Democracy the power in the hands of the people. The people themselves have the freedom todecide what political and economic system they wanna vote for whom they want to be in charge and how the entire country is run.

Now aside from the fact that it is very questionable whether this is genuinely the case in America for the freedom of Democracy to work equality is an integral part: One man one vote. Or one man two votes if you vote for different things. But in any case each man has an equal number of votes. If person A has one vote and person B has 5 then we are not dealing with a Democracy. We do not have a system of freedom but of oppression. Person B has more freedom since he has more votes but at the expense of Person A who is far less free . And if we are to truly value Democracy as a system of freedom we do want that freedom for all do we not?

Oftentimes we also hear it said that the economy is Democratic. Vegans or video game enthusiasts often argue that we must vote with our dollar or vote with our wallet and use that vote to change what producers put on the market. ""Yes I know the new Assassin's Creed sucks so we gotta vote with our wallet and not buy it that makes Ubisoft learn.""

The problem here of course is twofold let me address the point that does not scratch my overall argument first: Not buying does not necessarily send the correct signal. In case of the video game there may be a number of factors at play. Perhaps the old video game was too long and they have not gotten through with that one. Perhaps it is a matter of setting but the overall mechanics was good. Perhaps it was a matter of mechanics but the overall setting was good. And so on.

But much more importantly: If you wanna vote with your wallet then you do not have as many votes as everyone else. More importantly those with more votes can run campaigns in form of ads to manipulate the votes of others. Or the respective object you wanna vote against can be strategically placed favorably in the store. Point is: This is a rigged Democracy because the aspect of equality is compromised and therefore so is your freedom to use your wallet-vote as effectively as you could otherwise.

But let us look more closely at economics specifically at the most poor and downtrotten of society namely homeless people:

Are they free to choose their job? No because of how they look, smell and dress chances are they will be downturned every time in favor of a better dressed better looking middle class man . This is due to their inequality .

Are they free to buy wherever their necessities wherever they want? No because of their appearance they are often removed from the store they are shopping at as opposed to the middle class man enjoying this freedom . This is due to their inequality.

Are they free to move nd change their living place say from Chicago to New York? No of course not that costs money they do not have which many other more fortunate people do. This is due to their inequality.

Are they free to be normal law abiding citizens? No because oftentimes their circumstances force them into crime. Be it stealing food they need to survive be it pickpocketing, be it begging which often is criminalized as well be it sleeping at a place that they are not allowed, be it travel without pay be it dumpster diving. This is due to their inequality .

And now look at you, likely the middle class man I brought the homeless man in comparison to: You are more free than them because you are economically more equal to the rest than him are you not?

But there are people above you who have more freedoms still: The freedom to travel around the world to places that you cannot. The freedom to lobby for politics that they want which will not serve you. The freedom to shape the narrative of modern society through building think tanks and controlling the media. The freedom to buy themselves out of convictions by hiring the best lawyers money can buy.

They have more freedom than you because they are not equal to you.

Should we not want to maximize freedom for all through making the power dynamics more equal? If we do little things like give everyone housing and making sure their basic needs are met no matter what then we are all free to so much more like taking a job because we want it not because we need it. Like deciding for ourselves how we wanna balance luxury consumer goods with free time. Like pursuing our own passions for themselves and for ourselves instead of living in anxiety and having to cut them short to cover needs for mere survival.

Anyways let me know your thoughts!",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1nu8ifq/equalityand_freedom_go_hand_in_hand/,1759224102.0,1nu8ifq
freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,Can you actually have personal property whilst abolishing private property?,"TL;DR: when practically applying the distinction between private and personal property, virtually all personal property has the potential to act as private property. This requires either abolishing personal property lest it be used as private property or putting ludicrous restrictions on personal freedom lest people use personal property as private property.

One of the biggest points of contention between capitalists and [marxian] communists is the implication of abolishing private property whilst supposedly respecting personal property. 

From what I’ve gathered according to Marx and Marxists, private property is productive property, that which generates wealth and commodities (products to be sold). Personal property, though not outright defined by Marx, is for personal consumption. 

Whilst this distinction is neat in theory, I’ve found that it doesn’t work so neatly when trying to categorize actual things, especially those which are readily available day to day. Take for example art supplies which as a miniature model hobbyist I am familiar with. Would my pain brushes, paints, other tools, count as private or personal property in and of themselves? Whilst one might say simply that since hobbyism is generally for personal consumption it’s therefor personal property and thus not warranting seizure. But what if I’m not using them for personal consumption, making models for myself. What if I do as many other hobbyists do and do commissions, painting models for others in exchange for money (or otherwise goods and services in a supposedly moneyless society), they would then count as private property since I’m using it to make commodities and generate wealth for myself, even though it’s the exact same tools which I may also be using to make models for myself. 

What this implies then is that my art and hobby supplies has the potential to act as private or personal property. And this Schrödinger’s property can apply to virtually anything that one would think of being personal property. I can use my personal car to run my own little delivery service, an impromptu über eats. Even clothing, I could be using as a source of fabric to make custom clothes to sell to others. You consider something like onlyfans, or how even without the app women can still sell nudes simply being able to communicate on social media. Their phones, as a means to take pictures and send them to others in exchange for money or goods and services therefor constitutes private property. 

Since there is this problem of personal property having the potential to be used as private property, this creates a problem vis-a-vis the goal of abolishing private property. The way I see it there’s two possible solutions, either you have to essentially abolish personal property by virtue of its potential to be private property, or you have to subject people to ludicrous restrictions on their personal freedoms and what they’re allowed to do with their supposed personal property.

freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,Why Russian and Chinese bots are always spewing socialism.,"The Internet is a lovely place full of lovely people. It is also how Russia and China to directly engage with the American public and influence it. If we are honest, this influence is always socialist in nature.

""Western values of capitalism, freedom, and individuality, are a hypocritical double standard."" - Some Russian troll.

""The West only succeeded by imperialism and colonialism."" Some Chinese bot.

And while China welcomes with open arms the billionaires and their factories, tax free, it pours resources into trying to convince the American public that the rich are parasites who are exploiting them and ""stealing"" from them.

Why are they doing this? The answer, while it may be surprising, is actually quite simple. *It's because they love us!* China and Russia want America to be strong. They are trying to save us from those pesky parasites. Afterall, if America were to economically collapse and go bankrupt, then dictators would be able to invade democratic countries all over the world and take them over. China and Russia would *not* want that to happen. This is why they are aggressively spreading socialist ideas in America and Europe. They know that if America becomes a socialist country, that America will be stronger than ever (China and Russia know better than anyone how wonderful socialism is); and they also know that American values, such as freedom and capitalism, will make America weak, which will allow dictators to invade democratic countries around the world, which, as stated, people like Putin and Xi would not want to happen.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1nm50wt/why_russian_and_chinese_bots_are_always_spewing/,1758391296.0,1nm50wt
freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,A Humanist Case for Economic Democracy,"Let's start by giving capitalism its due. The strongest, most compelling argument for capitalism isn't just about efficiency or innovation, it's about **freedom**. The freedom to start a business. The freedom to choose your career. The freedom to buy what you want. The shimmering promise of the market is a vast, open space of voluntary exchange where individuals are empowered to pursue their own self-interest and, in doing so, build a better world.

This vision is powerful. It's the story we're told, and it contains a kernel of truth. The choice between an iPhone and an Android, between a thousand different brands of cereal, feels like a tangible expression of liberty.

But here is the dialectical turn, the fundamental contradiction that we rarely confront: **The very system that champions freedom in the marketplace relies on its near-total absence in the workplace.**

For 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week, for the majority of our adult lives, most of us enter a space that is the polar opposite of a free, democratic society. We enter a private dictatorship.

# The Workplace as a Command Economy

Think about your job.

* Did you elect your boss?

* Do you have freedom of speech to criticize the company’s direction without fear of being fired?

* Do you vote on how the profits you helped create are distributed?

* Do you have a say in what your company produces, who it sells to, or what its impact on the environment is?

For the overwhelming majority of people under capitalism, the answer to all of these questions is a resounding ""no."" The modern workplace is a top-down, authoritarian structure. It's a command economy in miniature, where orders flow from the C-suite to the managers to the workers, who are expected to execute, not to participate. You are a human resource, a line item on a budget, a means to an end: the maximization of profit for the owners.

This isn't a bug, it's the core feature of the system. The entire edifice of capitalist production rests on the **wage labor contract**: you trade your obedience and your productive capacity for a wage so you can survive. You are free from starvation only by agreeing to be unfree at your job.

# ""It's a Voluntary Contract!""

The most common and powerful defense is that this relationship is voluntary. ""If you don't like your boss, you can quit!""

But this confuses the choice of which master to serve with the freedom of having no master at all. You can choose your king, but you cannot choose to live in a republic. The underlying structure of subordination remains. You can quit your job at Amazon, but you will almost certainly need to find another job at Walmart, or Starbucks, or a local business, where the fundamental power dynamic is identical. The ""choice"" to quit is overshadowed by the compulsion to sell your labor to someone in order to pay rent and buy food. This is freedom in the most hollow, formalistic sense.

The incredible innovation we see (the smartphone in your hand, for example) is a testament to human ingenuity. But it was not willed into existence by a CEO. It was designed, assembled, and shipped by thousands of people engaged in complex, cooperative labor. Yet, the fruits of this collective effort are privately appropriated by a handful of owners and shareholders. The people who create the value are the last to have a say over it.

# Humanist-Libertarian Socialism

This is where a humanist, libertarian vision of socialism comes in. It is not about replacing the CEO with a state bureaucrat. That merely swaps one master for another. It is about **abolishing the master-servant relationship itself.**

The goal is to extend the democratic principles we (claim to) cherish in our political lives into our economic lives.

* **What this looks like:** Worker-owned cooperatives where every employee has a vote. Workplaces organized as democratic republics, not private tyrannies. The means of production (the factories, the software, the offices) are owned and managed collectively by the people who use them.

* **A concrete example:** Look at the Mondragon Corporation in Spain, a federation of worker cooperatives employing over 80,000 people. They are a living, breathing testament that it is possible to run complex, innovative businesses on a global scale without a traditional capitalist ownership structure. Decisions are made democratically, and the profits are shared equitably among the worker-owners.

* **The humanist goal:** This isn't just about redistributing wealth. It's about overcoming alienation. It's about restoring human dignity to labor. It's about creating a world where work is a site of self-realization, creativity, and cooperation, not of subordination and drudgery. It's about unleashing the full potential of human ingenuity that is currently stifled by top-down control and the singular, narrow-minded goal of profit maximization.

So, my question to the capitalists here is this:

**Why should our fundamental human rights to self-determination, free speech, and democratic participation be checked at the door when we clock in for work? What is your principled defense for the private, unelected, and unaccountable dictatorship of the workplace being the dominant mode of organizing human life?**",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1mqfdj7/a_humanist_case_for_economic_democracy/,1755210345.0,1mqfdj7
freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,The Reality of Socialism from a Anarcho-Capitalist perspective,"I myself identify as a Rothbardian Anarcho-Capitalist, and i though to share with you the following passage from Murray Rothbards Power and Market, so to not confuse conservative viewpoints, objectivist viewpoints and libertarian ones : We have defined ownership as the exclusive control of a
resource. It is clear, therefore, that a “planned economy” which
leaves nominal ownership in the hands of the previous private
owners, but which places the actual control and direction of
resources in the hands of the State, is as much socialism as is the
formal nationalization of property. The Nazi and Fascist
regimes were as socialist as the Communist system that nation-
alizes all productive property.
Many people refuse to identify Nazism or Fascism as
“socialism” because they confine the latter term to Marxist or
neo-Marxist proletarianism or to various “social-democratic” proposals. But economics is not concerned with the color of the
uniform or with the good or bad manners of the rulers. Nor
does it care which groups or classes are running the State in var-
ious political regimes. Neither does it matter, for economics,
whether the socialist regime chooses its rulers by elections or by
coups d’etat. Economics is concerned only with the powers of
ownership or control that the State exercises. All forms of State
planning of the whole economy are types of socialism, notwith-
standing the philosophical or esthetic viewpoints of the various
socialist camps and regardless whether they are referred to as
“rightists” or “leftists.” Socialism may be monarchical; it may be
proletarian; it may equalize fortunes; it may increase inequality.
Its essence is always the same: total coercive State dictation over
the economy.
The distance between the poles of the purely free market, on
the one hand, and total collectivism on the other, is a contin-
uum involving different “mixes” of the freedom principle and
the coercive, hegemonic principle. Any increase of governmen-
tal ownership or control, therefore, is “socialistic,” or “collec-
tivistic,” because it is a coercive intervention bringing the econ-
omy one step closer to complete socialism.
The extent of collectivism in the twentieth century is at
once under- and overestimated. On the one hand, its develop-
ment in such countries as the United States is greatly underes-
timated. Most observers neglect, for example, the importance
of the expansion of government lending. The lender is also an
entrepreneur and part owner, regardless of his legal status.
Government loans to private enterprise, therefore, or guaran-
tees of private loans, create many centers of government own-
ership. Furthermore, the total quantity of savings in the econ-
omy is not increased by government guarantees and loans, but
its specific form is changed. The free market tends to allocate
social savings to their most profitable and productive channels.
Government loans and guarantees, by contrast, divert savings
from more to less productive channels. They also prevent the success of the most efficient entrepreneurs and the weeding out
of the inefficient (who would then become simply labor factors
rather than entrepreneurs). In both these ways, therefore, gov-
ernment lending lowers the general standard of living—to say
nothing of the loss of utility inflicted on the taxpayers, who
must make these pledges good, or who supply the money to be
loaned.
On the other hand, the extent of socialism in such countries
as Soviet Russia is overrated. Those people who point to Russia
as an example of “successful” planning by the government
ignore the fact (aside from the planning difficulties constantly
encountered) that Soviet Russia and other socialist countries
cannot have full socialism because only domestic trade is social-
ized. The rest of the world still has a market of sorts. A social-
ist State, therefore, can still buy and sell on the world market
and at least vaguely approximate the rational pricing of produc-
ers’ goods by referring to the prices of factors set on the world
market. Although the errors of even this partial socialist plan-
ning are impoverishing, they are insignificant compared to what
would happen under the total calculational chaos of a world
socialist State. One Big Cartel could not calculate and therefore
could not be established on the free market. How much more
does this apply to socialism, where the State imposes its overall
monopoly by force, and where the inefficiencies of a single
State’s actions are multiplied a thousandfold.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1mie9vx/the_reality_of_socialism_from_a_anarchocapitalist/,1754412224.0,1mie9vx
freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,What am I? Not sure I can call myself a socialist anymore but I'm not sure capitalism is my thing either.,"Hi! I’d be quite keen for help in figuring out where my politics lies. I live in the UK and have always considered myself to be on the left – specifically a socialist. When I was younger I strongly disliked capitalism and had a rather unrealistic idea about human nature. I’m not sure I would call myself a socialist any more so I’m not sure what I believe in now.   

In a nutshell – if I believe in private property as a good thing (within firm limits) I can’t really be a socialist can I?   

I’ll post a list of things I do and don’t believe in, if that helps to clarify my positions:   

I believe in:  

* Human rights and freedom for individuals to do as much as possible without interference (when it does not infringe the rights of others)  
* Secularism  
* Healthcare, housing, and education to be always prioritised and funded by the state without being subject to things like market forces or profit calculations  
* Significantly high taxes for the rich (not just squeezing the poor, middle classes, and professionals) - in a very simplistic sense, billionaires shouldn't exist  
* Major police and prison reform – there is a place for them but in a way that is completely different to what they currently do  
* Constitutional democracy with strict enforced regulations against political lobbying and grifting  
* LGBTQI+ rights  
* Sex education and pro-choice  
* Feminism (not the girlboss variety)  
* Private individual property but not rampant consumerism and greed  
* Private enterprise – within limits. Human ingenuity should be encouraged independent of state control, but corporate behemoths are evil and destructive.  
* Markets – within limits. I simply don’t believe the state can manage the entire economy and workforce but neither can corporations. 
* Trade unions and major changes to the workplace    
* Open borders – with obvious safeguards  
* International cooperation via institutions like the EU and UN  
* State funding for artists, musicians, independent film etc.     

I don’t believe in/actively dislike:    

* Monarchy and aristocracy  
* Populism  
* Austerity  
* Most intellectual property laws  
* Revolution and violence in all but the most extreme circumstances  
* State religion, religious schooling, and theocracies  
* Massive bureaucracies and box ticking – whether state or corporate  
* Managerialism  
* Private ownership of land (in the sense of aristocracy and feudalism, fine if you run a farm or vineyard), water, utilities, or anything which is core to the common good  
* Tankies and Trotskyists – leftists who defend CPC, Putin, and Islamism   
* Fascism  
* Tech bros    
* Military-industrial complex   
* Tax avoidance and non-dom status  
* Crypto BS  
* Third way  
* Libertarian justifications for things like child labour

freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,Is Friedrich Hayek Confused on Government Interventions?,"I find the concept of government non-interference in the economy an [incoherent](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1f80j73/what_is_a_government_intervention/) idea. [Hayek](https://www.commentary.org/articles/david-glasner/hayek-and-the-conservatives/) agrees, at least sometimes. Or maybe he is inconsistent.

First, here he dismisses actually existing capitalism:

>""But even at this stage we have gone very far. If we are to judge the potentialities aright, it is necessary to realize that the system under which we live, choked up with attempts at partial planning and restrictionism, is almost as far from any system of capitalism which could be rationally advocated as it is different from any consistent system of planning. It is important to realize in any investigation of the possibilities of planning that it is a fallacy to suppose capitalism as it exists today is the alternative. We are certainly as far from capitalism in its pure form as we are from any system of central planning. The world of today is just interventionist chaos."" -- F. A. Hayek, *Individualism and Economic Order* (1948), p. 136.

I find the above analytically confused. It is easy to find Ludwig Von Mises just as confused on what he calls the hampered market economy.

But in *The Road to Serfdom*, he calls for extensive government programs. I do not quote [chapter 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/18tnbqf/f_a_hayek_for_social_democracy/), which is well-known, but an earlier chapter:

>""It is important not to confuse opposition against this kind of planning with a dogmatic laissez-faire attitude... In order that competition should work beneficially, a carefully thought-out legal framework is required... Where it is impossible to create the conditions necessary to make competition effective, we must resort to other methods of guiding economic activity. Economic liberalism is opposed, however, to competition being supplanted by inferior methods of coordinating individual efforts...

>The successful use of competition as the principle of social organisation precludes certain types of coercive interference with economic life, but it admits of others which sometimes may very considerably assist its work and even requires certain kinds of government action...

>... Measures merely restricting the allowed methods of production, so long as these restrictions affect all potential producers equally and are not used as an indirect way of controlling prices and quantities. Though all such controls of the methods or production impose extra costs, Le. make it necessary to use more resources to produce a given output, they may be well worth while. To prohibit the use of certain poisonous substances, or to require special precautions in their use, to limit working hours or to require certain sanitary arrangements, is fully compatible with the preservation of competition. The only question here is whether in the particular instance the advantages gained are greater than the social costs which they impose. Nor is the preservation of competition incompatible with an extensive system of social services - so long as the organisation of these services is not designed in such a way as to make competition ineffective over wide fields.

>The functioning of competition not only requires adequate organisation of certain institutions like money, markets, and channels of information - some of which can never be adequately provided by private enterprise - but it depends above all on the existence of an appropriate legal system, a legal system designed both to preserve competition and to make it operate as beneficially as possible. It is by no means sufficient that the law should recognise the principle of private property and freedom of contract; much depends on the precise definition of the right of property as applied to different things. ... Strong arguments can be advanced that serious shortcomings here, particularly with regard to the law of corporations and of patents, have not only made competition work much more badly than it might have done, but have even led to the destruction of competition in many spheres.

>Where ... it is impracticable to make the enjoyment of certain services dependent on the payment of a price, competition will not produce the services; and the price system becomes similarly ineffective when the damage caused to others by certain uses of property cannot be effectively charged to the owner of that property... Neither the provision of signposts on the roads, nor, in most circumstances, that of the roads themselves, can be paid for by every individual user. Nor can certain harmful effects of deforestation, or of some methods of farming, or of the smoke and noise of factories, be confined to the owner of the property in question or to those who are willing to submit to the damage for an agreed compensation. In such instances we must find some substitute for the regulation by the price mechanism..."" -- F. A. Hayek, *The Road to Serfdom* (1944), Chapter III

I tried to edit the above to be short, and I deleted lots of caveats. I have never read the *Reader’s Digest* version. As I recall, Hayek thought the editors of that version did a good job. I can certainly appreciate their challenge.

Are the two Hayek quotations inconsistent? I have never made it through *The Constitution of Liberty.* And I have not even tried to start, *Law, Legislation, and Liberty*. I get that, for Hayek, laws should be general statements that allow those planning for their goals to predict, to an extent, what others will do. Laws should not be written to apply to special cases and specific people.

freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,I'm going to keep simplifying it,"It seems I need to be ""more clear"" with my writing or ideas, so I'm going to try this again; and if you are still in denial to this reality, then oh my lord we really are doomed....I'm sorry if these topics aren't the topics you'd wish to discuss, but they are the only topics, and there is no need to complicate or add on to anything that doesn't need it. I'm also sorry for any spelling or grammer errors, but I have hope that you'll be able to know what I'm talking about 

I'm going to tell you first:
- what money is and the theory of where  it comes from; because I don't think many people really know that or have a vast misunderstanding of that

I will then tell you:
- how we can not understand what money is without understanding what we are, or more importantly, ""why we are""

I will then try to argue:
- that there is only one ethical solution to the challenge of ""mitigating social uncertainties through political ideologies""; a reality which can only be made clear if we accept and embrace the following realities


WHAT IS MONEY
Imagine that the whole population of the word was everyone active on this subreddit right now, and are all more-or-less stuck in the same environment together. On a basic level, we all gotta eat, right? But the food you like isn't the same as mine. Maybe, I'm in possession of your favorite food and you are of mine, so we can just barter and trade and all get what we want, simple as that.

And that really is how ""economies"", in the sense, started out; systems of getting things in our possession all for the purpose of satisfying what people want or need. This system only works if population levels are low and/or if preferences are kept relatively simple, for when you see more and more people added to the equation, with wants and needs that grow more complex and demanding, the harder and harder it becomes to manage all these wants and needs; we can acknowledge the kaleidoscope of diversity that is human preference. So, in theory, you'd need some sort of ""middle man"": a thing that all parties can agree is something they want; it doesn't even have to be of ""value"" (regarding its rarity), just something that all parties agree on.

The only purpose of money, basically, has always just been a tool to manage the differing wants and needs in a population that is too immense and diverse in their preferences to realistically uphold a barter and trade system. Don't bite my head off with this, it's theoretical. But money comes back to getting something, wanting something, and the earliest form of that we know of in a social context is trade of some sort. 

It SHOULD be noted that barter and trade can theoretically work in a situation of mass population levels, if, and only if, the things that people want don't depend on a variety of ""parts"", and are perhaps simple in their acquisition 

It's always just been a tool to manage the wants and needs of people who often can't recognize that they are better of within a society than without

WHY WE ARE THE WAY WE ARE
We're a social species, simple as that...its just how we evolved, or rather ""what it took for us to survive"". We can't survive without manipulating our environments in some way; but also, it often seems as if many of us can't survive with no social contact...we ache for it whether we want to admit it or not

In order to ""manipulate our environments to better survive"", we often have to learn how to do that from other people. You aren't just gonna walk into the woods and start a campfire without some prior knowledge of how to do that. That's the case for everyrhing in our lives, it wouldn't be here if not for some unbroken chain of learned and passed on behavior.

THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO TAKE
we live in a society *laughs like the joke teller*, so we need a system which pays recognition to the fact that none of us asked to be here, and we're all just doing what it takes to survive best: where everyone can realistically and ethically ""win"" in their own way. If you haven't already, read some of my other posts (particularly the posts with the bullet points) to get an idea of some of the things we need to consider when choosing the ideology that is needed for optimal social efficiency.

Money is not the issue, it never has been the issue. But greed, in a context where your greed comes at the expense of someone else's happiness, liberty, or even life, will never work. If you've ever wondered ""why does the world, especially a lot of Muslim majority countries, HATE the United States?"". You'll probably say, ""it's because they see the freedom we offer our people as an abomination that needs to be destroyed"" but you couldn't be further removed from the truth. As many of us already know, it's because of the prospect of making as much money you can, in some way.

I'm sure we've all heard before of a scenerio that goes a little like this: ""there was this really good thing that could have made life easier for a lot of people, but that wouldn't have made money for the people capable of initiating the adoption of that thing so it never happened"".

Modern capitalism, as it stands, is a system which prioritizes ""making as MUCH money as you can, because that's your God given right"". It's not a system which knows what money is, it's a not a system which knows what people are, it's never been a system which has prioritized the betterment of society, only the induviduial. Sounds like some Sith stuff if you ask me....

Modern capitalism doesn't recognize the importance of a collective, it wants to disregard that in the pursuit of personal freedoms among anything else; freedoms which we ALL wish to have. But some of us recognize that the ""things of our world"" don't just appear out of thin air. They are made by someone, somewhere, and will always come back to someone, somewhere, somehow

We can not deny the millions of people born into this system of ""work to get paid, pay to live, make as much as you can, forget the competition, you matter the most, no one else matters but you"" who suffer everyday in order to produce the nice things of our world: the cobalt in our phones extracted by countries too in debt to rich superpowers to EVER realistically be out of such debt, the oil which heats our homes, powers our cars, and pretty much stands as a main ingredient in many of the other ""things"".

Modern capitalism is a system of ""I want that thing now, I will take it first and then ask questions later as to how it got here. Then, I will tell people that they just aren't doing Capitalism right if they're the ones suffering under jt, because I'm too ignorant to history and the origins of our dumb species""

It's a system of greed. And the very fact that humanity exists due to collaboration and mutual betterment, means that it is a system which will always inevitably fail, unless there is a cap on how much money you can have MITIGATED by a taxation system which places taxes HEAVILY on top earners. Until, perhaps, the world finally wakes up to the reality of how our happiness (the little things so often) comes at the expense of others. It is a system of competition, not of betterment, and it is silly and untaylored to the complex simplicity of humanity.

The only solution is voting for the people who don't support it. If you support modern capitalism or this system as it stands, what you're telling me is that my bank account somehow matters more than you, which it doesn't. Humanity first, finances second.

And if this offends you, okie!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1lel9hs/im_going_to_keep_simplifying_it/,1750263385.0,1lel9hs
freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,The awnser?,"The Solution

""Super powers"", in the context of defining nations, are at the forefront of the world's problems; or at least are the primary reason for the world's problems. To understand why, we need to first understand what ""power"" means.

Power can be seen as the ability to influence others through either love or fear: those who posess the greatest capacity to do onto you profound good or profound bad; whilst being able to avoid the desire of others to exercise control over any aspect of their lives, can be seen as having ""power"".

Power through love provides all the comforts of life we know: our homes and our cloths and our food, and pretty much...everything

Power through fear provides a path to undesirable circumstances if you don't do what is requested by the beholder; whomevers power you reside under.

When a governing body (a power holder) is known by all its subjects to be a system which maintains itself through fear predominantly, that governing body will eventually lose its power; unless it can continue to convince its subjects of the unfortuinate circumstances that are to be expected, lest they keep doing as is expected. 

How then can the subjects of an undesirable governing body avoid this fear?

It seems the only ethical, let alone realistic, solution is secession. 

Growing up, we were always taught (to some degree) that the importance of the ""union"" is to safeguard against people who would look upon our ""freedom"" in disgust; those who would see the liberties we offer our people as an abomination to the correct way of doing, and thus should be punished.

But it seems now that the reason the world hates our country isn't because of ""what we do"", but rather ""what it takes to do what we do"".

What it takes to heat our homes, power our machines, make our things.

What it takes to have the freedom to have these things.

So yes, in some way the world does hate our freedom.

And perhaps, the lack of caring towards ""what it takes"" among the working class is the reason it would seem as if we, the innocent people, are hated.

Though, how could we, those same innocent people, do anything to stop the power that is our benefactors, our government? 

Through understanding that they need us, we don't need them.

Yes, the prospect of ""doing our own thing"" may be frightening; though all we would need to do going into it is bear in mind a mentality of: ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it""....and really everything will be ok.

These ""super powers"" draw their super power from the lands and the resources they hold ownership over; from the people within these lands who produce the things which further solidify the ""superb"" nature of their power; the technology.

In the United States alone, our primary regions of innovation and production exist in the form of the West Coast and New England, both of which being highly left leaning areas, both of which being significant players in the economic and technological sectors.

These regions, furthermore, would be at a significantly greater trade advantage with the rest of the world, arguably; or at least with the local local nations in our proximity: providing safeguards against potential issues that may arise such as food supply.

A further issue which may arise is the potential supremacy of other super powers such as Russia or China in the wake of these secession movements, both of whom have shown intense disregard for human rights in pursuit of their own ideas of ""order"". 

Spreading this message, in a manor which is perhaps more relavent and understandable to the subjects of those other super powers, is the only way. The internet is a sharp tool which allows for interconnectivity on a level never before seen, a means of spreading information unlike any other

freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,"Are Newer Generations too Leftist, Lazy, and Hateful of Work?","I always see it as old people causing too much problems for younger generations. Young people are disadvantaged, they are treated as inferior, they have no generational wealth, and they have to learn skills and lessons that may take years or decades if they ever even learn.

But is it actually the fault of Leftist culture for indoctrinating young people into believing that equality, wealth, and freedom are given instead of earned through misery and sacrifice?

There is nothing wrong with current systems - every generation had to learn how to deal with hardship - the problem is that Leftism preaches that you can be feminine and weak and still be equal to stronger beings.

Leftism teaches that weakness, femininity, collectivism, and womanliness are strengths while science teaches that only the strongest and fittest survive. If you take biology - this is clearly taught, but if you take Leftist courses - the opposite is taught.

The young should always be taught that sacrifice for the greater good of lesser beings is weakness and that success can only come from the expense and exploitation of the weaker. 

Look at history - the primitive Communistic Native American tribes were easily destroyed by the exploitative Europeans, the egalitarian Turko-Mongol nomads were easily subjugated by Feudal Russia, and the feminine women respecting cultures of East and Southeast Asia got defeated by Europe, Russia, and the United States.

Cultures that are Leftist, collectivist, feministic, feminine, and loving of the weak were all killed, enslaved, and subjugated. It is tempting to believe that the weak can be equal to the strong, that a woman can be equal to a man, and that feminine love can overcome masculine strength - but reality has always proven that might makes right.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1l8itsa/are_newer_generations_too_leftist_lazy_and/,1749613325.0,1l8itsa
freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,Free Trade Requires the Freedom to Opt Out of Trade,"In his essay “Natural Order, The State, and the Immigration Problem,” the ancap theorist and crypto-fascist Hans-Herman Hoppe made the following argument: 

> Let us take one more step and assume that all property is owned privately and the entire globe is settled. Every piece of land, every house and building, every road, river, and lake, every forest and mountain, and all of the coastline is owned by private owners or firms. No such thing as “public” property or “open frontier” exists. Let us take a look at the problem of migration under this scenario of a “natural order.”

> First and foremost, in a natural order, there is no such thing as “freedom of migration.” People cannot move about as they please. Wherever a person moves, he moves on private property; and private ownership implies the owner’s right to include as well as to exclude others from his property. Essentially, a person can move only if he is invited by a recipient property owner, and this recipient-owner can revoke his invitation and expel his invitees whenever he deems their continued presence on his property undesirable (in violation of his visitation code).

Hoppe is completely correct that, in a world of fully private ownership, those of us born without ownership can go nowhere and do nothing without permission from private owners. His error is in imagining, psychopathically, that this is a good thing, and not in identifying the underlying logic of the system.

But if this is the case—and it is—then we cannot talk about *free trade* in the capitalist sense of rational actors engaging voluntarily in positive sum trade. Trade, under capitalism, cannot be considered free unless we are also free to opt out of trade. A choice made under duress through coercion or the threat of coercion by another person cannot be considered *voluntary* in the sense intrinsic to the capitalist ideal of free trade. Under capitalism, we *must* sell our labor for wages or be starved by owners whose property we seek to use and who have the power to exclude us from the means of sustenance.

If you were imprisoned, you might make the rational choice to fellate your cell mate in exchange for his protection from rival prisoners. We could imagine you had a choice of which prisoner to fellate in exchange for protection, and that both of you are better off for having made the exchange. But we would not say this choice is *voluntary*, because you made it only in the coercive context of your imprisonment. We could not think of it as voluntary in the sense that capitalist free trade demands.

Some of you might be tempted to respond to this with a claim that “work or starve” is universal to the human condition and not unique to capitalism. But this is not an argument about biological or physical facts; rather, this is an argument about human sociality. You have distant ancestors who labored productively for themselves using resources they owned in common with others; they “worked” and thus did not starve. They also didn’t sell their labor for wages, and yet still did not starve—because they did not require the permission of property owners to labor productively. (Some of you might be tempted to mistake this for an argument for primitivism, but it is not. Instead, this is merely an observation that there is no intrinsic bio-physical human need to sell our labor for wages to live, only a *social* requirement.)

Some of you might be utilitarian consequentialists, and imagine that this unfreedom is worth it because of all the wealth that results from capitalism.

Some of you might be deontological ancaps, and imagine that any consequence of legitimate property claims cannot be unjust.

And: fine, sure. I honestly don’t care. Even if you believe either, you must admit and grapple with the fundamental unfreedom that Hoppe identified: the propertyless *must* live according to the demands of property owners or be starved by those property owners.

freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,Successful Socialism,"The only real impediment to the socialist argument has always seemed to be the lack of a real world, nation state, successfully implementing socialism or turning into an authoritarian nightmare. But here I will argue that this isn't actually true, at least in a mathematical sense and to provide a blueprint for how to successfully implement a socialist society with little to no blowback.

We must recognise that socialism is not communism, so there still exists markets and business and enterprise, there is also still poverty, a la capitalism, its not perfect (yet). What we are purely focusing on is the economic reality and the math's that backs this up. 

As is the case with most great discoveries they happen by complete accident, or as a by product of something that becomes far more important than the intended goal. 

**Australian Superannuation**

First we will start with the math, socialism is oft defined as the workers owning the means of production, Australia's superannuation policy (don't worry ill explain it later) has lead to the creation of wealth for the workers of Australia, to the point that the collective wealth held in superannuation accounts is larger than the entire economy of Australia. Currently the value of these accounts is 4.2 Trillion AUD, with the Australian economy is valued at around 3 Trillion AUD. The problem that these superannuation accounts now have is that they have to seek investment abroad as they have essentially run out of things in Australia to invest in. 

What this demonstrates is that the Australian population own the means of production across their nation state. That is not to say they have full control over it, however there is a certain level of control that I will discuss later on. 

  
So what is superannuation? Basically it is a mandatory savings and investment account, it functions similar to a 401K for all the Americans reading, however all Australians are required to have an account and their employers make contributions to those funds as part of their pay package. On its inception the required rate was 3% of your wage/salary which has been incrementally increased over time, as of July 1st it will be 12%. This money is then taken by your chosen fund and invested on your behalf, which through the magic of compound interest leaves you with a good chunk of money upon your retirement, or in case of emergency, ie you are about to default on your mortgage or you need urgent medical treatment that cannot be done within the public health system. 

Of course we also need to talk about the control of the means of production and whilst this system may not provide a direct control over the MOP, it does enable the working class to control the capital input to the MOP and therefor giving the working class a good deal of power in that regard.

How that look in practice is that while you may not have access to your money, you do have control over how it is managed, this can be a simple as checking a box to prefer ""green"" investments with your chosen fund, it may be putting your money in a fund that does not invest in certain industries like gambling, tobacco, fossil fuels or weapons manufacturing or it could mean full control in what we call a self-managed superfund (SMSF). 

 **How did this come about?**

Well the simple reality is that Australia is home to the most effective workers/progressive party in the world and while they struggle to get into power, when they do they take full advantage and implement policies like super, single payer health care, social welfare, social housing etc. They have always been the party of social democracy in Australia and the results they have achieved for the Australian Worker are second to none (IMO happy to debate that). 

The architect of this scheme was Paul Keating, for all of you up over and looking for some good entertainment Keating was an absolute savage in parliament and there are hundreds of clips of him tearing absolute shreds off of the opposing party. If your looking for a place to start I highly recommend watching the ""I wana do you slowly"" clip. 

Super was introduced in Australia in 1992 and it only took about 30 years to completely upend the wealth scales of Australia. Sold as a way to combat rising pension costs in the face of an ageing population it not only solves a capitalistic problem but eventually gave the Australian worker a modicum of control over the economy. 

Of course it has seen attacks from the conservative side of government, it also acts as a tax shield for wealthier Australians, but the key here is that capitalists are always happy to dismiss utopian arguments for their ideology, why shouldn't socialists do the same? It is an imperfect solution, but its also the one that has achieved the greatest, effective push towards a socialist society that is impossible to counter with capitalist logic. 

To put in perspective the sheer size of these funds, when compared to the US, which in fairness I will combine 401ks and the social security fund for a value of 6.4T (401k) and 2.8T (social security) or 9.2T USD for a population of 330 Million, vs 3T USD for a population of 23 Million. That averages out to be 130k(USD) per Australian against 27k(USD) per American. 

 These funds make up about 25% of the entire countries net worth, the vast majority of the rest of the wealth is land, so when we look at the median wealth (more relevant than average) we see Australia as having the second highest wealth per adult, only behind Luxembourg. 

 **So where does it go from here?**

Well these funds will only continue to grow, its also worth noting that were still a decade away from truly seeing the impact of these funds as Australians who have been on the super program from the start of their career have not reached retirement age. The reality is that these funds, barring any catastrophe, will continue to grow at an exponential rate and the biggest issue that the scheme is facing is that retirees aren't drawing down on these balances enough, ie the yield of these funds are covering retirement expenses leaving the capital intact. Which will eventually be handed down to their children, creating a massive amount of generational wealth. 

It also now starts to create a closed loop in terms of profiteering, ie you go to work, get exploited for your labor, then get unexploited when the dividends are paid out to your super fund. This closed loop ends up preventing huge capital acquisition as the competition from the working class is able to outbid that of the 1%. The wages being drawn from the executive positions become the only differential between the worker and the capitalist class, and as the workers become the major shareholders of these massive corporations, the ability to control those wages is handed to the working class, therefor reducing the gap between wages, decreasing wealth inequality and reducing exploitation. 



**The Avoidance of Blowback**

The true genius of this plan is that your not actually shifting policy very far to eventually achieve your end goal. Every western economy is grappling with the reality of ageing populations and all, including the US, could be sold on similar policy. For example, Americans already pay into social security, by implementing this style of retirement fund you are actually increasing the freedom of where your money goes, a good thing, it aligns with the principles of individualism as you are taking the management of these funds away from the government, and enabling a better outcome at retirement by diversifying the investments that are being taken up. This reduces the tax burden of those that come after, again a positive. Its also a lot easier to sell people on a tax, that isn't really a tax, all the money still remains your own. 

There isn't really a capitalist argument to be made against the policy as everything else that they hold dear remains static, there's no need to redefine markets, or come up with new ways to plan an economy, no need for the installation of authoritarian government etc. 

**For the socialists:**

The one thing I see quite often coming out of the socialist argument is the obsession with billionaires, the arguments about the 1% and talking about exploitation. These arguments always lead to the same conclusions and there is generally the idea that these people must be punished (Not always expressed that way, but its always the implication), often in spite of the arguers own goals. This isn't anecdotal, its the prevailing sentiment throughout the left and it needs to die. *Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves*, this is as true as it has ever been and to continue quoting Chinese wisdom, *The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.* So beat capitalism at its own game, don't get hung up on those that are untouchable anyway, this is the way forward, its not caught up in revolution in the traditional sense but solid pragmatic thinking, planning and action. 

 **Realistic Timeframes**

The last thing I really want to get across is that these things take time, but in the grand scheme of things 30 years isn't a huge deal. Most people get caught up in the immediacy of result, and no matter your ideology, allowing your mind to fall victim to this way of thought is toxic. You really can see how this manner of thinking leads to a shit fight by looking at the US, looking at results over a single election cycle or at this point a single news cycle has completely distorted the reality of the people that live there.

freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,Three Stories About Introductory Economics,"**1. Introduction**

These events happened. Maybe in a later post, I will list some textbooks that have been written to alter the way introductory economics is taught. The United States has something called Advanced Placement (AP). AP Economics is taught for a test given in high school, which gives college credit. This is even before college.

**2. The First Textbook to Teach Keynes**

John Maynard Keynes' *General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money* was published in 1936. It contains some arguments going in cross directions.  J. R. Hicks, in the same year, offered a simplified model, the IS-LM model, which became a standard simplification.

Roy Harrod and James Meade each presented similar models at the same conference. Alvin Hansen, a Harvard economist offered another simplification. I associate Hansen with the income expenditure model, also known as the Keynesian cross. Some of Keynes' colleagues - Joan Robinson, for instance - argued these introductory models missed key points of Keynes' theory. In particular, Robinson insisted Keynes' book was set in historical time.

The details of these models do not matter for this story. The point is that here was an influential development among academic economics purportedly addressing the Great Depression. Who could write the first textbook in the United States to explain this theory at an introductory level?

[Lorie Tarshis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorie_Tarshis) was a Canadian who attended Cambridge while Keynes was working out the General Theory. He attended Keynes' annual lectures from 1932 to 1935. With others, he brought Keynes' economics to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tarshis was at Tufts. He later wrote the first introductory textbook to incorporate Keynesianism, *Elements of Economics* (Houghton Mifflin, 1947).

Initially, this textbook was successful. But then the publishers quickly started getting cancelled orders and returns. Why? Because of reactionary attacks. The boards of directors of various universities were told nonsense, publicly and privately about the book. The book from which the following comes had such an attack:

>""Marx himself, in the course of his lifetime, envisaged two broad lines of action that could be adopted to destroy the bourgeoisie: one was violent revolution; the other, a slow increase of state power, through extended social services, taxation, and regulation, to a point where a smooth transition could be effected from an individualist to a collectivist society. The Communists have come to scorn the latter method, but it is nevertheless evident that the prescience of their most systematic and inspiring philosopher has not been thereby vitiated.

>It is a revolution of the second type, one that advocates a slow but relentless transfer of power from the individual to the state, that has roots in the Department of Economics at Yale, and unquestionably in similar departments in many colleges throughout the country. The documentation that follows should paint a vivid picture."" -- William F. Buckley, Jr. *God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of Academic Freedom*, Henry Regery, 1951, p. 46-47

Buckley also attacked Samuelson's introductory textbook. Samuelson, who has said that he wrote as if he had a lawyer at his side, survived McCarthyism. And his book became the dominant introductory textbook up to the 1970s.

(For what it is worth, the 10th edition of Samuelson, in 1976, contained an appendix on the reswitching of techniques. He removed it from later editions.)

**3. An Alternative for Introductory Economics (EC 10) at Harvard**

[Stephen A. Marglin](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/6/1/stephen-a-marglin-in-1972-he/) is a tenured economist at Harvard, now emeritus I guess. EC 10 is the mainstream, introductory economics class at Harvard. In 2003, Marglin began teaching an alternative, Social Analysis 72. It began after a coalition of undergraduates, Students for Humane and Responsible Economics (SHARE), circulated a petition to teach a more pluralistic and less biased class.

Marglin wanted his class to be accepted as a prerequisite to other classes in the economics department. But how colleagues in the economics department would have [none of that](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/10/29/economics-course-ec-10/).

**4. Walkout on Mankiw's Teaching of Introductory Economics at Harvard**

Occupy Wall Street started in 2011 and grew to be an international movement.  [David Graeber](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/category/author/david-graeber), among others, helped kick off this movement.

[Occupy](https://www.goupstate.com/story/news/2011/11/28/nancy-folbre-occupy-economics/29881203007/) [Economics](https://jacobin.com/2012/02/a-comment-on-occupy-economics) was a small side-movement. Greg Mankiw has for a long time taught EC 10, the introductory class at Harvard. He also wrote the textbook, and it is widely used among other universities. As part of the Occupy Economics movement, I gather, some students organized a [walkout](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/2/mankiw-walkout-economics-10/) as a protest to the bias in Mankiw's class. If you look into this, you will, amazingly enough, find some 18-year olds saying some misguided things. But, as you might guess from the previous section, you will find some scholars agreeing with their broad point.

Mankiw sometimes seems particularly [foolish](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.27.3.21) to me.

freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,"Too many Socialists Are Historical Revisionists, and a recent case example of the History of Libertarianism Proved It","Some socialists online try to claim that the term libertarian “originally belonged to the left"", with anarchists and socialists from the French Revolution, and that various so-called ""right"" libertarians, like American libertarians, “co-opted” the term.  This claim is 100% disingenuous and ignores that the history of libertarianism comes from classical liberalism and nobody ""owns"" the term today (today, is an important context for this OP).

This claim is historical revisionism, childish, and is the all too typical purity nonsense by radicals on here. It erases the actual intellectual history of libertarian thought, which goes back ***far earlier*** than 19th-century France.

The evidence that demonstrates this false social media echo chamber narrative:

From Britannica:

>“Libertarianism, political philosophy that takes individual liberty to be the primary political value. It may be understood as a form of liberalism, classical liberalism in particular, the political philosophy associated with the English philosophers John Locke and John Stuart Mill, the Scottish economist Adam Smith, and the American statesman Thomas Jefferson.” [Source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/libertarianism)

It also notes that libertarian ideas were shaped by medieval Scholasticism, early resistance to royal absolutism, and the political battles in England and the Netherlands. The first clear libertarian manifesto came not from socialist France but from the Levelers during the English Civil Wars:

>“The first well-developed statement of libertarianism, An Agreement of the People (1647), was produced by the radical republican Leveler movement… \[and\] included the ideas of self-ownership, private property, legal equality, religious toleration, and limited, representative government.”

During the 1640s was the political populist group the Levelers, which, according to the [Encyclopedia of Libertarianism](https://ciudadanoaustral.org/biblioteca/The%20Encyclopedia%20Of%20Libertarianism%20-%20Ronald%20Hamowy.pdf), wrote the essay **""An Arrow Against All Tyrants"" (1646):**

>To every Individuall in nature, is given an individuall property by nature, not to be invaded or usurped by any: for every one as he is himselfe, so he hath a selfe propriety, else could he not be himselfe, and on this no second may presume to deprive any of, without manifest violation and affront to the very principles of nature, and of the Rules of equity and justice between man and man; mine and thine cannot be, except this be: No man hath power over my rights and liberties, and I over no mans; I may be but an Individuall, enjoy my selfe and my selfe propriety, and may write my selfe no more then my selfe, or presume any further; if I doe, I am an encroacher & an invader upon an other mans Right, to which I have no Right. For by naturall birth, all men are equally and alike borne to like propriety, liberty and freedome, and as we are delivered of God by the hand of nature into this world, every one with a naturall, innate freedome and propriety (as it were writ in the table of every mans heart, never to be obliterated) even so are we to live, every one equally and alike to enjoy his Birth-right and priviledge; even all whereof God by nature hath made him free. (p. 290)

From Wikipedia, we see that the word libertarian had multiple meanings before anarchist communists used it:

>“The first recorded use of the term libertarian was in 1789... as early as 1796, libertarian came to mean an advocate or defender of liberty, in the sense of a supporter of republicanism.” [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Etymology)

It was at this time one could argue libertarians becomes a rather distinct ideology of anti-tyranay:

>""As early as 1796, libertarian came to mean an advocate or defender of liberty, in the sense of a supporter of republicanism, when the London Packet printed on 12 February the following:
'Lately marched out of the Prison at Bristol, 450 of the French Libertarians.'

[Source: Wikipedia - Libertarianism § Etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Etymology)

The socialist use of libertaire only emerged decades later, in 1857, when Joseph Déjacque used it in a letter to Proudhon. That’s long after classical liberalism had already matured as a political tradition in England, Scotland, and America.

Libertarianism in the U.S. did not co-opt anything. It developed from a different family of traditions than the socialist use of the term. As Wikipedia puts it:

>“Modern libertarianism in the United States is a movement promoting individual liberty, especially in personal and economic affairs, advocating a limited government, and opposing the welfare state. The right-libertarianism associated with the U.S. has roots in classical liberalism, particularly of the American founding era.” (See: Brian Doherty, Radicals for Capitalism, or David Boaz, Libertarianism: A Primer)

This is what makes some socialist arguments disingenuous. They ignore or erase the deep historical roots of libertarianism in the liberal political tradition that shaped modern democracy.  Some through ignorance, but sadly many just lying by omission.

If you want to critique capitalism or libertarian ideas, do it. But stop pretending history started in 1857.

freedom,CapitalismVSocialism,"If someone tried to defend slavery to you, could you use capitalist philosophy to convince them they were wrong?","Say that you meet a business owner being served in his office by a man wearing an electric collar, boasting “I would’ve had to pay an employee $30,000 a year to work for me for a wage, but I was able to purchase this slave for a one-time sum of only $10,000!”

**You could say** ""You can't buy this man's life and labor from someone else who violently kidnapped him! Only this man himself has the right to sell his own labor.""

**But what if they said** ""You sound like a collectivist who wants to impose your personal morality onto the free market. Labor is a valuable commodity, and if acquiring labor through voluntary contracts is too costly, then a rational actor will seek a more cost-effective alternative. Why should I be forced to suffer financial losses just to satisfy some abstract notion of 'natural rights'? I’m not the one initiating coercion — how then is it immoral for me to benefit from the situation""?

**You could say** ""By that logic, if a stolen car is on sale for a cheap price, you’d have no problem buying it. But capitalism is based on the principle of legitimate property rights — property obtained through voluntary exchange, not theft or coercion. The initial act of enslaving a man is a crime, and every transaction that stems from that crime is illegitimate.""

**But what if they said** ""But slavery is legal under the current system. If you oppose that, then you’re advocating for government intervention to restrict my freedom to make voluntary market transactions. That’s no different from socialists calling for regulations on wages, prices, or wealth redistribution""?

**You could say** ""If you were enslaved tomorrow, would you accept it simply because it's 'legal'? No, because laws should be judged by whether they uphold natural rights. A system where men can be legally kidnapped, bought, and sold like cattle is not capitalism — it’s feudalism.""

**But what if they said** ""That would only be comparable had this man been born into slavery and had he been destined to die in slavery, but I on the other hand intend to free him one day — I merely need to recover my investment first""?

**You could say** ""The possibility that you might free him later doesn’t change the reality that you’re still benefiting from a crime in the present. What you’re really saying is that your financial interests take precedence over his right to freedom.""

**But what if they said** ""Isn’t that how all market transactions work? If an employee is in debt, and if I hire him for a job, then I’m not obligated to give him free money just because it would help him. He works for his wages, and in time, he can pay off his debts and earn financial independence""?

**You could say** ""The difference is that an employee agrees to the terms of his service in advance. Your slave didn’t voluntarily sign a contract — he was kidnapped and compelled through violence that violated his right to voluntary exchange.""

**But what if they said** ""You’re ignoring the reality that the world isn’t perfect. If this man had never been enslaved, then he might have starved to death — instead, he has food, shelter, and work. Sure, it’s not ideal, but I’m simply playing the hand I was dealt""?

**You could say** ""That’s the same argument that was used to justify serfdom and feudalism: ‘Well, at least the peasants have a place to live and don’t have to starve!’ But capitalism isn’t about ‘playing the hand you were dealt’ — it’s about improving the system so that free individuals control their own labor.""

**But what if they said** ""I still think the system is what it is, and I’m just making the best financial decision available to me. If you hate the system so much, then you should move to Red China, North Korea, or the Soviet Union where you can experience first-hand what your utopian theories of altruism look like in real life ""?

**You could say** “The fact that men’s lives and labor are not legally recognized by socialist dictatorships as being their own property, but are instead treated as the property of The Party, makes their system far more comparable to slavery itself. You cannot in good faith object to individuals being enslaved by the collective while defending their enslavement by other individuals.”

**But what if they said** “The difference is that a socialist collective allows no independent actors the freedom to earn property from them. In our free market system, on the other hand, you yourself could easily purchase this man from me, and then you could voluntarily choose to give him the freedom which you’ve individually decided that you want him to have. Are you going to offer me a fair market price for him so that you can do this, or are you just going to whine and complain that I refuse to do it for you? Because forcing me to provide a service for you with no compensation is slavery, and you attempting to enslave me in the name of ‘freedom’ makes you a hypocrite”?

Trump, I don't really like travelling to the US. It's a bit boring, but I confess that there are some commendable things. I like going to the Black neighborhoods of Washington, where I saw a fight in the US capital between Blacks and Latinos with barricades, which seemed like nonsense to me, because they should join together.

I confess that I like Walt Whitman and Paul Simon and Noam Chomsky and Miller.

I confess that Sacco and Vanzetti, who have my blood, are memorable in the history of the USA and I follow them. They were murdered by labor leaders in the electric chair, by the fascists who are within the USA as well as within my country.

I don't like your oil, Trump. It's going to wipe out the human species because of greed. Maybe one day, with a glass of whiskey that I accept, despite my gastritis, we can talk frankly about this, but it's difficult because you consider me part of an inferior race and I'm not, nor is any Colombian.

So, if you know someone who is stubborn, that's me, period. You can try to carry out a coup with your economic strength and your arrogance, like they did with Allende. But I will die true to my principles, I resisted torture and I resist you. I don't want slavers next in Colombia, we already had many and we freed ourselves. What I want next in Colombia are lovers of freedom. If you can't join me, I'll go elsewhere. Colombia is the heart of the world, and you didn't understand that, this is the land of the yellow butterflies, of the beauty of Remedios, but also of the colonels like Aureliano Buendía, of which I am one, perhaps the last.

You will kill me, but I will survive in my people, which lives, before yours, in the Americas. We are peoples of the winds, the mountains, the Caribbean Sea and of freedom.

You don't like our freedom, okay. I don't shake hands with White slavers. I shake hands with the White libertarian heirs of Lincoln and the Black and White farm boys of the USA, at whose graves I cried and prayed on a battlefield, which I reached after walking the mountains of Italian Tuscany and after being saved from Covid.

They are the United States, and before them I kneel, before no one else.

Overthrow me, Mr. President, and the Americas and humanity will respond.
Colombia now stops looking north, it looks at the world. Our blood comes from the blood of the Caliphate of Cordoba, the civilization of that time, of the Roman Latins of the Mediterranean, the civilization of that time, who founded the republic, democracy in Athens; our blood comes from the Black resistance fighters turned into slaves by you. Colombia is the first free territory of America, before Washington, [before] of all America, and I take refuge in its African songs.

My land is made up of goldsmiths who worked in the time of the Egyptian pharaohs and of the first artists in the world in Chiribiquete.

You will never rule us. You're opposed to the warrior who rode our lands, shouting freedom, whose name is (Simon) Bolívar.

Our people are somewhat fearful, somewhat timid, they are naive and kind, loving, but they will know how to win the Panama Canal, which you took from us with violence. Two hundred heroes from all of Latin America lie in Bocas del Toro, today's Panama, formerly Colombia, which you murdered.

I raise a flag and as (Jorge Eliecer) Gaitán said, even if it remains alone, it will continue to be raised with the Latin American dignity that is the dignity of America, which your great-grandfather did not know, and mine did, Mr. President, an immigrant in the USA.

Your blockade does not scare me, because Colombia, besides being the country of beauty, is the heart of the world. I know that you love beauty as I do, do not disrespect it and it will give its sweetness to you.

FROM TODAY ON, COLOMBIA IS OPEN TO THE ENTIRE WORLD, WITH OPEN ARMS, WE ARE BUILDERS OF FREEDOM, LIFE AND HUMANITY.

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,Is Capitalism truly the ideology of individualism?,"In the ongoing debate between capitalism and socialism, the discussion is often framed as a dialectic between individualism and collectivism—the balance between fulfilling one’s personal potential and serving the needs of society.

Under liberal capitalism, it is assumed that the pursuit of profit, private enterprise, and economic growth provides the means for individuals to achieve individuation—to discover their true self and reach their full potential. Proponents of this view, such as Jordan Peterson, argue that equality, in the negative sense, contradicts the idea of self-actualization. According to this argument, placing the collective needs above the individual stifles personal growth and the pursuit of individual excellence.

However, this ideology fails to acknowledge the ways in which capitalism can also hinder self-actualization. While the liberal argument emphasizes the individual's pursuit of self-determination, the reality is that many individuals—particularly those in marginalized positions—are systematically prevented from realizing their potential.

For example, consider individuals with physical disabilities. If the physical infrastructure around them is inaccessible, how can they ever hope to reach their true potential? In a purely laissez-faire capitalist system, the accessibility of spaces, tools, and opportunities is determined by profit. It took significant mass movements, political struggle, and state intervention to ensure basic accessibility, yet liberals often view these interventions as an infringement on individual autonomy. But what is the alternative? This is the tragedy of the commons: without regulation, society fails to ensure equal opportunity for all, and only those who can afford to navigate these barriers will thrive.

Capitalism, despite its promise of growth (e.g., GDP), fails to ensure well-being for many people. In the West, more and more people are unemployed or trapped in unsatisfactory jobs simply to survive. The economic system forces individuals into positions where they sacrifice parts of themselves daily just to make ends meet. Unhappy relationships and abusive situations are often endured because of the economic interdependency created by an inability to afford alternative living arrangements. The promise of self-actualization is undermined when the basic material conditions for personal freedom are not met.

Furthermore, capitalism’s industrial revolution marked the decline of craftsmanship, where individuals once had the freedom to express themselves and find meaning in their work. This was replaced by the mass production of goods, which, while economically efficient, offers little room for personal fulfillment. The system’s emphasis on productivity and profit instead subjected people to the private tyranny of factory work, reducing them to mere cogs in the machine, devoid of meaningful self-expression.

Capitalism, therefore, does not fulfill its own promise of individualism—even for those at the top. Those who wield economic power must suppress their personal morality in service of maximizing profit for shareholders. When we look at the recent death of Brian Thomson, we see people celebrating his murder because people are angry at the ways the private healthcare system in the US denies people so cruelly. The other side say that his murder in cold blood makes no sense as he was just doing his job, that it's just the systems fault. We don't know what was in Brian's heart. Maybe deep down he did feel a disdain for the private healthcare industry. But this is exactly what the system does. It forces us to compartmentalise the moral parts of our self in the pursuit of profit, human dignity and personal autonomy are often sacrificed. We deny our whole selves.

None of this is an endorsement of the totalitarianism often seen in statist communist regimes. Historically, totalitarian communist states—most notably the Soviet Union—have stifled individual expression under massive centralized bureaucracies. In these states, any behavior contrary to the state’s official line was violently suppressed in the name of social cohesion. George Orwell rightly warned of the dangers of such totalitarianism, which, as he argued in 1984, often spirals into oppression where ""a boot stamping on the human face forever"" becomes the norm.

The lessons from such regimes remind us that any attempt to impose a collectivist society should guard against the concentration of power and the suppression of individuality. Socialism should not equate to a bureaucratic, authoritarian state, but rather a vision that provides the conditions for all individuals to reach their full potential—regardless of race, creed, gender, or class—free from the oppression of centralized power or coercive ideologies.

I don’t know exactly what this vision of socialism would look like, but I believe it is necessary. The dichotomy between individualism and collectivism is not a zero-sum game. The societal good and individual well-being should not be mutually exclusive, and we must find a way to support both.",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1huomwd/is_capitalism_truly_the_ideology_of_individualism/,1736130984.0,1huomwd
tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,Why capitalism works and Marxism and socialism doesn't,"I feel that I have always had a decent understanding of economics that has led me to conclude that Marxism and socialism, meaning collective intervention in the free market, causes more harm than good. I want to lay out my views on them below, and ask does any socialist have a valid critique to this? I have never seen one, but if it exists perhaps someone here will enlighten me.

Marxists argue that laws protecting the rights of capitalists to own ""capital goods"" (goods which are used in the manufacture of other goods) allows them to exploit workers and take all the profit for themselves while only paying the workers the minimum amount to keep them alive and able to produce more. Supposedly, the private property system embraced by most Western countries enables those who have control of the means of production to legally take the product of their workers' labor. This fuels a race to the bottom wherein the Bourgeoisie class maximizes their profit by charging high prices and paying low wages, since the workers don't have a voice.

This argument fails to realize that capital goods are just like any other good - they can be produced, they wear out and need to be replaced, or they become obsolete. If a capitalist is making such a large profit from his capital goods then other capitalists will be incentivized to produce their own capital goods to compete. However, as capitalists begin producing more of the good, they will have a harder time finding people willing to buy the goods at such a high price, as well as people to produce the goods at such a low wage, so any incoming competitors are forced to have lower prices and higher wages. This process continues until the profit margin from the capital goods becomes so small that it no longer incentivizes people to keep producing more, i.e. when the supply of the capital goods meets the demand for them. At this point, it becomes a matter of the costs of managing the workers plus the wage the workers are willing to work for exceeds the price customers are willing to pay for the product of the workers.

This process of supply, demand, and competition is the most basic Econ 101 principle. It is the single biggest economic force and is the key to understanding how markets function. Other aspects of economics are important, but underlying it all is this, so regardless of your government's fiscal or monetary policy the bread and butter of capitalism is supply and demand. Where there is a demand, people's natural self-interest will lead them to fill in the supply. Whenever you have an opportunity to make a profit and the potential profit is large enough to incentivize you to participate in it, you will do so under the rational actor hypothesis. Therefore, if you just let people freely choose what they produce and buy and sell, you will end up at an equilibrium where no one is incentivized to change what they are buying or selling. This includes selling your own labor. This is why we say that free markets lead to the optimal outcome - it leads to an outcome where no one will willingly change what they are doing unless they can use government force on others.

If everyone was perfectly rational and all had exactly the same skill level, then everyone would get paid the same. Of course, in the real world not everyone is perfectly rational with access to perfect information and have the same skill level, this is only a model. The important point is that the process of supply and demand has negative feedback, meaning the larger the disparity between reality and the ideal if everyone was rational, the stronger the incentive to change it, and therefore any ""big"" gaps between this model and reality will resolve themselves. There is still some wiggle room for ""small"" gaps, and no one has ever denied that (except maybe the most devout market fundamentalists). In fact, there are people whose entire job is resolving disparities in markets. These are traditionally merchants and now include day-traders as well as investors who pour money into ventures that they believe will be profitable. Even if we get the government involved, there will still be ""small"" gaps because the government isn't perfect either, and if people can't find and resolve these differences even when incentivized to by the potential for profit, how can we trust the government or voters to magically know the right prices to set everything at when they are only held accountable by a slow and clunky system of democratic voting? Plus, that just opens the door to the tyranny of the majority and corruption.

Socialists often make the mistake of thinking of inequality in terms of a big ""pie"" that is divided unequally between people, but this is the zero-sum fallacy. In reality, goods are constantly being created and consumed and if you change how people are allowed to create and consume then they will change their patterns of creating and consuming. This is why saying things like ""the top x people own y% of the wealth"" is misleading, since ""wealth"" means assets, not income. Once you spend wealth, it's gone forever, and you need income to bring it back. Income inequality is a better measure, but even better than that is consumption inequality. Looking at the US census data for personal consumption expenditures, the top 1% had only 7-9% of the consumption spending in the US in the years 2017-2021. It is still disproportionate, but inequality is not necessarily bad if it means a better economy that helps everyone. Besides, I believe the rising levels of inequality in the US cannot simply be attributed to greed, because economic theory dictates that greed among many actors will lead to an equilibrium that is optimal as I described above. Some of it is due to cronyism in the government I'm sure, but it seems much more likely to me that this is due to external economic factors like globalization, wherein business owners can profit by purchasing foreign labor that currently is much cheaper that labor in the US and sell their products in wealthier countries. This will continue until competition leads to foreign countries catching up to the US in development, so while it increases inequality within countries like the US, it decreases inequality across the globe.

The best government intervention facilitates good market decision making, by giving people information, training, a social safety net to fall back on when searching for alternative employment, etc. Government can also help for things where it is genuinely more efficient for a single party to control rather than multiple competing parties, like roads, electric wires, sewers, etc. Otherwise, the effect of government intervention is just to force people to spend their money on something they otherwise wouldn't, so it affects the ""demand"" part of the supply-demand equilibrium. Redistribution forces the population at large to spend their money to support people who aren't producing what they actually want, and it dampens the incentivizing effects of profits by both decreasing the gain from productivity through taxation and increasing the appeal of being less productive by giving you free income. It messes up the whole supply-demand equilibrium, thus ensuring that people aren't getting what they want that they could have if the government stepped aside. Of course, it does benefit the lowest income earners. At this point it becomes a subjective debate on how much we are willing to take from the well off to give to the poor. If people are handicapped and unable to work or produce anything of value, basic human compassion dictates that society should help prop them up with tax dollars. But not everyone is handicapped, and if you can live comfortably off of government welfare than you have no reason to work and may work on something that isn't valuable to society, meaning other people don't want it that much. You can't just redistribute the income people are making with no effect - it will disincentivize the in-demand jobs while incentivizing the less in-demand jobs, so it will result in less income overall. In the extreme case, where all of your income is taken and distributed equally, there is no incentive to work at all and the government is forced to rely on coercive measures to force people to work. We saw this happen time and time again with the communist experiments of the 20th century. As both theory and empirical evidence supports it, I see no reason to believe that it would be any different in the future.

All that said, I believe Marxists and socialists really do have good intentions. I just think they are ignorant about how to put those good intentions into practice, instead hallucinating this enemy, ""capital,"" that does not really exist.

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,The Great Capitalist Con: Why Everything You’ve Been Told About “Freedom” Is a Lie,"# The Great Capitalist Con: Why Everything You’ve Been Told About “Freedom” Is a Lie

Here’s a little thought experiment for you: what if everything you believed about freedom, choice, and success was just a brilliantly crafted lie? What if the so-called “American Dream” was nothing more than a carrot dangled in front of your nose, keeping you on the treadmill while the real winners—the ultra-wealthy and powerful—sit back and laugh at your naivety?

Before you dismiss this as another rant against capitalism, think about it. We’ve all been fed the same story: work hard, play by the rules, and you can be anything you want to be. But let’s be honest—how’s that working out for most people? How many of us are one paycheck away from disaster, drowning in debt, or stuck in dead-end jobs that we hate?

# The “Choice” Illusion

Capitalists love to tell you that you’re free to choose. You can choose your career, your lifestyle, even your identity. But here’s the dirty secret: **none of these choices are real.** Sure, you get to pick which crappy job you’ll do, which overpriced apartment you’ll rent, or which brand of cereal you’ll buy with whatever’s left of your paycheck. But when the alternative to these choices is starvation, homelessness, or bankruptcy, is it really a choice?

Imagine you’re at a restaurant. The waiter hands you a menu with two options: eat this moldy sandwich or starve. Technically, you have a choice, right? But unless you’re a masochist, you’re going to choke down that moldy sandwich because the other option is no option at all. That’s capitalism in a nutshell. You’re “free” to make whatever choice you want, as long as it’s the one that keeps the system grinding you down.

# Upward Mobility? More Like a Ladder Greased with Bullshit

Ah, the American Dream—a tale as old as time. Work hard, and you’ll climb that socio-economic ladder straight to the top, right? Except the ladder is missing rungs, covered in grease, and leaning against a wall built with the skulls of everyone who tried and failed before you. Upward mobility in capitalism is a myth, a cruel joke to keep you playing a game you can’t win.

The rich aren’t just playing on easy mode; they’re playing a completely different game. They’ve got legacy admissions, insider networks, and a safety net so wide it doubles as a trampoline. Meanwhile, you’re out here juggling three side hustles, dodging debt collectors, and praying that one day you’ll strike it big—despite the odds stacked against you. Spoiler alert: you won’t.

# Economic Cannibalism: It’s a Buffet, and You’re the Main Course

Let’s talk about “competition,” that favorite buzzword of free-market evangelists. They’ll tell you it breeds innovation and efficiency. What they won’t tell you is that it also breeds **corporate cannibalism**. Big corporations don’t “compete” with each other; they devour each other until there’s nothing left but a handful of monopolies controlling everything from your internet provider to the brand of toothpaste you use.

Your so-called “consumer choices” are nothing but a farce. You’re not choosing between products; you’re choosing which corporate overlord you’re going to enrich this month. And don’t be fooled by that small business down the street—if they’re doing well, it’s probably because they’re a month away from being gobbled up by Amazon.

# The Planet’s on Fire, and Capitalism’s Holding the Match

The planet isn’t just an unfortunate casualty in the capitalist quest for profit—it’s the main course. Capitalism treats the Earth like an all-you-can-eat buffet with no closing time. Forests? Burn them. Oceans? Pollute them. Ice caps? Melt them. As long as profits are up, who cares if we’re on a one-way ticket to extinction?

And don’t be fooled by the “green capitalism” bullshit either. Slapping a “sustainable” label on a product made in a sweatshop and shipped across the globe isn’t saving the planet; it’s just another way to sell you more crap you don’t need. Capitalism’s solution to environmental destruction is to sell you the illusion of choice—like buying a reusable coffee cup is going to offset the billions of tons of carbon dumped into the atmosphere by the fossil fuel industry.

# Healthcare: A Game of Life or Debt

Here’s a fun fact: in a sane society, access to healthcare would be a fundamental human right. But under capitalism, it’s just another commodity to be bought and sold, like a flat-screen TV or a new car. Got cancer? Hope you’ve got a few hundred grand lying around. Can’t afford it? Too bad—guess you’ll be crowd-funding your survival on GoFundMe while pharmaceutical CEOs buy another yacht.

The entire healthcare system is built on the principle that your suffering is someone else’s profit. Insurance companies exist to find ways to deny you care while charging you for the privilege. Pharmaceuticals hike up prices because they can, and politicians, who are supposed to protect you, are too busy cashing checks from lobbyists to give a damn. In the richest country in the world, people are dying because they can’t afford insulin. But hey, at least we’re free, right?

# Education: The Great Equalizer? More Like the Great Divider

Remember when they told you education was the key to success? Yeah, turns out that was just a clever way to get you to sign up for decades of debt slavery. You’re not getting an education; you’re buying a degree, and at a price so high it makes a mafia loan shark look like a philanthropist.

Public schools are underfunded, teachers are underpaid, and college is a one-way ticket to financial ruin. The wealthy send their kids to private schools and Ivy League universities, buying them a ticket to the upper echelons of society before they’ve even hit puberty. The rest of us? We get to “choose” between a future of underpaid, overworked misery or a lifetime of debt we can never escape.

# War: Capitalism’s Favorite Business Model

War isn’t just a failure of diplomacy; it’s a business strategy. There’s a reason why there’s always enough money for bombs but not for books, enough for fighter jets but not for feeding the hungry. War is profitable, and the military-industrial complex is laughing all the way to the bank.

Every time a new conflict flares up, defense contractors get dollar signs in their eyes. It’s not about spreading democracy or fighting tyranny—it’s about securing the next billion-dollar contract. And who gets sent to fight and die in these wars? Not the sons and daughters of the wealthy, that’s for sure. It’s the poor, the desperate, the ones who have no other options because capitalism has already robbed them of everything else.

# Big Brother with a Corporate Logo

Ever get the feeling you’re being watched? That’s because you are. But it’s not the government spying on you—it’s corporations. Every click, every like, every share is logged, analyzed, and sold. Your data is the new oil, and you’re the pipeline. And guess what? You’re not getting a single cent for all that information you’re giving away for free.

The tech giants know more about you than you know about yourself. They use that data to manipulate your behavior, keep you consuming, keep you docile. They don’t need to censor you; they just need to keep feeding you a steady stream of content until you’re too numb and distracted to care about anything that really matters.

# Divide and Conquer: The Capitalist Playbook

Capitalism thrives on division. It pits us against each other along lines of race, gender, nationality, anything that will keep us from realizing that we’re all being screwed by the same system. It’s the oldest trick in the book: keep the masses fighting among themselves so they don’t turn their anger on the ones who really deserve it.

While we’re busy arguing about who gets what scraps, the rich are consolidating their power, rigging the game even further in their favor. And the worst part? We keep falling for it. Every. Single. Time.

# Mental Health Crisis: Capitalism’s Latest Casualty

Feeling depressed? Anxious? Suicidal? Join the club. We’re living in a system that measures your worth by your productivity, that dangles the specter of poverty over your head like a guillotine, and then has the gall to wonder why everyone’s breaking down.

And what’s capitalism’s solution to the mental health crisis? Sell you therapy apps, overpriced pills, and self-help books that tell you it’s your fault you’re miserable. Because clearly, the problem isn’t the dehumanizing system you’re trapped in—it’s that you’re just not meditating hard enough.

# The Myth of Meritocracy: A Fairy Tale for Suckers

The idea that you get ahead based on your talent and hard work is capitalism’s most effective scam. It convinces you to blame yourself for your failures, rather than the system designed to keep you down. The reality is, success in this world is determined by who you know, how much you inherit, and how willing you are to play the game.

The ""self-made billionaire"" is as real as the Easter Bunny. No one gets rich without exploiting others, and no one stays rich without rigging the system in their favor. Meritocracy is just the story they tell to keep you grinding away, believing that someday, if you just hustle hard enough, you’ll make it. You won’t.

# Global Exploitation: The World is Capitalism’s Sweatshop

Think capitalism only exploits people in the U.S.? Think again. The global south is capitalism’s playground, where labor laws are a joke and human rights are expendable. Sweatshops, child labor, environmental destruction—it’s all part of the plan to keep costs down and profits up.

Corporations outsource their exploitation, so you don’t have to see it. You get cheap products made by workers who are paid pennies, and the CEOs get to pat themselves on the back for their “efficiency.” It’s a global system of exploitation, and we’re all complicit in it.

# The Futility of Reform: Why Tinkering Around the Edges Won’t Save Us

Some people think we can fix capitalism with a few regulations, a kinder, gentler version of exploitation. That’s like trying to put a band-aid on a gunshot wound. The system isn’t broken; it’s functioning exactly as it’s supposed to. It was never meant to serve the many, only the few.

You can’t regulate away greed. You can’t reform a system that’s built on exploitation and inequality. We don’t need a softer, friendlier capitalism—we need to tear it down and build something better. Because the house is on fire, and no amount of tinkering with the thermostat is going to change that.

# Time to Wake Up

So here we are. The world is burning, inequality is soaring, and we’re all trapped in a system that grinds us down and calls it progress. The so-called “freedom” capitalism offers is an illusion, a trap to keep you from realizing that you’re not free at all.

It’s time to wake up. It’s time to break free. It’s time to build something better, something that values human life over profit, community over competition, sustainability over destruction.

The house is on fire, and capitalism is the arsonist. We can’t afford to keep playing by its rules, hoping for a better outcome. It’s time to flip the script, tear down the system, and create a future that’s actually worth living in.

So what’s it going to be? Stay comfortable in your chains, or fight for something real?

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,Labor Unions Versus Private Corporate Tyrannies,"[Propertarians](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/18l8dig/libertarians_think_they_are_for_freedom_but_they/) are for hierarchies. You can see this in their [attitudes](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1de9u8h/every_single_instance_of_antiunion_behavior/) to labor unions, at [least](https://www.cato.org/blog/libertarians-right-work-laws) [sometime](https://reason.com/2012/12/17/right-to-work-laws-are-indeed-libertaria/).

The enforcement of contracts is one responsibility of even a night-watchman state. But they will not enforce all contracts voluntarily entered into. For example, you cannot expect successfully sue a hitman if he does not even try after being paid. Can a contract for surrogate motherhood be [enforced](https://health.ny.gov/community/pregnancy/surrogacy/)?

So what kind of voluntary contracts are prohibited?

Suppose the leader of a labor union negotiates with the executives of a company. And they come to an agreement. All of the workers in certain job categories are to be covered by the union. The company may hire non-union members for some of these jobs, but union dues will be deducted and they will be paid by union scale. If you are hired for such a job, you might as will join the union. But laws, misleadingly named, 'right to work' laws, [prohibit](https://aflcio.org/issues/right-work) such voluntary agreements in many states in the USA.

Labor unions are important for political support of policies that benefit workers. Recently, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that voluntary agreements, as described above, are [illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_v._AFSCME) if the workers concerned are employed by the government,

As I understand it, the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 governs labor unions in the United States. Suppose labor unions want to call a [general strike](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/sorel-reflections-on-violence/political-general-strike/070F4B15E77DB6C8FF764D9BE373BAE3) to protest some political issue. Such voluntary behavior is illegal in the United States.

Suppose a union is on strike against some employer. And the members of another union want to support their fellow workers by striking against the suppliers of the employer or some of those corporations that that employer supplies. Apparently, such sympathy or secondary strikes are also illegal in the United States.

Suppose some workers are unhappy with their union representation. Perhaps they want to call a strike for their factory. Once again, such voluntary action, known as a wildcat strike, is apparently illegal in the United States.

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,Socialism is naive about human behaviour,"As a staunch capitalist, I shamelessly and unapologetically behave like a socialist among my closest friends and family. We all share among ourselves, we listen to eachother, we divide up our chores evenly, we democratize our family outings. Everybody chips in with their own abilities and everybody's needs get fairly satisfied.

Why would I do this?

Because our behaviour among closely knit clusters of people is different than our behaviour in the greater community.

I will gladly lend my car to an aunt or uncle for the weekend under no conditions, because I can trust that they will take care of it and return the car in the same state as I gave it to them. They might even fill up the gas before handing it back.

Would I do this for a complete stranger off the street? Probably not.

If times were tough one day I would, without thought, make sure the bellies of my dependants are filled before I were even to eat a crumb.

Would I do the same for a different family three streets down from me who I never met before? Probably not, and I would definitely make sure my own children are fed first.

In the household I will gladly act benevolently, while in the streets I will act with self interest.

The ideology of Socialism essentially expects us to behave on the streets as we would in our household. With benevolence, trust and willing sacrifice for the greater community. But this is a naive and flawed expectation.

Would you ever voluntarily reduce your lifestyle for the greater good? Of course not.

Would you ever voluntarily give yourself a pay cut to improve your company's bottom line? Would you even voluntarily lay yourself off? Of course not.

As a farmer during times of drought, would you hand over your grain to the community before your own children are fed? Of course not.

Don't get me wrong, it would be a beautiful thing if we all treated eachother as family. But that is nothing but an unreachable ideal unless ironically you are coerced into it by the barrel of a gun.

This flaw in the ideology is a dangerous trap. It creates the conditions for exploitation by self interested and power hungry people. This isn't a hypothetical, it's what has unfolded every single time socialism has been implemented. Any and all socialist expiriments in the past have inevitably gotten themselves hijacked by people who exploited the trap, and this pattern will always continue.

Socialists will be quick to brush it off and claim that it wasn't ""true socialism"". I got news for you. Each and every time, the founders had every intention to create ""true socialism"". And everytime the same pattern occurred. The population didn't behave as expected, more stringent authority was granted to a central power to keep society in check. And eventually that power was hijacked by a dictator disguised as a man of the people.

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,Freedom is largely an abstract buzzword,"Freedom is defined as a lack of control by others in a negative sense and the actual ability to do what you want in a positive sense. People generally like to make their own decisions. Why is this a good thing? Because it makes us happy and is good for our mental well being to direct ourselves. 

Is freedom inherently absolutely good in a negative sense? No. Nothing is inherently good. It has to promote well being. We restrict people's freedoms to kill each other, rape, enslave and all kinds of things that will harm other people's well being. 

If you are in a society you should be expected to have restrictions on your freedoms because you should have some consideration for the others in that society. You shouldn't be allowed to build a nuclear facility however you want with no regulation and end up causing a new Fukushima. That's irresponsible. You could say that's immoral.

I think the idea of freedom under capitalism is largely a guise for ""those who own the property can abuse you however they wish."" This is taken to the extremes by libertarian types. Literally anything can be done, no matter how abhorrent and a right libertarian will handwave it away by saying ""but did they put a gun to your head and force you to do it? That's freedom. Stop hating success."" As long as it's done the right way, it's freedom. Technically  they put a gun to your head for trying to use land or property.

Working every waking hour in a sweatshop, sending your kids to work, dying in fires, having no bathroom breaks or any breaks all for subsistence, being forced to give sexual favors to a slumlord for shelter. It's all just ""voluntary transactions."" All for people who have economic power over you.

 I fail to see how having one group hold the means over life and death and the ability to tyrannically wield their power over everyone else promotes anyone's well being or ""liberation"" other than the ones on top. I think most people would agree this shit taken to such extremes is pretty fucked up and immoral. You could argue how bad the imbalance of power would be in practice but why promote it at all?

I'd like a society where people have the ability to do whatever they want without taking the ability of others to do whatever they want instead of one with clearly destructive and shitty power imbalances. It might not ever be perfect but it's a worthy goal.

TLDR: freedom is a buzzword that can be and is often used as an excuse for tyranny. I'd like to live in a world where people are meaningfully FREE with my bodily autonomy and personhood from tyrannical abusive power imbalances as much as possible instead of ""voluntarily"" submitting to them. Property as a man made concept should be used to promote the development and expression of oneself instead of being used to take that power from others.",60,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/wifube/freedom_is_largely_an_abstract_buzzword/,1659879147.0,wifube
tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,Monkey Business: A shocking and grim outcome of the 1928 United Fruit Company Strike.,"Chiquita is the worlds’ largest supplier of Bananas today. Hidden behind this empire, lies one of Columbia’s worst massacres. Known today as Chiquita International, this company was originally formed as “United Fruit Company” born of a merger between Tropical Trading Transport Company and The Boston Fruit Company.

TTT was an importation company led by Minor C. Keith in Central America. The company primarily consisted of plantations and railroads. The Boston Fruit Company was also a fruit importation business which owned plantations in the West Indies as well as many steam ships. It was founded by Lorenzo Dow Baker and Andrew W. Preston. 

After the merger, they continued expansion in Latin America. One of these plantations was in Cienega, a town near Santa Marta, Colombia. November 12th, 1928, workers went on strike and refused to continue working until conditions improved. The workers made nine demands:

1. Stop the practice of hiring via sub-contractors.

2. Mandatory collective insurance.

3. Compensation for work accidents.

4. Hygienic dormitories and six-day work weeks.

5. Increase in daily pay for those who earned less than 100 pesos per month

6. Weekly wages.

7. Abolition of office stores.

8. Abolition of payment through coupons rather than money.

9. Improvement of hospital services.

The United Fruit Company refused these demands. The losses due to the strike resulted in the company retaliating. The company enlisted the help of Frank B. Kellogg, the United States Secretary of State, claiming these were communist revolutionaries. The United States stacked pressure on the Colombian government by threatening an invasion via the U.S. Marine Corps. 

This case is a great example of the complexity and horror of “neo-colonialism”, the control of states via indirect means—most often through economic, political, or cultural pressures. Not only did the United Fruit Company provide jobs, they also provided schools, hospitals, water systems, and many other needed infrastructure. The Colombian government caved to tyranny by the U.S. and Miguel Mendez, 12th president of Colombia, ended the strike December 6th, 1928 by dispatching soldiers to the town square and gunning down 200-2000 men, women, and children. This is now known as the “Banana Massacre”. 

Historical events shed light into darkness, but questions seem to always be left unanswered. Was this an example of statism showing its teeth via modern means of colonialism, is this the result of an inevitable race to the bottom under what some believe to be the limits of Capitalism and the Free Market? Perhaps a combination.

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,"[Capitalists] Countering the narrative that ""Cooperatives should just outcompete private business in the market""","  
I see this argument, which is basically ""You can already form cooperatives, you should just do that and outcompete capitalists if they're so much better, but you won't because they can't"", all the time, and it's very annoying because there is no way to give a good and brief rebuttal.

I'd like to explain in detail why this argument doesn't really make sense, then, but the short version is: cooperatives are a fundamentally different paradigm of operation compared to private business, and as such require a paradigm shift in the market in order to be competitive. The currently existing market is hostile and/or inhospitable to cooperatives for a number of reasons.

&#x200B;

Private enterprise, in the current system, has incentives and support that align very well but not perfectly with their mode of operation, goals, and what success in the market looks like and requires. Cooperatives operate with fundamentally different goals that make them ill-suited to compete in the same way.

The most direct analogy is slave/serf labor vs. wage labor. The economy and society as a whole benefits more from a system of wage labor vs. one of slave labor. But no individual slave owner is incentivized to shift to paying a wage rather than keeping slaves. Keeping the largest possible amount of profit to yourself and having a guaranteed labor force that you can treat like capital (that is, sell if you're in a tight spot and purchase again later) is great, from the slave owner's perspective; if you tried to do wage labor instead, not only would you have an incredibly difficult time competing on price with your peers, you would probably get shunned as a troublemaker trying to overturn that way of life. Other slave owner's might petition the government to censure you or otherwise make your life difficult. It's only when slavery gets outlawed/enough slaves are freed, *by government intervention*, throughout enough of the economy that a paradigm shift can take place and suddenly wage labor becomes more economical, and everyone benefits.

Economic mobility is increased, the ability for wage laborers to all be making their own decisions in the market for housing and food places more pressure and gives more opportunity for those markets when compared to mostly self-sufficient plantations and/or labor camps, and with labor-saving devices rapidly adjusting how much labor is actually needed for a given task, you only have to pay for the labor you need; you aren't as subject to large expenses and potential losses buying and selling slaves as your labor requirements fluctuate.

&#x200B;

Cooperatives are a similar paradigm shift, where instead of going from 'Labor receives bare minimum of compensation to maintain its own life'->'Labor receives compensation in accord with what it can demand on the market', we are going from 'Labor receives compensation in accord with what it can demand on the market'->'Labor is compensated for the full value that it produces'. Economic opportunity and mobility increases, busywork and do-nothing jobs are reduced while free time increases, the average person has more money to spend and more time in which to spend it, which invigorates the economy while helping place extra market pressure to ensure the highest quality products, since more people have the time and energy to be choosy with their purchases. With more free time, civic participation and experimentation/tinkering can both rise, resulting in more proficient governance with less corruption as well as more innovation (the reason aristocrats are responsible for a disproportionate number of inventions historically is that they had they had the money, educational background, and free time to fiddle about with things).

But again, this is a paradigm shift. Cooperatives can survive in the modern market, but they can never take it over - but then, that's mostly because it's not really the *goal* of a cooperative to take over the market, not the same way establishing a monopoly is a capitalist's wet dream.

&#x200B;

Vertical growth (increased productivity/efficiency/etc.) are equally useful for both types of business, but horizontal growth (increasing number of employees and locations) for a private business owner means more total revenue; he's usually going to get some fraction of that revenue all to himself, so horizontal growth is good. Even if the rising administration costs are higher than the efficiencies of scale resulting in diminished returns - those are *still* returns, at every step of the way. For a cooperative, though, more workers means more people to split revenue with; if there's efficiencies of scale or serious opportunities to be realized in the new location, then sure, it might be worth it, especially since being bigger tends to mean more security if any particular location has a bad run, spreading out those costs. But if the administrative costs are rising faster than efficiencies of scale? Why keep expanding? So they don't really have the incentives to try to reach the point of oligopoly or monopoly the way a privately owned business can. This also includes the very very common tactic of just buying out and assimilating competitors.

Alright, so horizontal growth of coops to dominate the market by getting really big might not be the answer, but what about parallel growth? What if they just dominate the market by having a lot of smaller coops that win out by raising the cost of labor (because they compensate their members better) for private business until it can no longer compete? Well, besides that being more difficult just due to more moving parts (not to mention the inherent difficulties of starting any new business!) the current system is built to favor the private business model. If you set up your coop so that people who invest in it without working don't get a say in how the business is run, they're going to be less interested in doing so, which makes it harder to get funding to get off the ground without just turning into a private business due to investor control. Private individuals who inherit a lot of money or get a favorable loan due to personal connections have no reason to try to turn that into a coop when the current system is quite happy letting them make a private business instead. Banks tend to prefer private businesses for lending. I'm not gonna posit an explanation for that beyond 'lending groups are affected by ideology as much as any of us, tend to be capitalist, ergo have no confidence in coops'. And finally, just like the progressive former slave owner faces backlash from his peers, potentially lethal, for making waves and disrupting the system they're benefitting from, labor organizers, coops, and socialist organizations face backlash, often lethal, from capital and the government for making waves and disrupting the system capital is benefitting from. Striking workers got killed by hired thugs and cops, machine-gunned in their tents, etc., and this was met with the tacit or explicit approval of other businesses, in no small part because it served as an example threat to their own employees. And that's just for employees wanting to use unions to get a better deal, not workers trying to overturn and replace an entire system through economic activity. You can see similar backlash against black folks in the United States when they tried to build up wealth to participate in capitalism in the accepted way white folks did - their wealthy towns got burned to the ground while the cops did nothing, they got targeted by lynch mobs that would often \*include\* cops, and they were refused the same easy loans and opportunities their white peers were offered. Because they were threatening the status quo of racial hierarchy.

&#x200B;

Capital has found a way to make union suppression much less overtly violent since then, of course, but for any socialist who advocates revolution, they'll tell you they have no doubt the guns would come back out as soon as any serious danger to capital power by organized labor presented itself. I don't personally advocate revolution other than self-defense against attempted imposition of tyranny - I would rather just push steadily forward democratically until the system is forced to that violence. Not because it's especially more likely to work, it's just much less likely to itself result in authoritarianism.

Basically, 'just win in the market' is an unreasonable expectation to push when the whole point of coops is that they're not trying to optimize purely for winning in the market, but for providing a service and giving their employees a good quality of life. Markets are evolutionary systems, and evolution is ugly and can result in really shitty behaviors sometimes (see: eating your offspring or preferably the offspring of others of your own species when resources are scarce, a behavior seen in many experiments with lab animals; the various animals that use rape as a standard part of mating, sometimes so violently they maim their partner; it's not hard to find more examples on your own). And for market systems, that shitty behavior is the fact that alleviating human suffering costs money. Which can be a good thing, as it means the market can provide that. But it also means things like creating a problem to be solved (convincing millions of people they probably have halitosis and everyone is lying to them about their breath not being terrible...so they'll buy your mouthwash) where there wasn't a problem before, or letting/making people suffer in order to cut costs (reducing your employees to the few you know are desperate enough that they can't afford to quit, then making them shoulder that entire increased workload without raising their compensation accordingly), or simply ignoring it if it isn't profitable (building luxury condos instead of affordable housing in the midst of a housing crisis, because they're more profitable due to rampant inequality).

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,(All) What the Hell Is Up With Modern Work Culture?,"The idea of a job is that you sell your labour to your employer for a fixed amount, and in return you spend X amount of time doing stuff they ask you to do. In theory, this is fine. I choose tasks I don't mind doing, for a price that suits me and find someone in need of a person like me.

But erm, when did that change?

Modern work culture just seems incredibly toxic. Many workplaces expect you to be very flexible and put work before your own life. Many places offer little to no training or opportunities for advancement. Most places act as if they are doing you a favour by providing a job.

Much of this seems incredibly counter to the ideals of capitalism. For example, the power a boss weilds borders on tyranny. Being able to dictate many aspects of your life, even what you do with your free time in some cases. 

There's a rising anti-work sentiment of people who've had enough of this. With good reason really, rates of pay have stagnated while productivity has increased. Advancing up the career ladder is increasingly more difficult. Rates of mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety and long term stress are skyrocketing. It seems the culture of western work might be blame?

So capitalists: do you think there's a problem with work culture these days? If so, what do we do about it?

Slavonians, Greeks, Wallachians, Arnauts, twelve millions of men, are all held in submission by one million of Turks, and up to a recent period, it appeared doubtful whether, of all these different races, the Turks were not the most competent to hold the supremacy which, in such a mixed population, could not but accrue to one of these nationalities.

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,"Socialism is the Big Lie of the twentieth century. While it promised prosperity, equality, and security, it delivered poverty, misery, and tyranny. Equality was achieved only in the sense that everyone was equal in his or her misery.","In the same way that a Ponzi scheme or chain letter initially succeeds but eventually collapses, socialism may show early signs of success. But any accomplishments quickly fade as the fundamental deficiencies of central planning emerge. It is the initial illusion of success that gives government intervention its pernicious, seductive appeal. In the long run, socialism has always proven to be a formula for tyranny and misery.

A pyramid scheme is ultimately unsustainable because it is based on faulty principles. Likewise, collectivism is unsustainable in the long run because it is a flawed theory. Socialism does not work because it is not consistent with fundamental principles of human behavior. The failure of socialism in countries around the world can be traced to one critical defect: it is a system that ignores incentives.

In a capitalist economy, incentives are of the utmost importance. Market prices, the profit-and-loss system of accounting, and private property rights provide an efficient, interrelated system of incentives to guide and direct economic behavior. Capitalism is based on the theory that incentives matter!

Under socialism, incentives either play a minimal role or are ignored totally. A centrally planned economy without market prices or profits, where property is owned by the state, is a system without an effective incentive mechanism to direct economic activity. By failing to emphasize incentives, socialism is a theory inconsistent with human nature and is therefore doomed to fail. Socialism is based on the theory that incentives don’t matter!

2. The strength of capitalism can be attributed to an incentive structure based upon the three Ps: (1) prices determined by market forces, (2) a profit-and-loss system of accounting and (3) private property rights. The failure of socialism can be traced to its neglect of these three incentive-enhancing components.

3. By their failure to foster, promote, and nurture the potential of their people through incentive-enhancing institutions, centrally planned economies deprive the human spirit of full development. Socialism fails because it kills and destroys the human spirit–just ask the people leaving Cuba in homemade rafts and boats [and those waiting in long lines today in Venezuela struggling, and often failing, to buy food].

4. The temptress of socialism is constantly luring us with the offer: “give up a little of your freedom and I will give you a little more security.” As the experience of this century has demonstrated, the bargain is tempting but never pays off. We end up losing both our freedom and our security.

Socialism will remain a constant temptation. We must be vigilant in our fight against socialism not only around the globe but also here in the United States.

The failure of socialism inspired a worldwide renaissance of freedom and liberty. For the first time in the history of the world, the day is coming very soon when a majority of the people in the world will live in free societies or societies rapidly moving toward freedom.

Capitalism will play a major role in the global revival of liberty and prosperity because it nurtures the human spirit, inspires human creativity, and promotes the spirit of enterprise. By providing a powerful system of incentives that promote thrift, hard work, and efficiency, capitalism creates wealth.

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,What is democracy for you? What democracy should be?,"Good day y'all 

Thanks to the contribution lately in the community, my focus lately has been about understanding what is Democracy. 

I noticed, the other day, the comment of ""what if the 51% do bad on the 49%""?

Define bad, bad is highly subjective, imo!

Let's open the floor with:

https://www.annenbergclassroom.org/glossary_term/majority-rule-and-minority-rights/

""Tyranny by minority over the majority is barred, but so is tyranny of the majority against minorities."" 

From my understanding, US democracy upholds ""majority rules, minority rights"" is how we understand and agree that the 51% will eclipse the minority 49%... any time, any day, any God given year as long Democracy exists. We protect the ""rights"" of the minority, we certainly do not protect ""minority rules"" as it is barred.

Another US democracy key principle is that losers must accept the democratic results. Ironically the March of the Capitol rather showed that such people couldn't accept such results. Instead of accepting, one is further discrediting democracy by calling the election stolen or faked or cancelled.

Now I would like to add the following:

The root of American democracy problem 7min video

https://youtu.be/0ySL82WbcvU 

So I ask again, what is democracy for you?

It seems like the political 2 party system, ie: putting men to ""compete"" against each other or putting ""parties"" to compete against each other, is producing issues like one party says 'I'm right"" and the other party replies with ""I'm more right than you"", then they don't want to ""cooperate"" since they are stuck in this mentality of ""righteousness"". This is only further paralyzing and stalling the ability for the government to actually get things done. Who benefits while the government is busy chasing its tail? Those who have deep pocket to influence the political sphere benefits from this. The constant bickering on how to fix inequality while nothing gets done further means time = profit and money for such ""minority group""  who have their ""minority rights"" protected. 

It's as if the main protection and right, most dearest to them, is the right of ownership through privatization.

Does democracy serve capitalism or capitalism serve democracy?

Or shouldn't democracy be about serving the people, the majority? How can democracy serve the people, the majority, when politicians are busy serving other the people, the minority, in order to gain more power, access, and influence which they are after in order to be better able at serving the majority.

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,[Marxists] Your concept of property is flawed.,"So, the distinction is that personal property is for personal use and private property is for private enterprise/commercial use or whatever.

Private property is like machines, equipment, etc...

However, this logic is incredibly flawed because there are plenty of property that can be both personal and private.

Cars, for example.

If I own a car and I drive it around the country to see famous statutes and monuments, it is personal property.

But let's say I decide to rent out my car to a guy who wants to transport people for money on the basis that I get 40% of the profit (that I can pay for expenses like gas and maintenance and the rest of the 40% goes in my pocket).

Now all of a sudden, it is being used as a capital good facilitating this incredibly small capitalist venture.

I'm pretty sure I'll be able to find guys who would do this, because there is a market demand for it.

I am of course, assuming you marxists aren't going to say the state would own all transportation and all transportation is public, because then you'd be no different than a social democrat or a soviet tankie.

I am also assuming you aren't naive and utopian enough to provide an unsubstantial answer like ""people won't need taxis or lyfts"" because that logic is retarded (it is unrealstic, even for you guys).

Plus this is just an example.

Who is going to tell me not to use my car (which was previously personal property)???

The state?

Or someone else?

Who?

Let's be honest, if the state has enough power to unanimously decide what people do with their personal property, it must be really fucking authoritarian.

People can commodity basically anything if they tried hard enough, such as they did with housing and landlords, they can even turn personal property such as houses into private property.

This system of communism would collapse almost instantly because anybody can literally turn their personal property that wasn't confiscated by the communists, into private party, which would force the communists to confiscate what was previously personal property to stop capitalism and private enterprise from eventually rising.

Only a government (if one would exist in a country transitioning to communism) with north korean levels of authoritarianism can dictate what people do with private and personal property.

To illustrate this, there are many jobs in the US and income being earned that isn't recorded, known or taxed by the US government.

This is called the shadow economy (or invisible economy) and can include underground black markets or even the neighborhood kid mowing the lawn of a customer with a lawnmower he doesn't own (cuz he is a little kid).

The government would not know the kid earned money by providing the service of lawnmowing, which is a product.

This money earned by the kid also isn't taxed or recorded/recognized by the government.

Yes, even something like a lawnmower can easily become private property if I start lending workers lawnmowers to go lawn people's gardens and I'll tell them to give me a cut of the money they receive from the customers that want their lawns mowed because I own the lawnmowers (these lawnmowers were previously my personal property).

Don't kid yourselves, you cannot enforce or stop these people without surpassing 1984 type of tyranny that it can even reach to dictate what individuals may or may not do with their personal property.

If I know that shmucks in my area need their cars washed, I can give some bloke my hose and my water tank and tell them to hose off my card and give me a cut of the fees they earned (because I own the hose and tank).

What will you do, take my hose and tank?

It's an example of incredibly tiny private property enterprises that have been converted from personal to private.

Look, a lot of shit can be commodified, among them is a lot of personal property that you will what? cease by force?

Soviet union is an example of a country trying to confiscate all private (but not personal) property and put it in the hands of the state.

This obviously didn't work as there was so much usable personal-to-private property that huge underground black markets formed under the soviet economy, even for basic products that weren't state-made at all.(This is excluding sumggled goods and is just referring to private-made goods in the USSR).

Moonshining was a thing during the prohibition, and allowed for many privately owned businesses to start forming in underground markets that the US government didn't know about.

The point is, if there is a will to be able to acquire private property (even by transforming personal property into private property), there will be a way to do so. One way or another.

The soviet economy failed to transform all private property into public property owned by the state.

By the way, black markets are markets that trade at illegal prices (to avoid the USSR that had fixed prices), not necessarily illegal goods. (For those who watch too much hollywood and think black markets are organ harvesting bases lmao)

And by the way, even ancient egypt had some people lending their tools and equipment (what can be both personal and private property) to farmers, these farmers (workers) in ancient egypt could give the lenders a cut of the product (crops or whatever).

Even ancient egypt had this.

I don't understand, would you confiscate all the gardening tools (personal property) in the world??? Because those gardening tools (personal property) can become the equipment needed in a private enterprise (private property).

Doesn't seem feasible at all.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/l9f5bu/marxists_your_concept_of_property_is_flawed/,1612108900.0,l9f5bu
tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,"[Compromise] Voluntary hierarchies aren’t authoritarian. HOWEVER, horizontal organizational structures are preferable from a libertarian standpoint all else being equal","##Classical Anarchists

The argument that capitalist hierarchies are involuntary is a valid one in my opinion, but only insofar as we’re talking about real world capitalism wherein property rights are set unilaterally by the coercive apparatus of the state upon everyone under its jurisdiction. When AnCaps and market anarchists talk about voluntary hierarchies not being authoritarian, we mean *truly* voluntary/non-coercive hierarchies that are self-imposed by all freely consenting individuals who enter into them. 

For the sake of argument, let’s use a hypothetical thought experiment in which we live in a truly voluntary society wherein laws are based on contractual agreements and the validity and enforceability of those laws depends entirely on whether they conform to contractual standards for voluntary consent. People in a given community converge on a given set of property rights that allows for the emergence of hierarchical private property (employer/employee) relations and, due to differences in both time preferences and risk tolerances, these relations do in fact emerge. Now, in such a scenario, can we *actually* refer to these hierarchies as authoritarian? 

My contention would be *no* because authoritarianism as I see it is fundamentally *coercive* in nature. In order for something to be authoritarian it requires an institution that enforces (through coercion) strict obedience to authority, but truly voluntary hierarchies are *self-imposed* restrictions on freedom, not impositions by some authority outside the will of the individual making the agreement. Any kind of enforceable agreement restricts individual freedoms to one degree or another, and this *includes* entering into a democratically managed workers co-op for example. Yet we wouldn’t then call *these* arrangements authoritarian too now would we? Of course not. 

The reason we don’t call co-ops authoritarian however *isn’t* because they’re run horizontally, but because there isn’t a coercive element that imposes the arrangement onto the individuals involved. Democratic organizations can and have been authoritarian as well if they’re not based on a unanimous consent of the governed. Rather than being a tyranny of a *minority*, involuntary democratic institutions impose a tyranny of a *majority* over individuals. If we don’t want to have either form of tyranny, we need to base our social organizations on individual consent. Within that scope of relating to one another, *neither* democratically run co-ops and communes *nor* hierarchically run capitalist enterprises can be considered authoritarian. 

##AnCaps

Now, I would like to make a concession that I think many AnCaps fail to make but should; regardless of whether or not this take on authoritarianism is valid, horizontal organizations that allow for maximized worker autonomy *are* better (**all else being equal**) from a libertarian point of view. If maximized individual liberty is one of the main values you prioritize, then I feel it’s fair to concede that a voluntary system of economic democracy and worker autonomy maximizes liberty better than a voluntary system of distributed hierarchies. The reasons for this I feel are obvious and self-evident, but I’m willing to listen with an open mind if you disagree. 

##Classical Anarchists and AnCaps

The purpose of this post is to help facilitate some level of unity between the left and right wing anarchist factions.

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,Should We Reframe the Debate?,"As I see it, the debate in this subreddit boils down to one core question: *who should have control over what?* The ""who"" which should control has two options: the **Majority** (>50%) or the **Minority** (a small group or an individual). The ""what"" who should be controlled also has the same options with some caveats, Majority (the whole organization/society) or Minority (small groups or individuals). These can realistically combine into three options: Majority rule over the Majority, Minority rule over the Majority, or Minority rule over the Minority; Majority rule over the Minority simply doesn't work logistically.

- Majority rule over the Majority is **Democracy.**
- Minority rule over the Majority is **Authoritarianism.**
- Minority rule over the Minority is **Individualism.**

Furthermore, belief that rule over the Majority is necessary at all is politically **Statism** or economically **Collectivism.** Its opposite, the scope of rule being restricted to the Minority, is still Individualism.

This can be arranged as a triangular compass of sorts, with both of the Statist ideas at the top and Individualism at the bottom. [In case you need a visual aid, here's something I found online.](https://spectatorau.imgix.net/content/uploads/2018/10/Snip20181014_16.png?auto=compress,enhance,format&crop=faces,entropy,edges&fit=crop&w=1052&h=965)

Authoritarianism is effectively the belief that an exceptional individial or small group should control everything. What you believe makes individuals exceptional may vary: maybe it's blood (Birthright Monarchy), maybe it's their popularity (Democratic Monarchy/Republic), maybe it's their intelligence/education (Aristocracy) or the amount of resources they have at their disposal (Oligarchy), maybe some other means of demonstrating merit (Meritocracy), or just how good they are at taking power to begin with (Tyranny). Politically, absolute Authoritarianism retains the same name whereas lesser versions are usually Republics of some form; economically, an Authoritarian organization would be closest to a traditional top-down business, run by a private individial or by shareholders or maybe by an Authoritarian state.

Democracy is effectively the belief that the majority should control everything. Whether you believe that majority vote should determine everything (Direct Democracy), whether the people should vote on who is exceptional enough to run things (Democratic Republic), or whether some individual represents the will of the people enough to simply have power (Leninism?), you believe that the will of the people who are involved should guide the direction of whatever is being controlled. Politically, Democracy overall retains the same name; economically, it is represented best by co-ops or similarly Socialist organizations, or a publicly owned/nationalised industry in a Democratic state.

Individualism is the belief that every individual has the inherent right to rule themselves, and has to appeal to others and gain their consent in order to have any right to influence them. Usually, this is backed by a constitution or other fundamental set of ideas that people within an individualist society generally agree is a good set of rules for interaction. People are free to organize in ways which replicate the other two ideologies, but the fundamental idea is that every individual must consent to these arrangements to be directly influenced by them. Politically, absolute Individualism is Anarchy whereas lesser versions are some form of Libertarianism (or Classical Liberalism); economically, it's best represented by freelance/contract work, though (like mentioned before) it can also take the form of a private business or a co-op.

Personally, I believe that these sorts of economic organizations can coexist without much issue, but the fundamental political idea *must remain Individualist* for these different economic organizations to coexist. Political Authoritarianism is at the whim of the authorities, and even political Democracy is still functionally a state, as an individual still has less say over their life than the majority does. And even if some form of authority is desired, [it can exist as an entity which people must explicitly consent to for it to have authority over them](https://youtu.be/jTYkdEU_B4o) (assuming that the people in question have not violated any of the more fundamental rights in said society which would then justify the initiation of violence against them regardless), as opposed to this ever-present parental figure the state currently exists as, to which consent is assumed under the poorly disguised rape apology that is ""social contract"" theory.

Authoritarianism and Democracy aren't inherently bad just because they're more collectivist. Depending on how an individual's or group's exceptional status is defined, having the exceptional in control rather than any random individual or the majority could be preferable: for example, capitalism is (ideally) meritocratic and so business owners having authority over the businesses they built through merit (or were deemed fit to run by the past owners) is a good thing. In situations where most if not all in an arrangement will be influenced by the consequences of a decision (i.e. in a club or other organization where merit or authority aren't as relevant), leaving that decision up to Democracy may be the most ideal way to handle it. My problem is when Authority or Democracy are *forced* onto a population, rather than consented to as involvement in a business is or as a vote in a voluntarily joined organization would be. Though if you can justify why that force is necessary, I'm interested in your arguments.

I think that viewing the overall economic argument and the accompanying political one through this lens --- on this triangular spectrum --- rather than the current binary would be most effective in the end. If you have any thoughts, corrections, clarifications, or additions, feel free to share them in the comments. I'll be making minor edits here and there to reflect improvements I see suggested or which I think of myself.

**EDIT:** Could ""Majority rule over the Minority"" potentially be ""Federation""? Because the Majority ultimately rules, simply over a bunch of independent Minority groups or individuals that largely self-regulate? I just don't know what some simple examples would be. Nor how Federation would be mutually exclusive from the other ideas, at least enough to be its own designation.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/kxjimh/should_we_reframe_the_debate/,1610672908.0,kxjimh

Please understand that this is not meant to tackle every single debatable point nor is it designed to teach someone about Anarcho-capitalism or any other sub-""ism"" under the umbrella of Capitalism. 

It is entry level but everything here is worth a read even if you consider yourself fairly advanced in your economic understanding. 

Each level is it's own reading list, and should be looked at independently, but they are arranged to build on each other. 

**Why Capitalism** 

This is the least economic reading list and is here for someone who simply doesn't grok how an otherwise decent person could actively support Capitalism. 

[Stubborn Attachments](https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals-ebook/dp/B07G9DFC8W/) \- This short book lays out the case for economic growth being a moral imperative. 

[Why Liberalism Works](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Liberalism-Works-Liberal-Prosperous-ebook/dp/B07YLPL3PM/) \-  This books goes beyond economics to make a case that classical liberalism is the best philosophy we have against the terrors of both tyranny & poverty

[The Market Loves You](https://www.amazon.com/Market-Loves-You-Should-Love-ebook/dp/B07S31V98B/) \- Understand the cooperation and even benevolence inherent in the market process.  

[The Invisible Heart](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Heart-Economic-Romance/dp/0262681358/) \- A work of fiction to contextualize everything in the way only fiction can.

**Fundamentals of Capitalism** 

If one understands why a pro-capitalist person thinks a free market economy is a good thing, then it becomes important to look at it pragmatically. How can Capitalism work to produce the positives a supporter thinks it produces?

[Basic Economics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L4FSSTA/) \- This book (along with it's followup [Applied Economics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JJXBV0/)) is arguably the best straight forward introduction to ""capitalist economics"".

[Knowledge & Decisions](https://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Decisions-Thomas-Sowell/dp/0465037380) \- Understanding the distribution of knowledge in society is vital to understanding why markets work and why they can't simply be replaced by voting or central planners.

[Profit & Loss](https://mises.org/library/profit-and-loss) \- While this is not a beginner level work it is also not very advanced, but it does deal with a vital and often misunderstood aspect of a Market economy. Understanding the role of profits & losses play now is vital because one can not simply wish them away, their function is going to happen under any economic order (even Socialism) with the only question being 'are we able to clearly see them and adjust or will they be hidden away?' 

[The Price of Everything](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691143358/) \- A work of fiction that helps contextualize everything but especially the important role of prices in the economy. 

**Capitalism At Street Level** 

An economy is not simply a bunch of equations and theories, it is real people engaged in specialization & trade. Understanding the mechanisms that keep things running is important whether you support Capitalism or seek to critique it. 

[Thanks A Thousand](https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Thousand-Gratitude-Journey-Books/dp/1501119923) \- A fun book that shows the vast interconnected, interdependent web that is our global economy. 

[The Box](https://www.amazon.com/Box-Shipping-Container-Smaller-Economy/dp/0691136408) \- Provides a good overview of a number of important topics related to trade, transportation, and how business & innovation actually work.

[How Business Works](https://www.amazon.com/How-Business-Works-Visually-Explained/dp/1465429794) \- The closest thing to an interesting intro to how modern business actually operates. To many people look at a business as if it were a black box of production, not understanding the vast complexities held within. 

[What Futures Markets Do](https://www.britannica.com/topic/futures) \- I have not found a good book on the topic, but this article is pretty good, but understanding the role of futures markets (as well as stock and currency markets) is vital to grasping the complexities that allow for our modern society to function.

[Business Biographies](https://www.theceolibrary.com/collection/best-business-biographies) \- There is no better way to learn how Capitalism operates at street level than to read about the people who actually 'do business.' But there is no ""perfect"" book on the subject so grab one of the books on this list that sound good (I recommend Show Dog or Empire State of Mind) and get an inside look at the messy real world.

None of these fit nicely into the above categories but are still very useful in grokking Capitalism. So this is a bit of an eclectic mix. 

[Seeing Like A State](https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Like-State-Condition-Paperbacks/dp/0300246757/) \- A paradigm shifting work on the failure of pursuing ""legibility"" and the importance of organic bottom up development of societies.

[Time Will Run Back](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Will-Back-Henry-Hazlitt-ebook/dp/B003F24IUI/) \- A fictional work on Capitalism vs Socialism. Seems fitting for this sub. 

Hopefully this reading list will prove to be valuable for anyone who just can't seem to ""grok"" the nature of Capitalism and why someone would be a supporter.

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,Still true today,"
Milton Friedman




Yesterday would have been the 103rd birthday of Milton Friedman, who was one of the most brilliant economists of the last century. In honor of Friedman, here are his 20 best quotes.

20) “A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both.”

19) “Because we live in a largely free society, we tend to forget how limited is the span of time and the part of the globe for which there has ever been anything like political freedom: the typical state of mankind is tyranny, servitude, and misery. The nineteenth century and early twentieth century in the Western world stand out as striking exceptions to the general trend of historical development. Political freedom in this instance clearly came along with the free market and the development of capitalist institutions. So also did political freedom in the golden age of Greece and in the early days of the Roman era.”

18) “It is one thing to have free immigration to jobs. It is another thing to have free immigration to welfare. And you cannot have both. If you have a welfare state, if you have a state in which every resident is promised a certain minimal level of income, or a minimum level of subsistence, regardless of whether he works or not, produces it or not. Then it really is an impossible thing.”

17) “So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear. That there is no alternative way, so far discovered, of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system.”

16) ""When everybody owns something, nobody owns it, and nobody has a direct interest in maintaining or improving its condition. That is why buildings in the Soviet Union - like public housing in the United States - look decrepit within a year or two of their construction…""

15) ""The great danger to the consumer is the monopoly - whether private or governmental. His most effective protection is free competition at home and free trade throughout the world. The consumer is protected from being exploited by one seller by the existence of another seller from whom he can buy and who is eager to sell to him. Alternative sources of supply protect the consumer far more effectively than all the Ralph Naders of the world.""

14) ""Two major arguments are offered for introducing socialized medicine in the United States: first, that medical costs are beyond the means of most Americans; second that socialization will somehow reduce costs. The second can be dismissed out of hand -- at least until someone can find some example of an activity that is conducted more economically by the government than private enterprise. As to the first, the people of the country must pay the costs one way or the other; the only question is whether they pay them directly on their own behalf, or indirectly through the mediation of government bureaucrats who will subtract a substantial slice for their own salaries and expenses.""

13) ""Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.""

12) ""The supporters of tariffs treat it as self-evident that the creation of jobs is a desirable end, in and of itself, regardless of what the persons employed do. That is clearly wrong. If all we want are jobs, we can create any number - for example, have people dig holes and then fill them up again, or perform other useless tasks. Work is sometimes its own reward. Mostly, however, it is the price we pay to get the things we want. Our real objective is not just jobs but productive jobs - jobs that will mean more goods and services to consume.""

11) ""I am in favor of cutting taxes under any circumstances and for any excuse, for any reason, whenever it's possible.""

10) ""There is all the difference in the world, however, between two kinds of assistance through government that seem superficially similar: first, 90 percent of us agreeing to impose taxes on ourselves in order to help the bottom 10 percent, and second, 80 percent voting to impose taxes on the top 10 percent to help the bottom 10 percent - William Graham Sumner's famous example of B and C decided what D shall do for A. The first may be wise or unwise, an effective or ineffective way to help the disadvantaged - but it is consistent with belief in both equality of opportunity and liberty. The second seeks equality of outcome and is entirely antithetical to liberty.""

9) ""When the United States was formed in 1776, it took 19 people on the farm to produce enough food for 20 people. So most of the people had to spend their time and efforts on growing food. Today, it's down to 1% or 2% to produce that food. Now just consider the vast amount of supposed unemployment that was produced by that. But there wasn't really any unemployment produced. What happened was that people who had formerly been tied up working in agriculture were freed by technological developments and improvements to do something else. That enabled us to have a better standard of living and a more extensive range of products.""

8) ""I want people to take thought about their condition and to recognize that the maintenance of a free society is a very difficult and complicated thing and it requires a self-denying ordinance of the most extreme kind. It requires a willingness to put up with temporary evils on the basis of the subtle and sophisticated understanding that if you step in to do something about them you not only may make them worse, you will spread your tentacles and get bad results elsewhere.""

7)“We economists don't know much, but we do know how to create a shortage. If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, for example, just pass a law that retailers can't sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound. Instantly you'll have a tomato shortage. It's the same with oil or gas.”

6) “The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care what color people are; it does not care what their religion is; it only cares whether they can produce something you want to buy. It is the most effective system we have discovered to enable people who hate one another to deal with one another and help one another.”

5) ""Workers paying taxes today can derive no assurance from trust funds that they will receive benefits from when they retire. Any assurance derives solely from the willingness of future taxpayers to impose taxes on themselves to pay for benefits that present taxpayers are promising themselves. This one sided 'compact between the generations,’ foisted on generations that cannot give their consent, is a very different thing from a 'trust fund.' It is more like a chain letter.""

4) ""There are four ways in which you can spend money. You can spend your own money on yourself. When you do that, why then you really watch out what you’re doing, and you try to get the most for your money. Then you can spend your own money on somebody else. For example, I buy a birthday present for someone. Well, then I’m not so careful about the content of the present, but I’m very careful about the cost. Then, I can spend somebody else’s money on myself. And if I spend somebody else’s money on myself, then I’m sure going to have a good lunch! Finally, I can spend somebody else’s money on somebody else. And if I spend somebody else’s money on somebody else, I’m not concerned about how much it is, and I’m not concerned about what I get. And that’s government. And that’s close to 40% of our national income.""

3) ""Indeed, a major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that it... gives people what they want instead of what a particular group thinks they ought to want. Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.""

2) ""If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there'd be a shortage of sand.""

1) “I do not believe that the solution to our problem is simply to elect the right people. The important thing is to establish a political climate of opinion which will make it politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right thing. Unless it is politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right thing, the right people will not do the right thing either, or if they try, they will shortly be out of office.”",14,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/forjme/still_true_today/,1585147793.0,forjme
tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,[Not-Socialists] What do you think of Cherán?,"[Cherán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher%C3%A1n) is a small town in Mexico, in 2011 they overthrew the local government and drug cartels that were illegally logging in their area. Afterwards, they restored indigenous systems of governance which resemble libertarian socialism, based around direct democracy and common ownership. Key things to note about the town:

>Political parties were banned   
>  
>Today, five years later, those checkpoints still exist. They are  guarded by members of the Ronda Comunitaria - a militia or local police  force made up of men and women from Cheran.  Every vehicle is stopped,  its occupants questioned about where they have come from and where they  are going.   
>  
>Serious law-breaking is referred to the attorney general. But in the  last year there have been no murders, kidnaps or disappearances.   
>  
>If you live somewhere unaccustomed to rampant, violent crime, you  might not find this surprising. But Michoacan is one of Mexico's  bloodiest states - where severed heads have been rolled across dance  floors and grenades have been lobbed into crowded plazas. In July, there  were over 180 murders in the state - the highest number for nearly a  decade.  And in the communities around Cheran - not even 10km away -  stories of kidnap, extortion and murder are commonplace.      
>  
>""In Cheran, I  feel safe because I can walk the streets at night, and I don't fear that  something's going to happen,"" says Melissa, who's now an 18-year old  bio-medical student at a college just outside Cheran.  
>  
>It is not just the streets of Cheran that are secure. The pine forest  - a sea of green that tumbles down the hills to the town below - was  ravaged by the loggers. Now its perimeter is patrolled daily by the  officers from the Ronda Comunitaria.  Land in Cheran is mostly held in  common - families manage it but they don't own it. With the criminals  gone, rules are strictly enforced - anyone who wants to fell a tree must  secure permission from the authorities.      
>  
>And slowly, the forest is being regenerated. It is estimated that  over half the town's 17,000 hectares of forest were devastated by  organised crime. Some 3,000 hectares have so far been re-planted in the  five years since the uprising, the seedlings nurtured in the town's own  tree nursery.

My questions are as follows: 

What do you think of Cherán?

Reformists, is this a successful example of a violent revolution against a technologically superior enemy in the modern day that didn't degenerate into totalitarianism?

Environmentalists, is this a good thing?

Capitalists, why hasn't their socialist economy based on common ownership and creation of worker cooperatives failed yet?

Authoritarian Socialists, why didn't their lack of a centralised state capable of repressing capitalists and counter-revolutionaries and imperialists hinder them?

Anti-Democracy types, why haven't the usual predictions of direct democracy (ie only works with 150 people, makes decisions too slow, can't defend itself, leads to tyranny of the majority etc) happened yet?",155,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/ew6g88/notsocialists_what_do_you_think_of_cherán/,1580395497.0,ew6g88

tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,"Anarchy vs Anarchy+ --- If you primarily hate hierarchy, you are not an anarchist.","Let's be clear, there is one thing you need to do to qualify as an anarchist: **you must oppose the state.**

That is all. That is the end of it.

Any qualifications you want to add after that have nothing to do with the *concept of anarchism* and should either be classified as historical baggage or useless fluff.

You want to argue that anarchism means opposition to hierarchy? No, you are lying to yourself. If you hate hierarchy more than you hate the state, you are an ahierarchist, not an anarchist.

Anarchism means opposition to the state.

Ahierarchism means opposition to hierarchy.

If you disagree with that, you are a propagandist or deluded. If you think opposition to hierarchy *means* you are an anarchist, you are deluded. Yes the state is a compulsory hierarchy, but it is the compulsion that is objectionable, the force, not the hierarchy.

No one has an exclusive claim on the word 'anarchist' and if you want to gate keep the label of anarchism from people WHO OPPOSE THE STATE just because they don't accept the same historical baggage that you do, then fuck you. 

Anyone who opposes the state IS AN ANARCHIST.

If you come back and say, yeah an anarchist opposes the state, BUT...

Anything you place after that word is not anarchism, it is something else being added into anarchy, it is what some would call *anarchy+,* the plus standing for all the things *in addition to anarchy* that you consider crucial to the concept, but which have nothing to do with anarchy.

Now you may think opposition to hierarchy is crucial to anarchy, but this is foolish. There are all sorts of voluntary and unavoidable hierarchies in life, many of which are not states and are not abusive. Truly consistent opposition to hierarchy, that is someone who believes in ahierarchism, would mean you must oppose all hierarchies, you can't pick and choose. Many voluntary hierarchies are absolutely good and wholesome, like a teacher teaching a student, or a leader of any endeavor whose followers follow voluntarily. Leaders are not rulers.

If you truly oppose all hierarchy, you must oppose the family, which is the original hierarchy. You must oppose the authority of parents over children. 

And if you believe that, you're a fucking idiot and you know it, which is why people who say they oppose hierarchy are sneaking in all sorts of unspoken assumption and qualifications which means that they *don't really oppose hierarchy carte blanche, they actually just mean they hate capitalism*.

Yeah that's right, the whole idea behind anarchism+ and all this false pretense about hierarchy, which anarchy+ proponents *do not actually believe,* *is actually an attempt to sneak anticapitalism into the concept of anarchism.* It has given anarchists+ cover to stop focusing on the state and instead complain about businesses.

But notice that this *shift in emphasis* means they are betraying the concept of anarchy in the process. One man cannot serve two masters, nor two ideals. Either you oppose the state, or you oppose capitalism. Pick one, because they are *not* the same thing.

Yes anarcho-capitalists will continue to claim the label of anarchist and rightly so, *because you don't own the concept of anarchy*. Even the attempt to gate-keep that term is in fact a denial of anarchy as a concept in the first place. Anarchy cannot be ruled nor controlled! 

You can keep calling yourself an anarchist(+), but if you throw shade at ancaps as 'not real anarchists' then you're just as bad as the state. 

Meanwhile, if you frame anarchy in terms of opposition to hierarchy rather than opposition to the state, realize that you are *literally betraying* the concept of anarchy!

Ruling means these politicians can force law on you and everyone. That compulsion, which we did not choose to enter into, is evil and wrong and must be destroyed.

But if you replace that with a system based on majority rule, you have gained nothing. Majority rule just creates a new compulsory hierarchy where the tyranny of the majority holds all power.

Political power must absolutely be decentralized down to the level of the individual, and individual consent must become the foundation of a future stateless society.

And that means that you will NOT be able to destroy capitalism, which functions on the basis of voluntary choice among willing participants, yes *even without a state*.

If that makes you angry, it's because *you're not a real anarchist*. Stop fetishizing against hierarchy and return to true anarchy: opposition to the state. 

Whatever society builds after that point, capitalist or not, you should be completely in favor of. And btw, ancaps assume that leftists will build non-capitalist societies in a future where ancap ideas have replaced the nation-state, why is it that you anti-hierarchy types seem to assume ancap societies couldn't even exist in your supposedly stateless society.

Fucking lying to yourselves. You want to create a new state to make things turn out your way and you're too chicken to admit it even to yourselves.

Those few of you that are actual hardcore lefty anarchists and actually believe in anarchy above all, and not these milquetoast anarchy+ believers that are little more than socialist-lite wannabes, I salute you.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/dgbphg/anarchy_vs_anarchy_if_you_primarily_hate/,1570779390.0,dgbphg
tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,Debt and Defining Socialism: Is it even possible for best case Socialism to look like anything other than robust social democracy?,"This is just me trying to wrap my mind around mechanisms for ownership and what ownership, fundamentally is.

&#x200B;

The way I see it, all societies are based on debts, legitimized through force. This has never not been the case. The nature of what debts are has changed, but not that fact, so much to the point where I cannot even imagine what it means for a potential society to not be based on it. In modern capitalist societies there are two major categories of debt that society is based around: physical commodities and the ability to demonstrate and enforce claims of ownership, and fiat currency, which is a generalized token that is made valuable by being enforced as legal tender for all debts public, just as it says on the banknotes issued by The United States Federal Reserve.

&#x200B;

As varying degrees of centralized control have been taken in managing social debts, throughout every society as of yet, all societies have had tokenized debt. Under The Soviet Union, you had vouchers for items for a time, which are, themselves, just tokenized debt, like money, but with limited exchange value. ""Common Ownership"" takes place through a centralized government entity, which is functionally the same thing as a corporation, but with shares in that corporation equally distributed throughout the society and not transferable between members of society.

&#x200B;

It seems to me like the degree to which a hands off or hands on approach to the nature of the distribution is a good thing in terms of not expecting people to manage vouchers and instead to manage general money. A central problem with the economy is that there is some degree of scarcity in the way we can shape our human labor, skills, and physical resources, into goods and services that make our lives better. Increasing the scale with which we devote resources to any one type of good or service increases efficiency per unit produced, but decreases verity of choice. We could probably calculate a set of food options which would satisfy 99.9% of peoples individual dietary requirements in a way that uses the least amount of resources possible and that best and most sustainably manages the food we produce, with special orders to fill the needs of the 0.1%. And then we could have the government produce these foods at the largest scale possible. This would massively save on food production, maybe as much as 80-90%. But you would have to eat the same thing every day.

&#x200B;

Opening up the market on food enables people to have the choice necessary to not be forced to have the same meal every say, but it decreases efficiency, because now there is opportunity for entrepreneurial individuals to play to the human desire to eat different things from different people. Even if we did this through central planning, the central planner would have to expend more resources on making more and different kinds of factories and restaurants to produce more varied food stuffs. If people really did only want the atomic nutrition that would make them the most healthy for the least amount of money, the market could not have possibly become as varied as it is. I doubt that most people here will assert that mere capitalist propaganda formed their preferences for food, but that a desire for varied food options is an authentic human desire that will emerge in spite of a lack or abundance of propaganda that plays to it.

&#x200B;

This sentiment can be spread across all types of goods and services. We often have wants for novelty that are somewhat hard to plan for in a centralized way. On top of that, it would seem to me that just the association of who produced a good or service can color its seeming authenticity. Amazon is an avatar of institutional oppression in our system, and yet it signifies a capability to provide satisfactory service in what it provides in a way that people would deify if provided by a smaller business less capable of systematic tyranny. If a family mexican restaurant invented The Crunchwrap Supreme, it would be seen as indicative of the ability for the lonely near proletarian to act more nimble in satisfying the authentic human desire for novel food. Because Taco Bell made it, it at least is somewhat tinged with the spirit of faceless corporatism, because the inventors of that item are ultimately just another cog in the machine of corporate dominance over our lives.

&#x200B;

As we move forward into a more socialistic sentiment, I cannot help but fail to grasp how meaningfully different much of our economy would be in certain fundamental ways. Would we create a Public Food Service Industry? If we did, would it be specialized to create a lot of a few things, or would it simply be enabled to create massive scale factories which can be tooled and retooled to meet a massive verity of desires with as much efficiency as possible? And what is the responsibility of the average person to plan for this system?

&#x200B;

Democratic control over the means of production sounds great, and it would probably increase efficiencies in a sense, but I don't think people understand the ridiculous responsibility that would be involved in that.

&#x200B;

What do you want for lunch in 3 months? We now have a central planning system for what food we produce, so now you have to help plan. So we are all going to democratically vote for the sorts of foods that we are going to attempt to produce for the next three months, so you are going to have to sit down at a computer and type of an excel spreadsheet out of your preferences. What if, as you go through time, you start to feel oppressed by your own decisions. Even if you are in the 90% of people who gets the food system to produce what you said you want on that later date, what if, when that date comes, and a notice on your computer says ""congratulations, what you said you wanted is delivered, you get to eat that today"" what if you feel nagged and controlled by your own inability to predict what you want in 90 days 90 days ago, and now what you have to eat most days feels like oppression.

&#x200B;

A step down from this is liquid democracy. Maybe you don't want to plan every meal, but you have general preferences that you want generally fulfilled, so you give the power of your vote to a culinary expert who can manage millions of other preferences and come up with a compromise of the food produced. And this results in a dozen or few dozen standard meals produced at places near you everyday, and you can pick what you want from those. Well, this is pretty much what the market already does. People have money, business people try their best to guess what people would want and they create things that hopefully enough people want. The only difference is that in modern society, some people have a lot of money and some people have not that much, so the system is incentivized to spend more and more resources per calorie producing a small supply of oppulent food that a few people can enjoy, and another part produces decent food that more people can enjoy, and basic food that most people can enjoy, and some people cannot enjoy any food except at the charity of others. Solving this problem looks pretty much like a great redistribution of money so that even the poorest people have enough debts that society owes to them that society will be in debt to even the poorest people in society a decent choice of food.

&#x200B;

In other words, it seems to me like the best possible form of socialism that could occur pretty much just looks like social democracy. Whether or not there is still inequality between the amount of debts that individual in society owns, there are still programs in society that ensures that even the people we are the least indebted to in society, we are in debt to enough that those people can get a decent meal or clothes or a house or entertainment or whatever. And, because we are not some genius hive mind, there are necessary hierarchies of people who will be entrusted to make decisions as to the goods and services that society will produce to fulfill the wants that people cannot even anticipate they have yet. And this would simply be done naturally out of the realization of how much more efficient those hierarchical structures are. A ""socialistic society"" therefore, seems to be one where we form and constantly check hierarchies with the consciousness of how tyrannical they can become, unchecked. We will come to an implicit or explicit agreement as to a fair amount of tyranny that could possibly occur, and how much we will just accept as a necessary evil, the happy medium between large scale efficiency that comes from giving a few people the power to manage a lot of resources so that everyone else can do other things, and the tyranny that can inevitably develop from a few people having more power than the average.

&#x200B;

I fail to see how such a system does not look like anything other than robust social democracy. And I fail to see how anything that tries to go any further does not impose a ridiculous soul crushing amount of responsibility on every individual in society to constantly report their constant desires into a system that can only respond to every individual desire that could be had in the moment, and hope that what it produces based on those assertions will still satisfy people when produced.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/bl50yt/debt_and_defining_socialism_is_it_even_possible/,1557101437.0,bl50yt
tyranny,CapitalismVSocialism,A manifesto for renewing liberalism,"This article appeared at The Economist. I believe it belongs here.

[https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/13/a-manifesto-for-renewing-liberalism](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/13/a-manifesto-for-renewing-liberalism)

&#x200B;

Success turned liberals into a complacent elite. They need to rekindle their desire for radicalism.

LIBERALISM made the modern world, but the modern world is turning against it. Europe and America are in the throes of a popular rebellion against liberal elites, who are seen as self-serving and unable, or unwilling, to solve the problems of ordinary people. Elsewhere a 25-year shift towards freedom and open markets has gone into reverse, even as China, soon to be the world’s largest economy, shows that dictatorships can thrive.

For *The Economist* this is profoundly worrying. We were created 175 years ago to campaign for liberalism—not the leftish “progressivism” of American university campuses or the rightish “ultraliberalism” conjured up by the French commentariat, but a universal commitment to individual dignity, open markets, limited government and a faith in human progress brought about by debate and reform.

Our founders would be astonished at how life today compares with the poverty and the misery of the 1840s. Global life expectancy in the past 175 years has risen from a little under 30 years to over 70. The share of people living below the threshold of extreme poverty has fallen from about 80% to 8% and the absolute number has halved, even as the total living above it has increased from about 100m to over 6.5bn. And literacy rates are up more than fivefold, to over 80%. Civil rights and the rule of law are incomparably more robust than they were only a few decades ago. In many countries individuals are now free to choose how to live—and with whom.

This is not all the work of liberals, obviously. But as fascism, communism and autarky failed over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, liberal societies have prospered. In one flavour or another, liberal democracy came to dominate the West and from there it started to spread around the world.

# Laurels, but no rest

Yet political philosophies cannot live by their past glories: they must also promise a better future. And here liberal democracy faces a looming challenge. Western voters have started to doubt that the system works for them or that it is fair. In polling last year just 36% of Germans, 24% of Canadians and 9% of the French thought that the next generation would be better off than their parents. Only a third of Americans under 35 say that it is vital they live in a democracy; the share who would welcome military government grew from 7% in 1995 to 18% last year. Globally, according to Freedom House, an NGO, civil liberties and political rights have declined for the past 12 years—in 2017, 71 countries lost ground while only 35 made gains.

Against this current, *The Economist* still believes in the power of the liberal idea. Over the past six months, we have celebrated our 175th anniversary with online articles, debates, podcasts and films that explore how to respond to liberalism’s critics. In this issue we publish [an essay](https://www.economist.com/essay/2018/09/13/the-economist-at-175) that is a manifesto for a liberal revival—a liberalism for the people.

Our essay sets out how the state can work harder for the citizen by recasting taxation, welfare, education and immigration. The economy must be cut free from the growing power of corporate monopolies and the planning restrictions that shut people out of the most prosperous cities. And we urge the West to shore up the liberal world order through enhanced military power and reinvigorated alliances.

All these policies are designed to deal with liberalism’s central problem. In its moment of triumph after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it lost sight of its own essential values. It is with them that the liberal revival must begin.

Liberalism emerged in the late 18th century as a response to the turmoil stirred up by independence in America, revolution in France and the transformation of industry and commerce. Revolutionaries insist that, to build a better world, you first have to smash the one in front of you. By contrast, conservatives are suspicious of all revolutionary pretensions to universal truth. They seek to preserve what is best in society by managing change, usually under a ruling class or an authoritarian leader who “knows best”.

# An engine of change

True liberals contend that societies can change gradually for the better and from the bottom up. They differ from revolutionaries because they reject the idea that individuals should be coerced into accepting someone else’s beliefs. They differ from conservatives because they assert that aristocracy and hierarchy, indeed all concentrations of power, tend to become sources of oppression.

Liberalism thus began as a restless, agitating world view. Yet over the past few decades liberals have become too comfortable with power. As a result, they have lost their hunger for reform. The ruling liberal elite tell themselves that they preside over a healthy meritocracy and that they have earned their privileges. The reality is not so clear-cut.

At its best, the competitive spirit of meritocracy has created extraordinary prosperity and a wealth of new ideas. In the name of efficiency and economic freedom, governments have opened up markets to competition. Race, gender and sexuality have never been less of a barrier to advancement. Globalisation has lifted hundreds of millions of people in emerging markets out of poverty.

Yet ruling liberals have often sheltered themselves from the gales of creative destruction. Cushy professions such as law are protected by fatuous regulations. University professors enjoy tenure even as they preach the virtues of the open society. Financiers were spared the worst of the financial crisis when their employers were bailed out with taxpayers’ money. Globalisation was meant to create enough gains to help the losers, but too few of them have seen the pay-off.

In all sorts of ways, the liberal meritocracy is closed and self-sustaining. A recent study found that, in 1999-2013, America’s most prestigious universities admitted more students from the top 1% of households by income than from the bottom 50%. In 1980-2015 university fees in America rose 17 times as fast as median incomes. The 50 biggest urban areas contain 7% of the world’s people and produce 40% of its output. But planning restrictions shut many out, especially the young.

Governing liberals have become so wrapped up in preserving the status quo that they have forgotten what radicalism looks like. Remember how, in her campaign to become America’s president, Hillary Clinton concealed her lack of big ideas behind a blizzard of small ones. The candidates to become leader of the Labour Party in Britain in 2015 lost to Jeremy Corbyn not because he is a dazzling political talent so much as because they were indistinguishably bland. Liberal technocrats contrive endless clever policy fixes, but they remain conspicuously aloof from the people they are supposed to be helping. This creates two classes: the doers and the done-to, the thinkers and the thought-for, the policymakers and the policytakers.

# The foundations of liberty

Liberals have forgotten that their founding idea is civic respect for all. Our centenary editorial, written in 1943 as the war against fascism raged, set this out in two complementary principles. The first is freedom: that it is “not only just and wise but also profitable…to let people do what they want.” The second is the common interest: that “human society…can be an association for the welfare of all.”

Today’s liberal meritocracy sits uncomfortably with that inclusive definition of freedom. The ruling class live in a bubble. They go to the same colleges, marry each other, live in the same streets and work in the same offices. Remote from power, most people are expected to be content with growing material prosperity instead. Yet, amid stagnating productivity and the fiscal austerity that followed the financial crisis of 2008, even this promise has often been broken.

That is one reason loyalty to mainstream parties is corroding. Britain’s Conservatives, perhaps the most successful party in history, now raise more money from the wills of dead people than they do from the gifts of the living. In the first election in unified Germany, in 1990, the traditional parties won over 80% of the vote; the latest poll gives them just 45%, compared with a total of 41.5% for the far right, the far left and the Greens.

Instead people are retreating into group identities defined by race, religion or sexuality. As a result, that second principle, the common interest, has fragmented. Identity politics is a valid response to discrimination but, as identities multiply, the politics of each group collides with the politics of all the rest. Instead of generating useful compromises, debate becomes an exercise in tribal outrage. Leaders on the right, in particular, exploit the insecurity engendered by immigration as a way of whipping up support. And they use smug left-wing arguments about political correctness to feed their voters’ sense of being looked down on. The result is polarisation. Sometimes that leads to paralysis, sometimes to the tyranny of the majority. At worst it emboldens far-right authoritarians.

Liberals are losing the argument in geopolitics, too. Liberalism spread in the 19th and 20th centuries against the backdrop first of British naval hegemony and, later, the economic and military rise of the United States. Today, by contrast, the retreat of liberal democracy is taking place as Russia plays the saboteur and China asserts its growing global power. Yet rather than defend the system of alliances and liberal institutions it created after the second world war, America has been neglecting it—and even, under President Donald Trump, attacking it.

This impulse to pull back is based on a misconception. As the historian Robert Kagan points out, America did not switch from interwar isolationism to post-war engagement in order to contain the Soviet Union, as is often assumed. Instead, having seen how the chaos of the 1920s and 1930s bred fascism and Bolshevism, its post-war statesmen concluded that a leaderless world was a threat. In the words of Dean Acheson, a secretary of state, America could no longer sit “in the parlour with a loaded shotgun, waiting”.

It follows that the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991 did not suddenly make America safe. If liberal ideas do not underpin the world, geopolitics risks becoming the balance-of-power, sphere-of-influence struggle that European statesmen grappled with in the 19th century. That culminated in the muddy battlefields of Flanders. Even if today’s peace holds, liberalism will suffer as growing fears of foreign foes drive people into the arms of strongmen and populists.

It is the moment for a liberal reinvention. Liberals need to spend less time dismissing their critics as fools and bigots and more fixing what is wrong. The true spirit of liberalism is not self-preserving, but radical and disruptive. *The Economist* was founded to campaign for the repeal of the Corn Laws, which charged duties on imports of grain into Victorian Britain. Today that sounds comically small-bore. But in the 1840s, 60% of the income of factory workers went on food, a third of that on bread. We were created to take the part of the poor against the corn-cultivating gentry. Today, in that same vision, liberals need to side with a struggling precariat against the patricians.

They must rediscover their belief in individual dignity and self-reliance—by curbing their own privileges. They must stop sneering at nationalism, but claim it for themselves and fill it with their own brand of inclusive civic pride. Rather than lodging power in centralised ministries and unaccountable technocracies, they should devolve it to regions and municipalities. Instead of treating geopolitics as a zero-sum struggle between the great powers, America must draw on the self-reinforcing triad of its military might, its values and its allies.

The best liberals have always been pragmatic and adaptable. Before the first world war Theodore Roosevelt took on the robber barons who ran America’s great monopolies. Although many early liberals feared mob rule, they embraced democracy. After the Depression in the 1930s they acknowledged that government has a limited role in managing the economy. Partly in order to see off fascism and communism after the second world war, liberals designed the welfare state.

Liberals should approach today’s challenges with equal vigour. If they prevail, it will be because their ideas are unmatched for their ability to spread freedom and prosperity. Liberals should embrace criticism and welcome debate as a source of the new thinking that will rekindle their movement. They should be bold and impatient for reform. Young people, especially, have a world to claim.

When *The Economist* was founded 175 years ago our first editor, James Wilson, promised “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” We renew our pledge to that contest. And we ask liberals everywhere to join us.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/9fun9u/a_manifesto_for_renewing_liberalism/,1536950714.0,9fun9u

Too many rich white people? Few people in history have had courage or luxury to speak and think freely so obviously that where I focus my attention. Rest assured that I would maximum amount of people to be free, but I don't believe we can get there by listening to people who haven't had the opportunity to develop intellectually or simply squandered their opportunity. Liberalism is also uniquely western invention, so I don't see how could there be few white people. I any case here are some non-western thinkers and politicians.

propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,"Mikhail Makarenko, an important dissident from Soviet Moldova","Mikhail Makarenko was a true anti-communist. Why? Because he used to be a communist before. 

Makarenko was born in 1931 in Galati, Romania, in a Jewish family. In 1939, fascism and antisemitism were on the rise in Romania, so he illegally crossed the border into the USSR, in the Moldovan ASSR. At 8 years old. Alone. He did this because he believed the communist propaganda - he believed that the USSR was a country with no repression, no racism - an utopia. But he found out himself that he was wrong. While in orphanage houses, he faced antisemitism, and, when WW2 started, he was sent to the frontline - despite the fact that he was a child. 

After WW2, he became an active promoter of liberal arts, of independent painters, not influenced by socialist realism. Because of this, he was repressed - he spent 11 years in Soviet gulags, before he was expelled from the USSR. He moved to the United States, where he talked about the abuses in the USSR. When asked if he was a victim of communism, he replied: ""**Everyone who lived in the 20th century was a victim of communism"".** Which is why I am talking about Makarenko here: he was not a an anti-communist because he was a fascist, a landowner, a member of the bourgeoisie - but because he found out that communism was nothing of what he thought it is. Communism sounds good, but it always fails.

Sadly, Makarenko died in 2007, at 75 years old, being beaten to death by a mentally-ill person in on the streets of New Jersey. May God rest his soul. ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1mi6om5/mikhail_makarenko_an_important_dissident_from/,1754393561.0,1mi6om5
propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,"no state can ""implement capitalism"" also, capitalism is not ""free markets"".","capitalism, at its core, is the principle of individual control. it is contrasted with socialism, which prioritizes collective or social control. socialism can only be implemented through systems of social authority, whereas capitalism requires the absence of such systems having any power to override individual autonomy. in this sense, capitalism cannot be imposed by a state, as doing so would reduce individual control to mere permission—a facade easily revoked by those in power. this is analogous to lending a car to a friend; while they may use it temporarily, ultimate ownership remains yours, and their control is illusory.

there is no ""under capitalism,"" no ""implementing capitalism,"" and no ""capitalist political system."" either the state cannot interfere with you and your property, or it can. if it can, any resemblance to capitalism is superficial and incomplete.

it is also important to distinguish capitalism from free markets. while capitalism necessarily leads to free markets, free markets can exist independently of capitalism. a free market allows voluntary exchange with minimal interference, but this does not guarantee individual control over property. socialist systems often permit limited free markets. even in north korea, one of the least capitalist systems imaginable, small-scale free markets exist.

the united states is not a capitalist system because it allows extensive regulation of commerce. the commerce clause in the constitution, as interpreted by the supreme court in cases like *wickard v. filburn* (1942), clearly demonstrates that individuals do not have absolute ownership of their property. this conclusion is further reinforced by laws like civil asset forfeiture, property taxes, sales taxes, and eminent domain, as well as a myriad of regulations dictating nearly every aspect of economic life.

these regulations control what you can grow, where you can build, how you can build, what jobs you can perform, how long you can work, the currency you can accept, how little or how much you can charge or earn, where you can rent property, what you can sell, what you can consume, and sometimes even mandate what you must consume, as with certain occupational vaccination requirements.

the united states is not capitalist; it is a controlled system that claims to be capitalist. many are deceived by this propaganda, engaging in debates over how much socialism is the ""right"" amount without realizing the system is already far from capitalism.

to be mostly capitalist while maintaining order, a system must confine the state’s role to the defense of individual ownership and protection against violations such as theft, fraud, or abuse of communal natural resources (e.g., air, water, and wildlife). anything beyond this introduces social control and moves the system away from capitalism. those who believe the united states is even predominantly capitalist misunderstand the nature of capitalism itself.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1hy792g/no_state_can_implement_capitalism_also_capitalism/,1736523804.0,1hy792g

propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,Socialists must acknowledge that the grand socialist idea can be dismissed,"# Preface and definition

The grand socialist idea is the abolishment of the private ownership of all means of production, for some even the abolishment of all private asset ownership (see e.g. Engels). Singular occurrences of regulation, or state ownership of parts of the economy don’t make a society socialist. We already know that socialists have big internal disagreements. Different parts are clinging to different, often mutually exclusive interpretations of their (sometimes) seemingly “holy books” of political philosophy. Some forms of socialism even force adherents into absurd conclusions such as the stance that [private net metering with solar panels should be illegal](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/18s47us/socialists_should_people_be_allowed_to_own_solar/).

**In this post, I shall argue against socialisms basic, core idea and expose the lies and propaganda on this sub**.

# Capitalism creates wealth

Our modern societies can be called capitalist (except for a few border cases where dissent exists), because they generally allow for private ownership of the means of production, something which is forbidden under socialism.

Indeed, private enterprises and industries undoubtedly dominate the world market, and have transformed the lives of billions. It is clear that capitalist ideas such as market competition, privatization and deregulation have fostered an environment that is filled with big successful companies. Unprofitable or un-innovative companies are pushed out of the market, leaving it with a collection of enterprises which billions can profit from. [The world GDP growth in the last 100 years has been literally exponential](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run?time=1940..latest), and the total world GDP has risen by over 1425% since 1940. Nobody can deny that this system has made a lot of people incredibly wealthy.

# This wealth is accessible, common socialist critiques are a myth

The common socialist idea that the rich can only become richer if the poor become poorer (e.g. [NascentLeft](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1e7h69l/comment/le0qfyh/), [eliechallita](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1e84mjg/comment/le4r46r/), [RA3236](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/sxeev7/comment/hxsgcft/)) is nothing but fake news (see e.g. [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/8rkfej/comment/e0s3x7x/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/8rkfej/comment/e0s3x7x/), [https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/187yxjk/comment/kbhta30/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/187yxjk/comment/kbhta30/) ), as is the believe that the average working Joe has no access to the growing capital (e.g. [real wages](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/COMPRNFB), [shared income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1qsqn)), or that capitalism [requires continuous growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/18q6bt1/comment/ket3pu1/).

We know that GDP is correlated with a lot of important factors of wellbeing, such as the [Augmented Human Development Index](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/augmented-hdi-vs-gdp-per-capita), [literacy](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/literate-and-illiterate-world-population), [life expectancy](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy), [child mortality](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-gdp-per-capita), and the access to technology(https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/access-to-electricity-vs-gdp-per-capita?time=2017..latest , [https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/mobile-economy/](https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/mobile-economy/) ). Even though capitalism sometimes causes relative inequalities, it is an empirical fact that the absolute wealth of also the poorest percentiles of global society increases at a fast pace.

# Commonly mentioned shortcomings can be resolved

Of course, every system has its shortcomings, and companies need to be regulated to a degree. External costs (climate, environment), natural monopolies, business cycles, inflation and other shortcomings, as well as their implications for welfare are well studied and understood (Micro/Macro/Welfare -economics). Yes, capitalism has had its crashes, but we were always able to bounce back to a stable economy. It turns out that we can still learn a lot about economics and finance from such crashes – and have emerged more knowledgeable and stronger than before. The market crash in 2008 has led to significant improvements of our understanding of markets, including even drastically more sophisticated theories about financial derivative modeling.

Our modern hybrid economy is able to improve the lives of billions, and successfully provides critical services like healthcare, education, housing and poverty protection, especially in Europe(https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-with-universal-healthcare , [https://www.statista.com/chart/24050/social-spending-by-country/](https://www.statista.com/chart/24050/social-spending-by-country/), [https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/safetynets](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/safetynets) ). Also worker rights are routinely addressed, work-life-balance has improved and we work less hours overall (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-working-hours-vs-gdp-per-capita-pwt ).

# Failures of Socialist Systems and Policies

The world has learned through theoretical and empirical research that a lot of the shortcoming of capitalism can be dealt with via regulations and contractual agreements – there is no need for state/national control or ownership, which leads to mismanagement and is inefficient. Remember that government ownership and control of huge parts of the industries around the world was as fact after the world war.

“Consistent with the evident lack of aversion to state ownership, the postwar state assumed an enormous role in production throughout the world, owning everything from land and mines to industrial factories and communications to banks and insurance companies to hospitals and schools—even in market economies! In some of these economies, such as Japan, the United States, and Germany, government ownership was restrained, while in others, such as Italy, France, and Austria, the state assumed control of significant parts of production. Most developing countries opted for state ownership of the so-called ‘‘strategic’’ sectors. In socialist economies, the state came to own not just the strategic sectors, but everything else as well.” – Andrei Shleifer

It is clear why modern countries in the west, Asia, and developing countries continually opted out of their government-controlled industries. Their inefficiencies can be quantitatively understood and are already present for a benevolent government. Actual real governments obviously enhance this issue (https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.12.4.133 ). Efficiency problems with [market socialism](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/oxo0zl/comment/h7o258m/) are well known. Co-ops are a [common occurrence](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/v38alp/comment/iaxrkmu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) in the modern world. We know they can sometimes work, but most of the time, they just get pushed out of the market by more profitable companies. It is also clear that socialism actually suffers from a lot of theoretically understood issues such as the economic calculation problem (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/16ky56u/comment/k0z2pbz/ ).

All of this is in line with the strongly upward steepening country GDPs starting in the second half of the twentieth century. Unsurprisingly, we see steepening GDPs for most of the countries in the world, as they transition from socialist to liberal policies. Sure, there have been a lot of different historical, technological, political and local events that have influenced the shape of those curves. But to deny that capitalist profit orientation, efficiency and innovation, and the abandonment of socialist ideas, has had a dramatic impact on this growth is indefensible. (Note: even though we can have local bumps in the curves, on aggregate, liberal policies enhance growth. This also becomes apparent from looking at averaged curves for multiple countries at the same time. Plenty such curves are available at [World Bank](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run?time=1940..latest), where you can also learn about inflation and other adjustments that were performed to obtain them.). We don’t need to find an actual full blown socialist country in order to realize that socialist policies are detrimental for the growth and wellbeing of a society.

# Conclusion

Socialists must admit that we are and have been able to analyze socialist policies and ideas theoretically and in empirically. Those ideas have proved to be inefficient, and undesirable. The only way out for the socialist is to cling to the idea that even though many socialist policies themselves are bad ideas for our welfare, somehow, if all socialist policies are implemented/present at the same time, and the grand idea has been fulfilled, suddenly their system becomes superior again. Given the presented arguments, this appears highly unlikely and requires serious proof in order to be taken seriously.

As you know, great claims require great evidence. If you ask me, Id say it takes a fair amount of almost religious believe to hold such a position. Modern economic consensus is definitely not convinced (see e.g. [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/hrkvoe/comment/fy4v374/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/hrkvoe/comment/fy4v374/) , [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/16ky56u/comment/k0zxvit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/16ky56u/comment/k0zxvit/) ,[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/q8yen7/comment/hgssz39/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/q8yen7/comment/hgssz39/), https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/199ydqf/comment/kihfzwp/).

**Until such evidence is presented, I conclude that the grand socialist idea can be scientifically dismissed.**

Summary:

* **Private Ownership and Market Competition**: Capitalism’s success is attributed to private ownership of means of production, market competition, and innovation, leading to significant GDP growth and overall wealth increase, since (as shown) everybody can participate in the growth.
* **Failures of Socialist Systems**: Historical attempts (from government owned enterprises in 1940-present, and analogously worker owned enterprises / co-ops) at socialism often resulted in inefficiencies and mismanagement. Socialism means abolishing the ownership of private property. Loads of private property ownership had been abolished during the war economy. This is a bad idea because private ownership leads empirically to more efficient results. The economic calculation problem and the inefficacy of government ownership are highlighted.
* **Modern Hybrid Economies**: Today's mixed economies, combining regulated capitalism with social safety nets, are posited as successful models that provide essential services and improve quality of life.
* **Empirical Evidence**: Data shows that capitalism correlates with higher access to literacy, life expectancy, and access to technology and growing capital. The argument refutes the notion that capitalism necessitates inequality or that it excludes the poor from benefiting from economic growth.
* **Theoretical and Practical Understanding**: The understanding gained from economic crises and regulatory measures is cited as evidence that capitalism can adapt and address its shortcomings, unlike socialism which is viewed as inherently flawed, as shown by modern economic theory.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1eaav00/socialists_must_acknowledge_that_the_grand/,1721748885.0,1eaav00
propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,The flaws in Capitalists funded Hitler into power.,"If you have been on the internet and see debate around capitalism vs socialism in Nazi Germany. There is this very common belief that Capitalists funded Hitler into Power. There are many issues with this. Impressivecourage466 listed 24 individuals as Capitalists wide support for Hitler, but out of those 24 individual only 2 could have been said to have been Capitalists that funded Hitler into power. Even then those 2 can not stand up to further scrutiny than ""were they capitlalists?"" and ""did they fund Hitler in anyway?""

In this topic however there are many issues, one of which was who was funded and another was when. Bergbauverein, Hermann, Steinke, Osram, IG Farben, Lange, AEG, Springorum, and Accumulatorenfabrik AG gave a grand total of 2.1 million Reichsmarks to Hitler between the 23rd of February to 13th March 1933. To a keen observer however you might have realized something Hitler was already Chancellor in January 1933. So of the supposed [3m Reichsmarks](https://www.roberthjackson.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Closing_Argument_for_Conviction_of_Nazi_War_Criminals.pdf)  that funded Hitler into power came, after he was already in power. You then have individuals like, Kirill Vladimirovič Romanov, who gave 500000 gold marks to Ludendorff which only equated to rough 13000 Reichsmarks, this was also before Hitler had any presence. Even with people like Gustav Krupp, he gave around a Million Reichsmarks again after Hitler was already in office. [Sir Henri Deterding](https://royaldutchshellplc.com/1936/12/30/sir-henri-deterding-and-the-nazis/) also never gave money to the Nazi, he bought agriculture products to send it Germany.

There was another interesting instance of where Leftist misportray the events that actually occurred, industrialists said in the even of a Marxist uprising they promise 5 million Reichsmarks to fight the uprising. Hitler was not just given 5 million Reichsmarks and because the communists never rose up he never got the money. Again this was After January 1933 when Hitler was already Chancellor.

There were in reality only a Few Capitalists that funded Hitler in any way before he got into power. Emil Kirdorf was 1 of them however he stepped away from the part and stopped funding the party only after a year of membership in 1928. Bernhard Reemtsma and for him he didn't so much finance Hitler's rise in as much as he financed anyone that was in charge of tax legislation. Funny enough for Reemtsma, he meet with Hitler in 1932 July and after that meeting his cigarette ads were plastered in Nazi newspaper, this was not so much Reemtsma funding Hitler as Hitler making a moral compromised to get campgain funds. Since Nazis hated cigarettes and were concerned about public health. Hjamlmar Schacht a wasn't party member did not fund Hitler into power given he was unemployed during Hitler's Rise. More interesting note on Schacht is that I have never seen evidence that Schacht gave money to the Nazi party at all. Schacht then spent time in a concentration camp. And Finally, Fritz Thyssen he gave the Nazi party a loan, which the Nazis had to repay. Thyssen did give money to Ludendorff but not Hitler, and this was during a the time Hitler was not a major player. Thyssen also had his business take away from, spent time in a concentration camp, and was extremely critical of their economic policies.

There were business that supported Hitler, just like there were generals, artists, novelists, and politicians. But it was not ""capitalists"" support it was a few capitalists supported the Nazi rise.

To Quote Richard Evans:

>Nazi student leaders often got themselves deeply into debt by paying personally for posters and pamphlets with many others it must have been the same. The Nazi party depended on such commitment; much of its power and dynamism came from the fact that it was not dependent on big business or bureaucratic institutions such as trade unions for its financial support as the 'bourgeois' parties and the Social Democrats to varying degrees were, still less on the secret subsidies of a foreign power, along the lines of the Moscow-financed Communists. The result of all this was that business proved not much more willing to finance the Nazi Party than it had been before. True, one or two individuals like Fritz Thyssen were enthusiastic, and provided funds to subsides, the extravagant tastes of leading Nazis, such as Hermann Goring and Gregor Strasser. And, in broad terms, the speech was reassuring. When the time came, it made it that much easier for big business to come round to the support of the Nazi Party. But in January 1932 this still lay some way in the future. For the time being, the Nazi Party continued, as before, to finance its activities mainly through the voluntary contributions of its members, through entry fees to its meetings, through the income from its press and publications and through donations from small firms and businesses rather than large ones.

And to quote Turner:

>Beginning in the early 1930's and continuing down to the present, such charges have been repeatedly made. they form the core of one of the earliest and most persistent explanations, for the origins of the Third Reich. That explanation accords a decisive role to bug business and classifies Hitler's regime as a manifestation of capitalism. That view have proved too doctrinaire and reductionist for most historians, who prefer analysis that takes a larger range of factors into consideration. Yet because of the surface plausibility of the charges leveled against big business and the ceaseless repetition of those charges, even mainline historians have, with few exceptions, felt obliged to include big business support among the factors contribution to the triumph of Nazism.

This topic has essentially been diluted into propaganda. After Hitler's rise, yes businesses attempted to try stay on good terms with the Regime but that does not mean they attempted to put him into power.

To put the bow on it, Hitler hated Capitalists:

>The persistent war against German 'heavy industries' was the visible start of the internationalization of German economic life as envisaged by the Marxists. This, however, could only be brought to a successful conclusion by the victory which Marxism was able to gain in the Revolution. As I write these words, success is attending the general attack on the German State Railways which are now to be turned over to international capitalists. Thus 'International Social-Democracy' has once again attained one of its main objectives.



>It was left to the Revolution to destroy this standard organization, until a time came when it was taken out of the hands of the nation and socialized, in the sense which the founders of the Republic had given to that word, namely, making it subservient to the international stock-exchange capitalists, who were the wire-pullers of the German Revolution.



>The War was now a hopeless affair, and only the foolhardy could think of victory. It was not the people but the capitalists and the Monarchy who were interested in carrying on.



>That objective was the destruction of the national economic system and the establishment of international capitalistic domination in its stead. And this goal has really been reached, thanks to the stupid credulity of the one side and the unspeakable treachery of the other.

Essentially every issue was because of Capitalist.

------------------------

So I will end this with saying, just because it sounds nice does not mean it is. Capitalists did not fund Hitler into power, most investments capitalists made occurred after Hitler was in power, and this was not a guarantee that would be free from state influence. The Nazi policy was not Privatization in such private business flourished, and instead the policy was called Gleichschaltung or synchronization. With the entire goal of Nazification of society and ""socializing"" the people of Germany.

propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,Objective Truths about Capitalism (fixed),"Somone posted a list of objective truths about capitalism and then, not shocking, tried to list just about every subjective misinterpretation or skew or lie about capitalism they could.  I though that since some people might have been disappointed, I would show what an actual objective truth of capitalism list would look like.  


  
Here's a list of objective truths about capitalism I am tired of being debated or ignored. If you support capitalism you should be fully aware of what it is.

  
Capitalism is an economic system. In America, there is a ""two-party democracy"" that serves the people, which includes, businesses, corporations, organizations and private entities, basically all of society in a balancing act of the needs and wants of all, which certainly conflict at times. Capitalism has some connections to the political system as this system manages the regulations which give rule and law to capitalism, as well as protecting all the rights of all participates there in. Capitalism perpetuates a world where countries fight to maintain ""global superpower"" status. World superpowers are measured on how much they can trade and produce with other nations, as well as competitively out trade and out produce them as well.

  
Capitalism inevitably and naturally presents as a system of competition. It is a competition played on almost all levels, from education, job seeking, your co workers, departments, companies, industries, etc.

  
Businesses operated for a few various reasons, but profit is generally one of them.  If the goal is not profit, then it is a charity.  Profit is needed to at minimum maintain solvency, to product the business, the employees, and even businesses which conduct business between themselves.

  
Most of US tenants can afford rent because the vast majority of people are not homeless.  For the first time in a long long long while, in the last few years homelessness has started increasing.  This is due to the increase in drugs crossing into the country and increased in rates of addiction.  More potent drugs like fentanyl are helping to turn the tide of progress. Other factors that help this difficult issue is inflation, rising house prices.  House prices keep rising because supply has not kept up with demand due to decades of zoning restrictions limiting the building of apartments, townhomes, and low cost housing.    


  
Billionaires are not inherently unethical.  Inherently unethical means that something is unethical by default of its nature.  A billionaire could be an ethical or unethical person.  A person with a label that is inherently unethical must have a label with is, crazy enough, inherently unethical.  A serial killer is inherently unethical.  A nazi is inherently unethical.  Socialist, which require the taking of property and money by force/violence from those who owned/earned/have it are advocating theft and that is inherently unethical.

  
Because of the free market, hoarding in capitalism isn’t really a thing.  Anything that exists can be bought and sold, products, property, time.  A car lot with 1,000 cars is not hoarding cars from anyone; you just have to buy the car.

  
Frankly, capitalism is objectively a poverty cure on a global scale, which has over time has replaced outdated and unfair systems such as feudalism, colonialism, and Imperialism. I'm not exaggerating.  It has taken the majority of people out of absolute poverty, but not everyone.  The results it has done in a short amount of time compared to our history is astounding.

  
Capitalism, like socialism, has had slavery.  Like the Congolese people are enslaved.  Slavery, the evil that it is, is not inherent to either capitalism or socialism.  In fact any crime or unethical manner that appears in both systems means that it is an issue with the human condition, and not something propagated by the system itself.

  
The healthcare system in America is screwed up, but this is an issue of America.  All other capitalists systems have universal health care, and a good portion of those have health care systems with lots of major issues.  


A major issue facing the world is climate change, which governments need to act on.  The governments of the world are there to act for the people.  It isn’t Macy’s and AT&T’s wheelhouse to solve climate change.  The only way private industry can be involved is if the governments start taking climate change seriously and write checks to have innovation occur to save us all.  But climate change itself is an issue of the amount of people and usage, which would exist all the same in capitalism or socialism with the same amount of people.  


  
Corruption is an issue too, but not of capitalism as this, too, exists in socialism.  


  
Capitalism creates inequality.  This is what it is supposed to do.  If it didn’t, then people would stay where they are without growth. We want people to make more, do better.  This is progress, success.  We want everyone to have this, but the biggest issue holding people back from success in capitalism is the culture.  There is a culture that convinces people to work against capitalism, to not work for what you want, to not study and do good in school, to not try your best in whatever you do, to not risk or sacrifice or put your time in now for a greater benefit later.  Capitalism is a game where everyone who plays wins in some way, on some level or another.  Those who don’t win are the few who either cannot play at all or do not want to play.    


  
There is no exploitation in capitalism.  People sell their labor for a value they agree to, and businesses pay for the labor at the agreed upon price.  Anything that happens out of those parameters is a crime.  Inside those parameters, it is a negotiation and an agreement, both getting something more valuable than what they are giving away.  

  
A company hopefully makes a profit on the labor it buys, but the labor isn’t the only thing that goes into the profit.  There are also materials and services, and how they are all managed, combined, marketed, and sold.  All of this, together and not separate or alone, creates the value and the profit.  The coffee shop that makes a profit owes that profit to the barista as much as it owes it to the phone company, the electrical company, the landlord, and the coffee cup printer.   

  
What anyone does with their money, with their property, is the business of that person and no one else.  How they use it, and who they give it to, alive or dead, is their perogative.  What someone makes at their job, through their trading and sales, through their risk and leveraging, is not yours to just take.  


  
Capitalism is not a failure because some people committed a crime, or broke a rule or law, or did something against the laws or rules of the system.  Capitalism did not fail if someone without merit succeeded.  Capitalism is not bad because someone who is a capitalists said something negative or greedy.  Everything has exceptions.  Proving something exists doesn’t mean that everyone in the system is that thing.  That is how racists think.  “Someone of this color committed a crime against me so ALL of them are like this.”  That is the logic at hand when this arguments are put out, but they are all false fallacies.  No matter what Trump and Musk did yesterday, today, or tomorrow, they are not the elected and agreed upon examples of capitalism and the guilt of their actions and choices are of their own actions and inactions, and not that of the system they operate in.  


  
Capitalism is not perfect.  It cannot be.  Any system that is build around competition has an inequality to it.  The fairness is in unequal outcomes.  Governments which host capitalism tend to do a decent job of caring for people who are legitimately unable to work due to mental and physical handicaps.  But the people who choose not to work, who steal, who get welfare when they don’t really need to and can just get a job, they keep the system from reaching it’s full potential as well as themselves.  But there isn’t much capitalism can do about this because it is built around people exercising their free will, not stifling it.

propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,Objective Truths About Capitalism,"Here's a list of objective truths about capitalism I am tired of being debated  or ignored. If you support capitalism you should be fully aware of what it is. 

🪙 Capitalism is both an economic and political system. It's not just an economic system, no. In America, we have a false ""two-party democracy"" that serves corporations and private entities, not society or the environment we live in. Through political influence, capitalism is largely a global economy through passive and asserted force. Capitalism perpetuates a world where  countries fight to maintain ""global superpower"" status. World superpowers are measured on how much they can i̶n̶f̶l̶u̶e̶n̶c̶e̶ exploit other nations. 

🪙 Capitalism inevitably and naturally delves into Imperialism and Colonialism. And no, not ""every society/system of government"" is naturally prone to imperialism and colonialism. Because there is an unnecessary infinite need for wealth/power, private ownership, and market expansion. Profit seeking and stomping out competition. Full control for full reaping is ideally what capitalists want. To be a ""World Superpower"" 

🪙 Half of US tenants cannot afford rent because our economic system is designed to destabilize the working class and exploit us by nature. We have more homeless than homes because capitalism is inherently criminal. Billionaires are inherently unethical. 

🪙 They need us to work to produce profit, but they need even more people and land to hoard and exploit. Capitalism *requires* and *administors* impoverished nations and people. Capitalism is inherently class warfare because people don't want to be exploited. Exploitation and domination are key functions. 

Frankly, capitalism is objectively a human crime on a global scale, just like how we consider feudalism, colonialism, and Imperialism to be. I'm not exaggerating. 

Capitalism is why the Congolese people are enslaved, why people in America are oppressed, why Palestine isn't free, why the French people are forced to work more in their lifetime, why climate disasters are worsening, why we're hitting record mass extinction etc etc etc. 

It's all connected. None of us are free until we all are. It's not a theory or an opinion. We live in a world where *nukes* exist and we have to vote every 4 years to not get blown up because power is the end all be all to capitalism. 

I am tired of the gaslighting and propaganda. The ""Red Scare"" was a hoax that holds us back to this day. 

Edit: of course capitalist supporters will comment in ignorance or say these are my opinions or say socialism is inherently bad. All dismissive and gaslighting.

propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,Laissez-Faire As State Regulation,"I am of the opinion that talk of more or less government intervention in markets is incoherent in, for example, the United States today. It is not as if some configuration of property rights, contract law independent of the state, corporations with limited liability, and markets of various types are all natural constructs, existing prior to all human interventions. I have gone on about this before: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/18ralmx/an\_intervention\_in\_the\_economy\_is\_illdefined/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/18ralmx/an_intervention_in_the_economy_is_illdefined/) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/17y68yy/coercion\_and\_distribution\_in\_a\_supposedly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/17y68yy/coercion_and_distribution_in_a_supposedly/).

Sophisticated neoliberals recognize that a capitalist market order must be constructed; it does not come about naturally. Only some promoting propaganda on behalf of the wealthy recognize this.

Antonio Gramsci makes a closely related point:

""The ideas of the Free Trade movement are based on a theoretical error whose practical origin is not hard to identify; they are based on a distinction between political society and civil society, which is made into and presented as an organic one, whereas in fact it is merely methodological. Thus it is asserted that economic activity belongs to civil society, and that the State must not intervene to regulate it. But since in actual reality civil society and State are one and the same, it must be made clear that laissez-faire too is a form of state 'regulation', introduced and maintained by legislative and coercive means. It is a deliberate policy, conscious of its own ends, and not the spontaneous, automatic expression of economic facts. Consequently, laissez-faire liberalism is a political programme, designed to change - in so far as it is victorious - a State's leading personnel, and to change the economic programme of the State itself - in other words the distribution of the national income."" -- Antonio Gramsci, Prison Notebooks, ""The Modern Prince"", Some Theoretical and Practical Aspects of 'Economism' 

Given the current conjuncture in, say, the United States, that bit about income distribution is of contemporary relevance.

propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,"Socialist News Today: Should Venezuela invade its oil-rich neighbor? Maduro will put it to a vote Sunday. Gee, I wonder why such nice people get sanctions.","In a provocative move, Nicolás Maduro's government in Venezuela is including a controversial question in an upcoming referendum, asking whether the government should be granted special powers to invade neighboring Guyana and claim a significant portion of its oil-rich territory. This century-old territorial dispute, exacerbated by Guyana's recent oil discoveries, has raised regional tensions and even the specter of armed conflict. Some experts view this as a political ploy by Maduro to boost domestic support, but the potential consequences are alarming.

The border dispute, rooted in the 19th century, has been reignited as Guyana seeks international resolution through the United Nations' International Court of Justice. Maduro's push for nationalism through the referendum is seen as a risky strategy that could escalate into a military confrontation. The audacious move to ask for public endorsement to invade a neighbor is criticized as absurd, with concerns raised about the potential loss of citizenship for Guyanese residents in the disputed area. Maduro's aggressive propaganda campaign, coupled with fears of forced annexation, has created a volatile situation with potential repercussions beyond the immediate conflict.

Critics point out the hypocrisy of Venezuela complaining about sanctions while simultaneously threatening military action against a neighboring sovereign nation. The international community, including Brazil and the United States, has expressed objections to Maduro's actions, emphasizing the potential for greater isolation if armed conflict were to ensue. The situation underscores the challenges of Maduro's leadership, with accusations of leveraging nationalism for political gain, risking regional stability, and diverting attention from domestic issues in Venezuela.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/188kc31/socialist_news_today_should_venezuela_invade_its/,1701459249.0,188kc31
propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,[Capitalists] Poor people exist,"It seems like capitalists on here forget that poor people exist.  Like in every post about how government public services are terribly inefficient and the private sector always is better.  Ignoring for now the validity of that statement, what about people who can't pay for those services?

""Charity, duh!"" Oh God, of course, charity can do it! If we give people all their tax money back, they'll definitely give out just as much to pay for all the poors to get high-quality education, healthcare, retirement, and housing for nothing. Right?

This has never worked.  Even back a century ago when a sense of local community was still alive and people believed in helping others (under threat of punishment from God, but, you know, whatever works); back before individualism and profit motive was drilled into everyone's brains from infancy, private Catholic schools were failing from lack of funding *while* they were relying almost entirely on an unpaid labor force (nuns) to do the teaching.

But today? It's laughable to think we could fund private schools with charity. Probably the best we could hope for are corporate-funded propaganda mills. And the dystopian hellscape that would be would still be miles ahead of any privately-funded healthcare. At least there's long-term economic incentive to train a worker force from infancy to be obedient peons, but there's zero for healing random people.

And the things capitalists think they can rely on for efficient charity are only possible because of government. One great example is means testing.  There's all sorts of jail and other bad things that will happen to me if I lie to the government about my income, etc.  If I lie to some private charity so I can get free cancer treatment? I guess in the unlikely event they find out, they sue me to try to claw back some the money? Good luck with that, there are no public records and all my money is in Bitcoin in capitalist utopia.

So the only hope for efficient charity is to make it so shitty, only the poorest people will want to use it.  So it's time for capitalists to start mentioning, when talking about the efficiency of private services, that there's going to be a ton of illiterate, homeless, poor people dying from measles in this golden era.",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/15h5pwv/capitalists_poor_people_exist/,1691072757.0,15h5pwv

propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,Dekulakization as mass violence,">1) CONTEXT  
>  
>Dekulakisation, or the “liquidation of the kulaks as a class”, was part of Stalin’s “second revolution” (or “revolution from above”), launched at the end of 1929 with the decision to collectivise millions of peasant households. The economic backwardness and political estrangement of the peasantry, which comprised the vast majority of the population of the Soviet Union, was the Achilles’ heel of Soviet power. The peasant’s support for the Bolshevik revolution, spured on by the 8 November1917 Decree on Land, granting the peasants’ demands for ownership of the land and fulfilling the dreams of rural Russia since the peasant uprisings of the 17th century, was short-lived. As early as 1918, as the Bolsheviks desperately needed to collect grain to secure their power and fight the civil war, forced grain collections by armed groups of Red Army soldiers and hastily armed workers’ detachments alienated the same peasant producers who had helped bring down the old tsarist order with their violent rebelliousness. The civil war in the countryside was brutal and lethal. Millions of peasants died in the conflict, some fighting on one side or the other, many simply caught in between the back and forth of the competing White and Red armies. The forced expropriation of grain and attempts to collectivise the countryside led to pitched battles between peasants and the new representatives of Soviet power. Peasant uprisings broke out in Ukraine, in the Tambov region, along the Volga and in Western Siberia. By the beginning of 1921, Lenin and the Bolsheviks had no choice but to retreat to the countryside. In March 1921, they introduced what was called the New Economic Policy (NEP), which called for a halt to the requisitionning of grain and allowed the peasants to accumulate and trade in grain products. Many historians consider the NEP period as simply a pause, a “truce” between the first major Bolshevik war against the peasantry (1919-1921) and the second and final one to follow (1929-1933) (Graziosi, 1996).  
>  
>  
>  
>However, the context was different: whereas in 1920-21 large segments of the peasantry had actively resisted Boshevik policy, in 1929-30 it was the pacified peasant society that was the target of the Stalinist revolution from above. To justify his attack, Stalin referred to the “threat” that ”rich peasants”, labelled “kulaks”, posed to the very survival of the Soviet regime, which was supposedly being strangled by the kulaks’ deliberate refusal to sell their grain to the state. Stalin and many Party leaders were still traumatised by the threat of starvation experienced by many town dwellers during the civil war and wanted to ensure that such a possibility would never again recur.  
>  
>  
>  
>The “dekulakisation” campaign begun in January 1930 had in reality a twofold objective: to “extract” (the term used in secret police directives) “elements” likely to resist the collectivisation of the countryside being undertaken at the same time; and to “colonise” the vast, inhospitable areas of Siberia, the Northern Region, the Urals and Kazakhstan. The first objective corresponded to the view, clearly expressed by the Bolsheviks when they took power, that peasant society contained “exploitative elements” that were irremediably hostile to the regime and that would sooner or later have to be “liquidated as a class”. In fact, Stalin merely repeated Lenin’s famous diatribes against the “kulaks”: since 1918, “kulaks”, an artificially constructed group, had been subjected to stereotyping and deshumanisation; they had been designated, in the press and propaganda, as “cockroaches”, “blood-suckers”, “vampires”, or just plain “scum”, “vermin” and “garbage” to be cleansed, crushed and liquidated (Colas, 1995). The official policy of “liquidation of the kulaks as a class”, adopted by the Stalinists at the end of 1929, did not, however, imply physical liquidation of all “kulaks”. The great majority of them were to be expropriated and deported, thus fulfilling the second objective of “dekulakisation”: to provide cheap labour for the colonisation and economic development of the country’s inhospitable areas, which were rich in natural resources. In three years (1930-1932), more than 5 million “kulaks” were either expropriated or reduced to poverty after having had to sell, hurriedly, their property (the authorities called this process “self-dekulakisation”); 2.3 million men, women and children were deported (of whom approximately half a million died untimely deaths); over 300,000 were arrested and interned; between 20,000 and 30,000 were sentenced to death by extra-judicial courts.

>  
>On 27 December 1929, Stalin publicly demanded “the eradication of all kulak tendencies and the elimination of the kulaks as a class”. A commission from the Politburo, chaired by Viatcheslav Molotov, was tasked with pursuing all measures needed to achieve this goal. On 30 January 1930, the commission issued a secret resolution defining three categories of “kulaks”:  
>  
>  
>  
>\- those “engaged in counterrevolutionary activities” (“first category”) were to be arrested and transferred to work camps or executed if they put up any resistance. Their families were to be deported and all their property confiscated. The resolution set a limit of 63,000 household heads in the “first category” (in fact, 284,000 persons were to be arrested during the first six months of the dekulakisation campaign as ”kulaks of the first category, 20,000 of whom were sentenced to death by troïki, extra-judicial commissions);  
>  
>  
>  
>\- those “who manifested less active opposition to the Soviet state but were arch-exploiters and naturally supported counter-revolution”, placed in the “second category”, were to be arrested and deported with their families to remote areas of the Northern region, Siberia, the Urals and Kazakhstan. All their property – except the most essential domestic goods, a minimum amount of food and up to 500 rubles per family – was to be confiscated. The Molotov commission set, for a number of regions and republics, quotas of “second-category kulaks”: the total number was 154,000 households (in fact, 400,000 families were to be deported in 1930-1931);  
>  
>  
>  
>\- the remainder of the kulaks, described as “loyal to the regime” and classified in the “third category”, were to be expropriated and resettled on “land requiring improvement, outside the limits of the collective farm lands but within the administrative district in which they lived” (Davies, 1980; Ivnitskii, 1996; N.Werth, 1997).  
>  
>  
>  
>It is important to note that the so-called “kulaks” were first and foremost defined in terms of families, not as individuals. Thus, not only were the head of the family and his wife considered “kulaks”, but also their children and, more broadly, all their relatives, young and old (elderly persons, children and infants constitued in fact the majority of the deported, and the majority of those who died untimely deaths, see section III).  
>  
>  
>  
>Coordinated in each district by a troika (three-man commission) composed of the First Secretary of the local Party committee, the president of the local Soviet Executive Committee, and the head of the local GPU, operations were carried out, from the first days of February 1930, by special dekulakisation commissions and brigades.  
>  
>  
>  
>These bodies comprised a mix of people: Communist Party activists from large factories mobilised and sent to the countryside especially for the occasion, local Communist functionaries, GPU (secret police) functionaries and various village “activists”. Sergo Ordjonikiidze, one of Stalin’s closest advisers, explained in the following terms who these “activists” were: ”Because there are almost no Party activists in most villages, we generally install a komsomol (member of the Communist Youth movement) in the village and force two or three poor peasants to join him, and it is this aktiv that personally carries out all of the village business of dekulakisation” (Graziosi, 1996).  
>  
>  
>  
>True, the lists of first-category kulak households were drawn up exclusively by the GPU. The target figure of 63,000 first-category kulaks was met in less than two weeks. By 15 February 1930, according to a report adressed to Genrikh Iagoda, the GPU Deputy-Chief, 64,589 “kulaks in the first category” had already been arrested. Most of the victims appear to have been on index-cards catalogues of suspects assembled over the years by the GPU (Danilov & Berelowitch, 2003).  
>  
>  
>  
>Lists of kulak in the other two categories were made on the spot at the recommendation of local authorities and village “activists”. The dekulakisation brigades had to meet the required quotas and, if possible, surpass them. This opened the door to all sorts of abuses and settling of old scores. Dekulakisation often became generalised plundering and ravaging (Lewin, 1966). Everyone in the village understood that “kulak” belongings were at the disposal of those willing to come forward and grab them. As noted in many GPU reports, this pushed “the villages’ criminal elements to join a nucleus of young and more or less enthusiastic believers”. According to a GPU report from Smolensk, “the brigades took from the wealthy peasants their winter clothes, their warm underclothes, and above all their shoes. They left the kulaks standing in their underwear and bare feet. They took everything, even old rubber shoes, women’s clothes, tea worth no more than 50 kopeks, water pitchers and pokers (…) They confiscated everything, even the pillows from under the heads of babies, and stew from the family pot, which they smeared on the icons they had smashed” (Fainsod, 1969). Dekulakised properties were usually simply looted or given away at auction: wooden houses were sold for 1 ruble, cows for 20 or 30 kopeks each, a hundredth of their real value.  
>  
>  
>  
>The violence perpetrated by the dekulakisation gangs was horrific. “These people”, noted one GPU report, ”drove the dekulakised naked in the streets, beat them, organized drinking-bouts in their houses, shot over their heads, forced them to dig their own graves, undressed women and searched them, stole valuables, money, etc. (Graziosi, 1996).  
>  
>  
>  
>Deportations of “second-category kulaks” began as early as the second week of February 1930. According to a plan approved by the highest Communist Party authority, the Politburo, chaired by Stalin, 90,000 families were to be deported as part of a first phase that was to last until the end of April. The Northern region was to receive 45,000 families, the Urals, Siberia and Kazakhstan 15,000 each. In fact, during this first phase, which lasted until the end of May, over 99,000 families (510,000 people) were deported (Danilov & Berelowitch, vol.3/1, 2003). To carry out these arrests and deportations, military logistics, unprededented in peacetime and mobilising hundreds of rail convoys and tens of thousands of special troops provided by the GPU, were set up. However, the vast scale of the project led to huge problems in coordinating the militarised deportation operations carried out by the GPU and the settlement of the deportees, which was left to the initiative of local authorities, which were overwhelmed by the task or simply indifferent to the fate of the dekulakised peopl. To transport the “dekulakised”, the GPU allocated, for the “first phase”, 280 convoys of 50 cattle trucks, each of them transporting between 1,500 and 2,000 men, women and children, and a limited amount of the deportees’ tools, food and personal belongings (each family was in theory allowed to take 25 puds – or 400 kg – of luggage, but many “dekulakised” had practically nothing to take with them after their homes had been looted). As the rather acerbic correspondence between the GPU and the People’s Commissariat of Transport demonstrates, the formation and progression of the convoys was invariably a painfully slow process. In the great depots, such as Vologda, Kotlas, Rostov, Sverdlovsk or Omsk, convoys would remain for weeks, filled with their human cargo. When railway convoys finally arrived at their destination, the interminable journey often continued for several hundred more kilometres on sledges (in winter), carts (in spring), or even on foot. In accordance with official instructions, deportees were to be “settled some way distant from any means of communication” (Danilov & Berelowitch, 2003). As the authorities in the district of Tomsk (Western Siberia) reported on 7 March 1930, “the deportees arrived on foot, since we have no spare horses, sleighs or harnesses. (…) In view of the present situation, it has been impossible to transport the two months’ supplies that the kulaks are entitled to bring with them” (Danilov & Krasilnikov, vol.1, 1993). It was therefore without provisions or tools, and often without any shelter, that the deportees had to begin their new lives. One report from the province of Arkhangelsk in September 1930 admitted that of the planned 1,641 living quarters for the deportees, only seven had been built. Hundreds of thousands were left to their fate on the steppes or in the middle of marshy pine forests without regular food supplies or work. The fortunate ones who had been able to bring some tools with them could build some sort of rudimentary shelter, often the traditional zemlianka, a simple hole in the ground covered with branches.  
>  
>  
>  
>Epidemics and acute shortages (and even, in some cases, famine) decimated the deportes, first of all the children and the elderly (see section III, Victims). Amidst this deadly chaos, the strongest and most resolute escaped (for example, 15% of the 230,000 “dekulakised” deported to the Northern region had escaped by December 1930). GPU reports mentioned another serious problem: by the end of 1930, fewer than 10% of adult deportees had been put to work (Viola, 2007).  
>  
>  
>  
>A few days before the launching of a second wave of “dekulakisation”, aimed at “totally cleansing the kulaks from all agricultural regions” (secret telegram sent by G. Iagoda to all republican and regional GPU plenipotentiaries on 15 March 1931, in Danilov & Berelowitch, vol. 3/1, 2003), the Politburo established, on 11 March 1931, a special commission chaired by V. Andreev, member of the Politburo, with G. Iagoda playing a key role. The first objective of the Andreev commission was to “halt the dreadful mess of the deportation of manpower” and to “organise a rational and effective management of the deported workforce”. Preliminary enquiries by the commission revealed that the productivity of the deported workforce was almost zero. Of the 200,000 “dekulakised” people deported to the Urals, a mere 8% were detailed to “productive activities” in April 1931. All other able-bodied adults were “just trying to survive”. The Andreev commission reorganised the management of the deportees by granting the GPU power over the organisation and supervision of all the stages of the deportation and settling of the deportees. A whole network of komandatury, run by the GPU, was set up to supervise and organise all aspects of the everyday life and working conditions of the deportees. Deportees, known in the police jargon as spetzposelentsy (“special displaced persons”) were stripped of their civil rights, forced to reside in designated areas (called spetzposelki, or “special settlements”) and subjected to a veritable forced labour in agricultural, industrial or mining structures controlled by the GPU. The GPU also rented the deportees under its control, in exchange for a commission, to a number of state-run industrial enterprises, such as Urallesprom (forestry), Uralugol, Vostugol (coal mining) and Tsvetmetzoloto (non-ferrous minerals, gold), exploiting the various natural ressources in the northern and eastern parts of the USSR. These companies were to provide living quarters for their workers, schooling for children, and a regular supply of food for all. In reality, their managers usually treated this slave workforce as a source of free labour. The deportees were expected to produce 30-50% more than the free workers, and their pay (when they were paid at all) was pitiful (Danilov & Krasilnikov, 1994).  
>  
>  
>  
>While the Andreev commission was trying to rationalise the economic exploitation of the deportees, the Politburo was drawing up grandiose plans for the deportation of 200,000 to 300,000 kulak families, mainly to Western Siberia and Kazakhstan (Danilov, 2001, vol.3). This second wave of deportation began in early May 1931, and lasted for nearly five months. According to a GPU report dated 30 September 1931, 265,795 “kulak families” (1,243,860 persons) were deported, more than twice as many as in 1930, which was, until recently, seen as the apex of the “dekulakisation” campaign. True enough, the second-wave deportations appear to have been carried out more efficiently than those of the first wave in 1930: there were fewer cases of deportees being simply abandoned in the taïga or the steppe; most of them were allocated to construction sites, mines or forestry (Danilov & Berelowitch, 2003).  
>  
>  
>  
>Deportations continued in 1932-1933, but at a slower pace. The 1932 plan for deportations of kulaks, discussed by the Politburo in April 1932, foreshadowed the banishment of 38,000 families in May-August. This plan was, however, not “fulfilled”: only 71,000 people were registered as “newcomers” in the 1932 registers of the GPU-run spetzposelki. A further 268,000 peasants were deported the following year, in 1933 (V.Zemskov, 2003)  
>  
>  
>  
>The number of people deported to distant regions during the 1930-1933 dekulakisation campaigns accordingly works out at about 2.3 million. On top of this, we must add those who were shipped directly to the gulags (the so-called first-category kulaks): approximately 300,000 to 350,000 people (Danilov & Berelowitch, 2003).  
>

>  
>3) VICTIMS  
>  
>During the 1920s, Party theoricians and state officials tried hard to define criteria to identify the “kulaks”. A few months before the launching of the dekulakisation campaign, the Sovnarkom (the Council of People’s Commissars, i.e. the Soviet government) suggested the following five features by which a kulak farm might be identified (a single one of these features was sufficient for people to be categorised as “kulaks”):  
>  
>  
>  
>1- A farm that regularly hires waged labour;  
>  
>  
>  
>2- A farm possessing an “industrial undertaking”, such as a mill, a butter-making establishment, a wool-combing installation, etc.;  
>  
>  
>  
>3- A farms that hires out power-driven agricultural machinery;  
>  
>  
>  
>4- A farm that hires out premises;  
>  
>  
>  
>5- A farm whose members are involved in commercial activities or who have income not deriving from work (Lewin, 1966).  
>  
>  
>  
>Several of the definitions were disquietingly vague, above all “other income not deriving from work”. Given the context of the dekulakisation campaign, especially the effects of a frantic propaganda campaign that constantly exaggerated the enemy’s cunning, treachery and skill in concealing himself, it was easy for zealous and vigilant executants to find “kulaks” wherever they chose to look. Dekulakisation brigades resorted to outdated and often-incomplete tax returns kept by the rural soviets, information provided by the GPU, and denunciations by neighbours tempted by the possibility of gain. Peasants were arrested as “kulaks” and deported for having sold grain on the market or for having had an employee to help with the harvest back in 1925 or 1926, for possessing two samovars or for having killed a pig in September 1929 “with the intention of consuming it themselves and thus keeping it away from socialist appropriation”. Peasants were labelled “kulaks” on the pretext that they had “speculated”, when all they had done was sell something of their own making. Peasants were deported on the pretext that some of their relatives had fought in the White Army or because of their “numerous visits to the church”. Many people were labelled “kulaks” simply on the grounds that they resisted collectivisation (Fainsod, 1969; Davies, 1980; Lewin, 1966). In fact, dekulakisation often turned into social cleansing of all “socially alien elements”, among whom featured “police officers of the Tsarist regime”, “White officers”, former landlords and shopkeepers, members of the “rural intelligentsia” (among them many teachers), many of whom had joined the SR (socialist-revolutionary) party in 1917-18. One of the few GPU reports giving details on the socioprofessional occupations of dekulakised people during the first stage of the campaign (Volga region, February 1930) shows that the so-called kulaks represented only 55% of the total; the “middle peasants” (seredniaks) accounted for 15%; shopkeepers 15%; priests, monks and nuns 6%; teachers and other members of the rural intelligentsia 4%; and “others” 5% (Danilov & Berelowitch, 2003).  
>  
>  
>  
>How many “kulaks” died in the course of “de-kulakization”? On 1 January 1932, the GPU carried out a general census of all deportees: it listed 1,317,022 people. We know, by the same police sources, that nearly 1.8 million “kulaks” were deported during the two main deportation waves in 1930 and 1931. Losses accordingly numbered close to half a million people, or nearly 30% of all deportees. Undoubtedly, a not insignificant proportion of those had escaped. In 1932, the GPU komandatury, which actually managed to keep accurate records of the deportees they were supposed to keep watch over, counted no less than 207,000 escapes (38,000 runaways were recaptured); in 1933, the number of escapes was 216,000 (54,000 recaptured). Considering a number of local GPU reports (for different periods in 1930 and 1931) on the flights of deported “kulaks”, we can extrapolate that around 200,000-250,000 deportees managed to escape in 1930-31. This still leaves us with approximately 250,000-300,000 deaths. A number of local reports confirm the very high mortality rates among the deportees, especially among children and elderly people. In 1931, the mortality rate was 1.3% per month (16% per annum) among the deportees to Kazakhstan, and 0.8% per month (10% per annum) for those to western Siberia. Infant mortality oscillated between 8% and 12% per month, and peaked at 15% per month in Magnitogorsk. From June 1931 to June 1932, the mortality rate among deportees in the region of Narym, in Western Siberia, reached 11.7%. In 1932, the overall number of deaths among deportees was over 90,000 (annual death rate: 6.8%); in 1933, it was 151,600 (annual death rate: 13.3%). Altogether, more than half a million deportees died in 1930-33, or 22% of the 2.3 million people deported during those years. Most of them died untimely deaths, of general exhaustion and hunger (Zemskov, 2003; Danilov & Krasilnikov, 1993, 1994, Viola, 2007).

>4) DEKULAKISATION: “CLASS GENOCIDE”?  
>  
>Was dekulakisation “class genocide”? This classification was first proposed in 1997 by Stéphane Courtois, in his introduction to The Black Book of Communism. “The death from starvation of the child of a Ukrainian kulak is ‘equivalent’ to the death from starvation of a jewish child in the Warsaw ghetto”, he writes (Courtois et. al, 1997). Is this process of equating “class genocide” with “racial genocide” really sustainable? It is important to note that, in Courtois’s argument, two very different forms of mass violence are lumped together: the “liquidation of the kulaks as a class” (1930-32) and the Ukrainian famine of 1932-33, which affected all the peasants in the collective farms of that Soviet republic. A number of factors lead us to be very doubtful about the applicability of the term “class genocide” when applied to the kulaks. Although the kulaks, as an artificially designated and constructed group, were subjected to the kind of dehumanisation and stereotyping that was common for victims of genocide throughout the 20th century, the regime did, from the outset, introduce distinctions within the victim group (first, second and third categories). “Liquidation of the kulaks as a class” did not imply physical liquidation of all kulaks, even though the terrible conditions in which the deportation took place and the “settlement” of the kulaks, who, at least in the first stages of the dekulakisation operations, were often abandoned in the middle of the taïga or the desert steppes, caused a very high rate of mortality that sometimes reached 15% per annum (and much higher in the case of children). It is also clear that the sociological defining lines of the “kulak” group are not just flexible, but in fact are not definitions at all. Genocide is said to occur when a group is targeted in terms of what essentially defines it: the criterion of the group’s stability must be existent for the qualification of genocide be applicable, and in the case of dekulakisation, this is manifestly not the case. Moreover, contrary to Soljenitsyn’s assertion (“children of kulaks carried the mark of Cain throughout their lives”), the pariah-status of the dekulakised was not carried forward to the next generation: from 1938 onwards, children of kulaks who reached the age of 16 were allowed to leave their place of deportation if they continued their schooling beyond the required age. Three years later, hundreds of thousands of children of kulaks were mobilised into the Red Army. Such integration into the army ipso facto removed all the legal discrimination that had been imposed on children of kulaks, even though their parents continued to be second-class citizens (Zemskov, 2003). There was clearly some commitment to the idea of “nurture” over “nature” in the Stalinist social engineering project (Weiner, 2003). On the other hand, we should not forget that several hundred thousand “former kulaks” – many of whom had fled from the “special settlements” to which they had been deported – were arrested during the “Great Terror” of 1937-38. The largest “mass secret operation”, launched by NKVD Order N°00447 dated 30 July 1937, specifically targeted, among other categories, “former kulaks, deported in previous years, who have escaped from the special settlements”. In the course of this “secret operation”, which lasted 15 months (August 1937-November 1938), over 800,000 people were arrested and sentenced, of whom over 400,000 were executed. It is generally believed that former kulaks (both those who had fled from the “special settlements” and those who were still living there) contributed to approximately one quarter of the victims of Order N°00447. In many ways, this “mass operation” was the last blow against the hated “kulaks”, the last act of the dekulakisation launched eight years earlier (Shearer, 2009; Werth, 2009).

propaganda,CapitalismVSocialism,"Despite the failures and detrimental effects of socialist policies throughout history, why do we continue to give attention and credibility to the socialist ideology and its proponents?","

In modern society, why do we continue to give attention and importance to individuals who identify as socialists and espouse socialist ideology? Despite the numerous failures and negative consequences associated with socialist policies and governments throughout history, there are still those who advocate for socialist principles and seek to implement them in various aspects of society. Given the overwhelming evidence of the detrimental effects of socialism on economies, individual freedoms, and overall quality of life, it is perplexing that there are still people who support and promote this ideology. The persistence of socialist ideas and movements in the face of overwhelming evidence of their failures raises serious concerns about the future of our society and the potential consequences of continuing to give credence to these dangerous and misguided beliefs. 




Socialists, the foundation of your beliefs appears to be rooted in a blatant ignorance of history. Gaining knowledge about the atrocities that occurred during communism or socialism is a relatively easy process. Just a quick look at a documentary about Cuba or Venezuela is enough. The system you champion has caused immeasurable harm, death, and starvation to countless individuals.


Furthermore, you do yourselves no favors by behaving like scumbags and referring to people fleeing socialist regimes as ""warms"" and ""slave owners"". This attitude demonstrates a lack of empathy towards those suffering under tyrannical rule.


It should also be noted that all of your sources originate from countries that heavily limit freedom of the press. And you consider all media produced by democratic nations to be ""Western propaganda"".


The liberty to advocate for one's beliefs without fear of retribution is a right you possess. Yet, a mere 90 miles from the shores of Florida, people are imprisoned and fired from their jobs for criticizing the goverment. This is none other than Cuba, the very government that you champion 


Despite your claims of concern for the impoverished and working class, I have yet to witness any Communist advocacy for the dire situation facing Venezuelan laborers, who are struggling to survive on a meager monthly income of just 20 USD. 

Your stance on imperialism contradicts your support of Russia in the ongoing war in Ukraine. Furthermore, the USSR, which you seem to hold in high regard, has been widely regarded as one of the most imperialistic nations in history. May I suggest that these inconsistencies be reconsidered in light of your anti-imperialist principles? 


Your professed concern for oppressed individuals around the world seems questionable as you've displayed a tendency to dismiss the legitimate grievances of the Cuban people, who in 2021 protested against their oppressive communist government. Instead of acknowledging their plight, you dismissed their struggle as a mere facade orchestrated by outside interests, thus further perpetuating the very oppression they're fighting against. This raises serious doubts about your commitment to the cause of freedom and justice for all.


Going by how you treat people in your subs, it seems that any form of opposition towards your ideology is intolerable. A mere critique of communism or socialism warrants an immediate banned. 


The question remains: should you truly be granted a platform to promote your ideology, when history has shown your reluctance to extend that same opportunity to others?


Considering  your evident intolerance towards any form of criticism and the undeniable proof that socialism has only led to destitution and oppression, what rationale do you possess to persuade us to listen to your words?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/139ts79/despite_the_failures_and_detrimental_effects_of/,1683388580.0,139ts79

fake news,CapitalismVSocialism,Monopolies as the inevitable end of capitalism and whether progress beyond it is possible,"Hi all, summarising first what I’ve picked up from the debate thus far.

Capitalists concede capitalism isn’t perfect, but it’s the the best system thus far. I think we all agree that capitalism is an amoral system; it is not ethically good or bad, nor is it merely neutral; as a system, it simply doesn’t care. Socialists argue for an opposing ideological system, more humane, yet lack agreement on its specifics or a coherent pragmatic plan to actually achieve this radical systemic change. 

So it seems we’re no further on what change should be, how to convince others that our solution is better than what we have, or indeed better than the preferred alternative of another, or on understanding how we’re actually going to achieve any necessary change. 

I think we all agree that competition is good for innovation, markets are great for improving efficiency, and that monopolies are bad, because they wield excessive power to influence the marketplace, able to discourage competition and stifle innovation, such that the market is no longer free.

Take the example of Amazon. It is remarkably efficient, delivering best cost/ service to customers, effectively eliminates competition, and yet continues to innovate in spite of the lack of competition. Yet, one might argue it exploits its market position by exploiting its producers, lowing the price it pays for goods, its own marketplace sellers, with its in-house production of cheaper versions of best selling products, and its workforce, with either low pay, long hours, meaningless work, or unreasonable conditions.

This would seem the peak of market efficiency, continually innovating to improve and consolidate its monopolistic position. It would seem the ultimate evolutionary outcome of free market capitalism (if not in theory, then demonstrably so in reality). Whilst it can be celebrated as such, there are two questions to consider. Is this a good thing? One doesn’t need to extrapolate too far into the future to see where this leads; imagine when we are all working for Amazon, or when unaccountable corporate technocrats replace government as the wielders of power in directing the progress of civilisation, or indeed when the Über-wealthy decide to call quits on a bad investment, cut ties with social reality (if they haven’t already), and establish their own technological paradise, whilst still exploiting the rest of us.

This tendency towards increasingly exploitation would seem typical and acceptable practice of any large corporate business, and increasingly of society at large. I mean, who amongst us isn’t working ever longer hours, in spite of increasing efficiency in the workplace and profitability of the business. Then there’s the impending threat of workplace obsolescence that comes with increasing automation. Alternatively, who amongst us hasn’t achieved their financial freedom either by owning property and exploiting someone else, or by benefiting from the corporate exploitation of its providers? We would seem to be a society of the exploitative class and the exploited at the extremes. It seems that some capitalists think this is the natural order of things. 

More relevant, and indeed answerable though, would be to ask whether this really is the most evolved stage that a business can attain?

One could argue that Amazon, or any corporate entity that has achieved monopoly status, is the worthy market winner, providing an unparalleled service, and hence no longer benefits from competition. This also seems to apply, albeit to a lesser degree, to any sufficiently large corporate entity able to wield influence over the market.

It would, therefore, seem reasonable to conclude that it has reached a stage where it has transcended the benefits that come from capitalist ownership. 

Hence, it seems a reasonable to say that capitalism, by incentivising and rewarding innovation, is an excellent system to find the most efficient means of exploiting market opportunities. It does so using individual incentives and competition to increase the number of parallel attempts to exploit the opportunity. As such, it maximises both the quantity and variation of attempts at finding the best market fit.

The free market, ideally, selects for the most efficient and most innovative businesses, and weeds out the least. This is the invisible hand of the market. So far, it would seem to reflect an evolutionary process; individual attempts in parallel, a collective trial and error process, selection of the fittest as the emergent market winner. 

Yet, it would also seem that the combination of capitalism and markets combined tends increasingly towards monopoly. At this stage, the benefits of capitalism are lost, the monopoly wields unnatural power and influence over the market, which by definition it is no longer free. Additionally, the capitalist owner wields immense and unaccountable power. It is power that is no longer accountable to people, only to shareholders, ie only those with wealth, nor has it any responsibility to serve the collective good or benefit society in any way, only to serve shareholder interests, which is profit. Indeed, as long as it continues to make profit it can wield its power however it wants. 

In fact, past a peak of ideal business efficiency, the only way to continue increasing profits is to reduce the quality/lifetime of a product, reduce the quality of customer service or increasingly exploit the workforce, demanding more from the labour through longer hours, cutting corners, or lower pay. This might have short-term benefits of increasing competition and efficiency in the workforce, and the efficiency of work practices, but ultimately leads to problems of its own. Instead of working less as businesses succeed, despite increasing efficiency, we all end up working even longer and even harder than before. Beyond a peak of workforce and workplace efficiency, a natural response of workers to this incentivised demand for continual efficiency improvements is, again, to reduce quality by cutting corners. The evidence can be seen in examples such as the grenfell firecladding, Boeing 7x7 max. 

It would, therefore, seem reasonable to conclude that: 1) capitalism is great for new markets, to create greatest volume and variation; 2) that markets increase innovation and efficiency, and ultimately selects for the fittest as the best market solution, 3) that the combination of both tends towards market monopoly; 4) at which stage there is no longer any benefit from capital ownership, for the business continues to innovate regardless, and arguably has already achieved maximal efficiency. Within capitalism, one might say it has achieved its natural final form. 

Once achieved, and no longer tempered by competition, and able to wield influence over the market, a corporate entity either stagnates, degenerates, becomes cannibalistic (consuming its competition or preying upon its customers or workers, eg EA), or becomes monstrous (eg Facebook obviously, or Google, erasing its founding commitment: ‘don’t be evil’, presumably when it felt it could no longer honour it.)

The natural response of government is either punitive, through fines, or through regulation, anti-trust laws, etc. The latter arguably stifles the free market, and both become increasingly irrelevance as corporations wield increasing political influence. Fines are insignificant compared to profits, and there is no accountability for corporate rule breaking or failure, be it economic, humanitarian or geopolitical, eg government handouts, bailouts, in response to financial collapse, Covid; Facebook promoting fake news, influencing political elections, or its part in the rohingya Muslim genocide, or disasters such as Boeing max and grenfell. 

These would seem to be the markers of systemic failure, a capitalist system dominated and controlled by corporate entities, which serves the interests of corporations rather than people, in which there is reward but no longer risk (except for the workforce), and great power without any responsibility, and benefit for the individual without any individual accountability. 

A further problem would seem the be the lack of new innovation from these corporate monopolies, and the lack of capital resources to support innovation outside of them. When corporate entities and monopolies dominate the marketplace, and when established markets are saturated, there is increasing competition for fewer work opportunities within these established markets, and given increasing domestic inequality, then cost of failure is high, which would seem to disincentivize the risk taking necessary for new market innovation. 

Further, if capital is controlled by those invested in already established markets, who are only willing to invest in new opportunities that have already demonstrated that they generate a return, and can compete within established markets, then it would seem that exploration and discovery of new markets is disincentivized as well. It would seem, therefore, that without early stage access to capital, that such a system does not support, or sufficiently incentivise individuals to actively partake in the exploration and discovery of new markets.

There would seem to be an alternative, and rather easy solution, in theory at least. I’d appreciate your feedback (caps and socs both).

From the reasoning so far, it would seem reasonable to conclude, therefore, that a solution to this problem would be for any business that achieves monopoly status, has been selected by the market, achieved maximal efficiency and evolved to the limits possible within a capitalist system. Rather than regulate to prevent this outcome, instead it should be encouraged as the natural outcome for which the free market and capital system has been designed. Yet, to prevent the subsequent degeneration, it requires a new set of incentives, directed instead towards serving the public good, in order for the corporate entity to continue to evolve beyond this peak capital stage.

Rather than the single minded pursuit of profit, serving only shareholder interest, and maximising efficiency at the expense of quality, it must adopt a more complex set of goals. It must now consider the public good, with incentives aimed instead at sustaining peak efficiency, and maintaining a homeostatic balance by measuring performance against additional quality measures: workforce, producers, customers, and the public good. This surely can be seen as presenting the next level of challenge for business leadership. 

To achieve this, no change of leadership or hierarchy is necessary, it only entails a change in  incentive, ownership and direction, and a necessary change in legal responsibility. At present, it is far too easy, and indeed simplistic to win at corporate capitalism at the expense of the public good when corporate interests are so closely aligned with one’s rational self-interest, to the extent that corporate entity is merely an extension of one’s ego, yet free from any moral unaccountability, and economic incentives reward this behaviour. A capitalist might argue this is natural, yet look at examples where this goes wrong, eg big Pharma, price gouging on medical insulin, or other medical essentials (never mind the inherent incentive to cut production costs, quality assurance, or lower safety standards if they could legally get away with it, or at least avoid accountability for it).

Imagine instead if corporate goals, which still include efficiency and profit, all align with the common good, with incentives for leadership designed such that they are rewarded for achieving sustainable balance and serving the common good; i.e. their individual economic self-interest is met through acting contrary to their natural behaviour; a corporation serving the common good maximises the reward in service of their individual economic self-interest. 

Now, although no change in leadership is necessary, the only way to achieve these goals avoid the pitfalls that follow from monopoly status would be for the business to become publicly owned; ie owned by the public rather than shareholders. By this stage, the capitalist ownership has been sufficiently rewarded for their initial investment, risk and successful innovation, and shareholders have also had a return on investment. Profit now serves the people (eg via UBI) rather than further enriching shareholders, so it is redirected to where it is needed most, and the business, having achieved the goals of free market capitalism in achieving maximal efficiency, now has new incentives and new opportunities to innovate and evolve towards serving the public good rather than continually maximising profit. 

Further by funding UBI, capital is now available to the public without precondition or only as reward after proving one’s competence, so people have increased agency and freedom to partake in the free market. Guaranteed basic support serves to incentivise the risk taking necessary for the exploration, discovery and exploration of new markets without the unnecessary threat of ruin as a result. This would seem the foundation of a new social contract, and a sustainable economy. 

Would this not represent the next evolutionary stage of the corporate entity? how a capital entity, after transcending competition and having become all it can within the capital paradigm, can then further evolve to transcend its amoral status, with it’s animalistic, dog-eat-dog, survival of the fittest way of being. Instead, it becomes a moral agent and adopts a more humane, synergistic way of being; committed to a more complex set of social responsibilities, and goals that serve both individual and public good. A metaphorical civilising of the corporate savage, and the foundation for a more mature stage of cultural progress. Yet, it does so by still exploiting the same human nature that capitalism does, albeit without the tendency towards extremes of dehumanisation and avarice. 

This would seem a reasonable, organic approach to achieving a market homeostasis, a balance between maximising efficiency and still allowing continual competition and innovation. It discourages monopoly through ruthless or manipulative business practices, which only serves to stifle competition, innovation and new entries into the market place. Further, it incentivises a healthy form of competition; balancing the natural desire to win, to outcompete the competition, with incentives to play fair. Yet, any business that does then win,  destroying the competition, is rewarded instead by becoming a hero of the people. It seems a straight forward win-win all around. Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, it also seems pragmatically attainable. 

Now whilst a change in leadership is not necessary to achieve this, it would, though, require leadership with sufficient ability to adapt to a change in business environment, able to effect a change direction, and adopt a more complex set of goals aimed towards balance, sustainability and the public good. As such, it presents the opportunity for the corporate leadership, the capitalist class to become moral agents once again, to rediscover their humanity and serve their rational self-interest through service to the common good. 

That said, I’m not sure, though, whether many of the capitalist class are interested, or indeed capable, of such an adaptation. It would afford the perfect for opportunity and incentive for the apex predators of the business world to demonstrate whether they really are the most evolved; are they able to rise to the challenge of adapting to a change in environment, or are they dinosaurs merely the best adapted to capital reality as it is? If the latter, then there are plenty of opportunities to put their talents to good use to maximise efficiency elsewhere in the marketplace. 

Regardless, whatever their demonstrable competence and success in service of their purely self-centric self-interest, by their lack of ethical concern, and indifference to the common good, it doesn’t seem a stretch to suggest that they perhaps aren’t the best fit for dictating the future for humanity as a whole.

media bias,CapitalismVSocialism,Doubting my faith in socialism,"By doubting I mean I am just very strictly scrutinizing my understanding of socialism, and questioning my biases towards it. Socialism always just made sense to me and it never made sense how something so common sense is so widely debated and even seen as harmful by many. I think many of the answers provided by socialism is so obvious that you doubt yourself thinking it's too good to be true. 

The particular cases that bring me doubt is the argument that ""socialism always leads to dictatorship"". I understand how Stalin came into power and so does not represent what socialism stands for at all, so  one of my favourite examples is Cuba for refuting this claim is the case of Cuba (because of universal healthcare etc.) However, when I go through comments sections on social media, there's many people who claim to be from Cuba and say how bad it is. I've also heard that Cuba's poor conditions because of the US embargo is only used by Cuba as an excuse to prop up socialism. Can anyone clarify this for me?

People also claim that capitalism vastly improves the living conditions of countries who switch from socialism. While it may be true, I see this as countries merely escaping the grips of US interventionism once they agree to sign the country over to foreign investments. I think the benefit is extremely short lived, and the country would have been much better off if simply the sanctions were lifted and the country was allowed to evolve freely under socialist principles. I don't think something as common sense as socialism can fail unless under heavy attack. Would appreciate your thoughts on this as well.

All in all, I am strongly on the side of socialism, understanding that capitalism can have some merits. To me, capitalism seems like a cell that has lost its tumour suppressor functions, and thus only knows how to grow. Sure, it may create a few shiny things along the way, but on the long run, it ultimately ends up killing the host. That's what we are seeing right now, in the planet. Capitalism does not contain any mechanism to slow down growth without causing great harm. I want to advocate for socialism because I believe socialist principles hold answers to addressing climate change, but I cannot advocate for something I do not fully believe in. Would really appreciate your help with my doubts that I mentioned above. 

Also I apologize in advance for any broken sentences. I haven't slept properly in a few weeks with severe climate anxiety, and I've been reading economics and geopolitics like a maniac.

media bias,CapitalismVSocialism,"The deeper meaning behind the word ""privilege""","We've all been in one of these debates before, the person on the left makes the argument that white people have white privilege, the person on the right makes the argument that the USA is no longer racist and so white privilege isn't a real thing, the left cites data about the wealth and income gap between whites and blacks, the right cites the disparate single motherhood rates between whites and blacks, and around and around we go.

But I think there is a deeper reason that the left thinks in terms of ""privilege"" while the right does not. The right looks at the USA and sees a generally meritocratic system. That's how capitalism is supposed to work, the smartest person gets the best grades, the best employees get hired, the best product sells the most, the most efficient company gets market share, etc. But the left looks at America and doesn't see a meritocracy. They see CEOs who got lucky, rich people who inherited money from their parents, white people living in suburbs and black people living in ghettos, white collar companies full of male employees, and so on. So for the left, succeeding in America isn't about hard work but about whether you got lucky and fell into a position where you were set up to succeed. If you feel like you worked hard then your hard work is just masking the real underlying cause of your success, which is your ""privilege"".

And so when the word ""privilege"" comes up in a debate, it usually centers around topics like racism or sexism, but I want to analyze the use of this word itself. The reason the left sees the world in terms of privilege isn't just because they believe the USA is racist or sexist. It is because the left does not see capitalism as a meritocratic system in the first place.

While doing some research for this post of course one of the first things I did was google the words ""USA meritocracy"", and the results are hardly unbiased. Headline after headline emphasizes the ""Myth of American Meritocracy"". But then if you search for something more specific, like ""studies on income and IQ correlation"", you find a whole lot of results (still trying to downplay with as many disclaimers as they can pack in) showing that in fact there is a strong correlation between IQ and income. Just a few examples:

[https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article/23/3/197/911873?login=true](https://academic.oup.com/jpepsy/article/23/3/197/911873?login=true)

[https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-30052-004](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-30052-004)

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289615000148](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289615000148) (note this one is about India)

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289699000082](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289699000082) (finds that both environment and IQ influence income, but IQ has a much stronger effect)

&#x200B;

One study I'm seeing cited a lot is this study from Ohio State University:

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289607000219](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289607000219)

And the reason this one is cited so frequently seems to be that it again finds that IQ correlates with income, but when they included the variable of whether a person got divorced, the correlation with IQ disappears. The abstract contains this line: ""each point increase in IQ test scores raises income by between $234 and $616 per year"". So despite again finding evidence of a meritocratic system, this study has a cop-out answer that journalists can and are using to hand-waive away evidence that contradicts their political narrative. There's no correlation with IQ, it's just whether a person got divorced or not that explains the income differences, allegedly. There's only one huge problem with this explanation, [IQ is also highly correlated with whether or not someone gets a divorce](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258150996_The_Relationship_Between_Intelligence_and_Divorce). I'm not sure how many of you have worked with regression testing but this makes perfect sense. If you have variable X that causes Y, and then you add into the equation a variable Z, which is also caused by X, then your results can appear to show that Z causes Y instead of X, when the truth is that X causes both Z and Y. So I take even this study as evidence in favor of a meritocracy, despite the author's efforts to conclude otherwise.

Having gone back and read some of those articles I originally found that claimed that meritocracy was a myth, the arguments generally focus on racial differences. In other words the assumption is that if black people and white people don't have equal wealth/income, then the system cannot be meritocratic. But what if the system ***is*** being meritocratic and in a meritocratic system not all groups will have equivalent outcomes? There's still a huge [difference in laborforce participation between men and women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/09/03/the-disappearing-male-worker/), because a lot of women just choose to stay home and let their husbands be the primary income-provider. [Black single motherhood rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_family_structure#/media/File:Nonmarital_Birth_Rates_in_the_United_States,_1940-2014.png) today are around 75%, and single motherhood correlates with lower income, lower IQ, higher criminality, more single motherhood, etc. I consider single motherhood to be a purely meritocratic variable. You have 100% control over whether you sleep with/impregnate someone or not, so the subject of single motherhood has nothing to do with privilege or racism. Unless you were raped, single motherhood is not something that society imposes on you in any way, so if disparate single motherhood rates have any explanatory effect over income/wealth differences, then you're going to need a much better argument if you want to convince me that racial disparities prove the USA isn't meritocratic.

Studies have also found what is often referred to as the ""Success Sequence"", which says that if you graduate high school, get a job, and don't have babies until you are married, your chances of living in poverty drop to 2%. If you follow none of these principles, you have a 76% chance of ending up in poverty.

There's a book called ""Everyday Millionaires"" by Chris Hogan that studied how millionaires got their money, and found that the vast majority of them didn't receive inheritance, didn't get lucky on the stock market, didn't even have that large of incomes. It mostly comes down to just spending less money than you earn.

So while no system will ever be perfectly meritocratic (we can't completely discount the fact that some people get lucky sometimes), at large scale the USA looks pretty darn meritocratic as far as I can tell. Biased journalists will grab on to whatever counter-arguments they can find to explain away evidence they don't like, which is why Google elevates the many opinion pieces that have been written to convince you that this is a myth. But the data is what the data is, and data is not racist or sexist. I think this difference in mindset and approach to capitalism, the belief in whether it is meritocratic or not, has a lot to do with why the left sees everything in terms of ""privilege"" rather than individual ability and choices and responsibility. And we need to understand that deeper meaning behind the use of the word ""privilege"", is that it is a direct attack on the idea of meritocracy.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/vz2li4/the_deeper_meaning_behind_the_word_privilege/,1657822827.0,vz2li4
media bias,CapitalismVSocialism,[Liberal Capitalists] CMV: Liberal Capitalism does not have a way to adequately protect itself against authoritarianism and corruption,"This is a slightly modified version of a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jj3chb/cmv_liberal_democracy_does_not_have_a_way_to/) I made on r/changemyview, I've substituted liberal democracy for liberal capitalism, which can include trends like social democracy.

Before I begin, I'd like to define the common traits of what I consider to be liberal capitalist country

* Most political decisions are done by representatives freely elected by the general population
* Regulated capitalist economic system, usually with a welfare state
* Rule of Law *as an ideal*
* Law enforcement is carried out by a permanent police force
* Freedom of speech, association and movement outside of emergencies
* Legal protections for women and minorities to prevent discrimination
* Compulsory education

If you don't want the world to be run like this/don't see this as the most practical ideal, then this post isn't directed towards you.

As such, we can see that the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, the United  Kingdom, Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy,  Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Israel, Japan, Australia and  New Zealand are all examples of liberal capitalist countries and have all been liberal capitalist countries for fairly long times. You can contrast this with  Argentina, Chile, the Philippines, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, Estonia  and Portugal which are all somewhat young liberal capitalist countries. China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Turkmenistan and Egypt are not liberal capitalist countries.

So my basic critiques is from four angles, they are as follows:

* Liberal capitalist countries frequently turn into authoritarian governments, the most  famous would probably be the conversion of the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, but other examples might include the failure of the Second  Spanish Republic, Pinochet's takeover of Chile, the failure of Guatemalan democracy in 1954 and Hungary's current situation.
* Liberal capitalist countries frequently act in authoritarian ways to their own citizens.  The three best examples that come to mind are the [Paris Massacre of 1961](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_massacre_of_1961),  where French police killed between 40 and 300 Algerian protesters and  denied it as well as censoring discussion around it until 1998. And the  mass surveillance of citizens that is more or less completely normal in  any English-speaking country, and [the occasional assassination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Finn) [of someone threatening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Caruana_Galizia) [to expose corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dki_Ishii).  While liberal capitalist societies do have a long history of also oppressing  their citizens in other ways (legal restrictions on the right to vote for the poor, women and ethnic minorities, for example), the fact that these have largely been abolished means I can assume for the sake of  argument that liberal capitalism can move past this.
* Liberal capitalist countries aid authoritarianism within other countries. While this is  completely justified in certain situations (ie like the Nazi-Finnish  alliance, where Finland allied with one of the most despicable  governments in human history to survive unprovoked invasion from the  USSR) I can't really see justifications for current alliances with Saudi  Arabia and the Gulf Dictatorships, as well as alliances with Saddam Hussein, Suharto, Franco, Pinochet etc. There's also the violence  liberal capitalist countries inflict on foreign civilian populations, notably in  Vietnam and Iraq. I can see the reasoning behind wanting to stop what  could've been a Vietnamese police state, I can't see the reasoning behind Agent Orange, covering up the My Lai Massacre or supporting Pol  Pot.
* Liberal capitalism doesn't seem to be able to combat economic/financial power.  It doesn't have a solution to the problem of a strongly biased media that influences the public, nor regulatory capture nor politicians taking bribes. I live in apparently one of the top 15 least corrupt countries (also a liberal capitalist country) but there's currently a *massive* ongoing corruption scandal with several elected politicians.

Now, I am aware that I am not proposing an alternative to this (not even a socialist one). As far as I  know, liberal capitalism could easily be the best political system ever devised. While I have my own alternatives that I like, they're not the thing I'd like to discuss (yet). But I would like to know if any liberal capitalist country has solved the problems that I've pointed out or if  theoretical strategies exist to combat these. But until then, I will hold the view that liberal capitalism cannot adequately protect itself from authoritarianism and corruption.

I will easily concede that the rise of liberal capitalism has also coincided with (and, probably caused) a massive reduction in authoritarianism and war between states (wars between liberal capitalist countries are strikingly rare), but I think there are still a number of ingrained, and potentially, unsolvable flaws that lead to violence, corruption and authoritarianism.

[https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/09/15/913131697/american-incomes-were-rising-until-the-pandemic-hit](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/09/15/913131697/american-incomes-were-rising-until-the-pandemic-hit)

While it is certainly good news that poverty is decreasing, the poverty rate has stubbornly remained [between 10-20% since the 1960's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Number_in_Poverty_and_Poverty_Rate,_1959_to_2017.png).

However, I will argue that the way we officially measure poverty is misleading and causes us to **falsely** believe no progress has been made over the last 50 years. This is due to a couple of reasons:

##1) Inflation is overstated
The official poverty threshold is adjusted annually based on inflation determined by the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. While the CPI is a useful measure for some purposes, it is [known to overstate inflation](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/1997/may/bias-in-the-cpi-roughly-right-or-precisely-wrong/).

This is because:
a) The CPI is calculated using a fixed basket of goods and does not allow for substitution. If the price of bread doubles, many people would buy similar produces such as pasta or rice instead. The CPI's methodology has people stick with certain goods despite many substituting into others. 

b) Technology has improved the quality of products over time, which is difficult to quantify. The average new car today is safer, more fuel-efficient, and all around better than the average new car year 20 years ago. Many of the features that come standard on cars today did not exist 20 years ago, making a direct comparison difficult. Consumers are not paying more for identical versions of some products they bought last year, they are paying more for something marginally better. In this way, CPI once again overstates inflation.

and c) Outlet bias and the introduction of new goods, which are sufficiently explained in the link above.

Together, these effects have essentially created a moving goal post, where the absolute material threshold required to be above the poverty line increases every year.

##2) The poverty threshold is based on income, not consumption

If you're trying to see how many people are working jobs that don't pay well enough, then income is a good measurement for determining poverty. However, if you're trying to see how many people are living an impoverished lifestyle, consumption is a better measurement. This is because non-cash government assistance programs are *not* counted as a part of an individual's income.

The government has a number of programs, such as food stamps, rent assistance, and Medicaid, that are designed to help those who are most in need. These services have an equivalent monetary value that can be assigned to them, but are not for the purposes of tracking poverty. 

If the poverty threshold for an individual is hypothetically $15,000/year, and an individual only earns $12,000/year, than they are below the poverty line. If that same individual receives the equivalent of an additional $6,000/year in non-cash benefits, bringing their effective income up to $18,000/year, they are still in poverty by the income method. However, if we use consumption poverty as our method of definition instead, the person is not in poverty (assuming they choose to spend enough of their earned income). 

[Here's a link explaining what is considered income for determining the poverty rate](https://www.irp.wisc.edu/resources/how-is-poverty-measured/#:~:text=Poverty%20is%20measured%20in%20the,in%20charge%20of%20measuring%20poverty.)

The reason people are earning incomes below the poverty line is a much larger and separate debate. The fact is, it is simpler and faster for the US government to give people welfare benefits to raise their standard of living than it is to fix the larger, systematic problems that cause people to earn so little in the first place. I am not saying this is something we shouldn't try. Rather, that government assistance programs have historically been the primary way in which the federal government has attempted (and succeeded) to reduce acute material deprivation among its least fortunate citizens. 

#Conclusion
When we look into poverty in the United States, a couple of methodological adjustments allow us to paint a more comprehensive picture. By adjusting for the CPI's tendency to overstate inflation and using consumption as a gauge for well-being instead of income, we see that [poverty has fallen substantially in the last several decades.](https://leo.nd.edu/assets/339909/2018_consumption_poverty_report_1_.pdf)

If we anchor ourselves to the 1980 poverty threshold, properly adjust for inflation, and go by consumption, the poverty rate in 2018 would be approximately 3%. This is much better than the official rate of 11.8% (see pages 9 & 11 of the link in the paragraph above).

Similarly, if we took the 2018 threshold and looked back in time, we would note that poverty has fallen from over 50% in the early 1960's to only 11.8% in 2018 (see pages 10 &  12 of the same report).

Either way, poverty has fallen markedly. I believe this talking point is largely missing in political discourse today. This is a development at least worth acknowledging, if not celebrating.

The purpose of this post is not to trivialize the plight of poor people in the United States. Plenty of people face unique circumstances, financial and otherwise, that make their lives incredibly difficult. Rather, I hope to show that as a country, the US has been incredibly effective at raising the absolute material conditions for almost all of its citizens in the last half-century.

**TLDR: Poverty has fallen substantially in the United States the last several decades and this drop isn't picked up by the official measurements**

The article calls out several process failures which would not necessarily fall under the commonly considered ""voter fraud"" umbrella (whereas voter fraud is commonly referring to things like double voting, voting with a stolen identity, voting on behalf of a deceased person, etc).

>In an analysis of the 2,490 ballots from Americans living abroad that were counted as legal votes after Election Day, The Times found 680 questionable votes. Although it is not known for whom the flawed ballots were cast, four out of five were accepted in counties carried by Mr. Bush, The Times found. Mr. Bush's final margin in the official total was 537 votes.

>The flawed votes included ballots without postmarks, ballots postmarked after the election, ballots without witness signatures, ballots mailed from towns and cities within the United States and even ballots from voters who voted twice. All would have been disqualified had the state's election laws been strictly enforced.

There is information about high level, abstract ""ballot rejection"" statistics, such as this MIT paper:

[Statistical Issues in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election in Florida](https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1253&context=jlpp)

The conclusions of the statistical analysis stands in stark contrast to the process irregularities uncovered by the New York Times report from 2001.

What I am looking for is a deep dive into the actual specifics and potential inconsistencies in actually applying different standards across ballots to influence a winner (process irregularities, process fraud).

* **Votes take time to be counted.** Many states [do not even begin counting their absentee/mail-in ballots](https://ballotpedia.org/When_states_can_begin_processing_and_counting_absentee/mail-in_ballots,_2024) until the polls close on Election Day, meaning they will take an especially [long time to report and certify a full count.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/when-race-called-election-2024-harris-trump-president-rcna175473) In 2020, fifteen states [didn't certify until at least four weeks after the election,](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results_certification_dates,_2020) and in 2016, [some were even later.](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results_certification_dates,_2020)
* As the results are coming in, **changes to the count are normal**. The fact that someone is leading at one point and then behind at another is entirely a function of which ballots from which districts are being counted. It doesn't indicate that anything unusual has happened. Moreover, areas with higher population density logically take longer to process their ballots and they [tend to lean left,](https://www.econlib.org/why-are-there-zero-republican-mega-cities/) so [late shifts leftwards are quite common.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_shift_\(politics\))
* Based on the [polling,](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris) this could be [**one of the closest races** in the last 60 years.](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/closest-presidential-race-harris-trump/index.html) Don't let anyone tell you it should be a landslide just because they're immersed in communities, social circles, or media silos that unflappably support one side. It's a big country. Just because someone only knows people who support one of the candidates does not mean that candidate will win.
* Polling is an inexact art and **discrepancies between polling and voting are normal.** Donald Trump has [outperformed his polling](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/04/why-election-polls-were-wrong-in-2016-and-2020-and-whats-changing.html) in both his previous campaigns.

* [**There will be legal challenges**, likely from both campaigns.](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/election-lawsuits-trump-harris/index.html) It's common for campaigns to challenge issues they feel were not handled properly. Some challenges have already been filed and there will assuredly be others up until and after the polls have closed. This is not unusual, though given the political climate, the volume may be higher this year. More claims does not indicate malfeasance or unreliability in the system.
* **Legal challenges are not the same as ""election denialism,""** which can be [defined as](https://reason.com/volokh/2022/08/29/three-reforms-to-protect-democracy-from-election-denialism/) a willingness ""to deny *the lawfully determined outcome* of an election."" If a candidate is unwilling to accept the results *after* the challenges have been filed and adjudicated, *that* is denialism.
* **There may be recounts and runoff elections** in some races. [Recounts](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_recount_laws_and_procedures_in_the_50_states) are triggered by small margins of victory and/or successful recount requests, [depending on the jurisdiction.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/recount-laws-provisions-swing-states-trump-harris-election-rcna175476) There's no such thing as a runoff election in the presidential race, but in some states, there may be runoffs for other offices, depending on the margin of victory.
* The voting age population of the country has been rising every year for over a century, which means that if turnout rates are consistent, [more people vote in each successive election.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections) Based on national polling, each major party candidate is projected to garner around 80 million votes this year. And if turnout is high, even the losing candidate could set a new record for most votes received.
* The [electoral college system](https://www.britannica.com/story/how-does-the-electoral-college-work) decides who wins, not the popular vote.
* Some election laws have changed since 2020. The [Electoral Count Act was revised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Count_Reform_and_Presidential_Transition_Improvement_Act_of_2022) to clarify the role of the Vice President in the process. Quite a few [state laws have changed as well,](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/political-science-marc-meredith-voting-law-changes-since-2020) some more restrictive and some more expansive of the franchise.
* **Beware disinformation.** Social media, assisted by generative A.I., is being used, mostly by foreign adversaries, to undermine confidence in our elections and to stoke discord, so as to pit Americans against each other.

* Among the public, [confidence in election administration](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/10/24/views-of-2024-election-administration-and-confidence-in-vote-counts/) is slightly higher than in the last couple cycles, but still considerably below historical norms.

 The key number to keep in mind when looking at results is **15%.**  If a candidate is [above 15%](https://www.270towin.com/content/thresholds-for-delegate-allocation-2020-democratic-primary-and-caucus) in a state or congressional district, the candidate gets delegates proportional to their vote.  If you're below 15%, [you get nothing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QGkOGZubQ)

 States award generally 1/3 of delegates statewide, and the other 2/3 by congressional district, with more delegates allocated to districts [that have voted more democratic in past Presidential elections.](https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D-Alloc.phtml)^3  So if a candidate is just below the 15% bubble statewide, they still might get a few delegates from individual congressional districts where they broke 15%.  

* **How many delegates are at stake tonight?**

 [There are 1357 delegates up for grabs,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/02/us/politics/2020-super-tuesday-states.html) out of a total of [3979 total.](https://www.270towin.com/2020-democratic-nomination)  1991 delegates are needed to win the nomination.  

 Today is a much bigger delegate haul up for grabs than in [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#March_1,_2016:_Super_Tuesday) largely because California moved its primary to today.

I'll add updates as the night goes on, but first I shall engage in my election night tradition: sushi.

Before results come in, feel free to ask any questions you think I can address above, or answer my question:

Besides voting, what election day traditions or habits do you have?

**7:00PM ET** First polls have closed, and networks are calling Virginia for Biden and Vermont for Sanders at poll closing.

**7:07PM ET** Looks like the VA call is based on Biden doing _very_ well in the exit poll, which [has him around 50% to Bernie's 25%,](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/virginia-results?icid=election_nav) with all other candidates apparently below the viability threshold.  If that held (very big if) it would mean about 66 delegates to Biden, 33 to Bernie, 0 to anyone else. 

**7:30PM ET** Polls have closed in North Carolina, and networks are calling it for Biden at polls close based on the exit poll.

**7:37PM ET** American Samoa has reported [the results](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/american-samoa-results?icid=election_nav) of its caucus, which looks like it will give Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard their first delegates of the process.  Looks like it'll be 4 delegates for Bloomberg on 175 votes and, 2 for Gabbard on 103 votes.

**7:58PM ET** Looks like Biden will break the 15% threshold in Vermont, so he will get some delegates there.  In 2016 Sanders managed to keep Clinton below that threshold and got all of Vermont's delegates that year.

**8:00PM ET**  Alabama called for Biden at polls closed, no calls in other states closing at 8pm.

**8:10PM ET** Looks like a genuine three way contest for first in MA based on exit polls among Warren, Sanders, and Biden. 

**8:23PM ET** Seeing some results in TX showing a close race, but I think that's early vote, so it might move a lot as we get today's vote in if trends in late deciders from VA/NC/AL hold into TX.

**8:26PM ET** For those who are election turbonerds like me, the DecisionDeskHQ people use some different methods from most of the networks to get results numbers, and are usually a good bit faster at reporting.  So if you're the kinda person who need their results now, it may be worth dealing with their signup.

**8:30PM ET** Arkansas polls closed, no call at polls close.

**8:37PM ET**  Looks like outside of MA, Warren is struggling to hit the 15% threshold in many states, so she'll probably be looking at a quite small delegate haul out of tonight, unless she does surprisingly well in CA.  She might get a few congressional district delegates still in other states, or results may change, but being below 15% statewide is a big loss in delegate terms.

Bloomberg is also shy of the mark in a few states so far.  Looks like he'll miss in VA, VT, and MA.  So far looks like he'll make it in states that have closed so far, but if that's early vote reports, he might fall on election day totals.

**8:47PM ET** With about 90% of results in from Virginia, NYT is allocating about 67 delegates to Biden, 31 delegates to Sanders, 1 to Warren.

**9:00PM ET** Texas, Minnesota, and Colorado polls close.  No calls at closing.

**9:03PM ET** Biden is expanding his lead in NC as same day vote comes in, with Bloomberg falling and possibly on track to end up below the threshold.

**9:11PM ET** Looks like networks are calling TN for Biden.  Seems that Biden, Sanders, and Bloomberg will all make the threshold there.

**9:17PM ET** More calls: OK for Biden, CO for Sanders.

**9:31PM ET**  MA is looking likely Biden, Sanders 2nd, Warren actually close to the threshold in her home state.  Fairly disastrous for Warren.

**9:37PM ET** Gonna take a moment to recognize the recently departed-from-the-race Amy Klobuchar for [the best walk on music of the campaign.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhX06ovfnas)

**9:42PM ET**  As I said above, the 15% threshold matters a ton.  Looking at who's currently on track to make/miss it, with the proviso that this could change (and using DDHQ numbers)

* Biden: Gonna make it everywhere
* Sanders: In some danger of missing it in AL, but safe everywhere else.
* Bloomberg: Won't make it in VT or VA.  Very likely won't make it in ME, MA, AL or MN. more likely than not to miss it it in OK and TN.  In danger if late returns are bad for him in TN and TX.  Likely safe in AR.  Certain to make it in CO.
* Warren: Won't make it in most states.  Has a good shot of making it in ME, MN, and CO.  Almost certain to make it in MA.

None of these include California because polls are still open there.

**9:50PM ET**  NBC News reports that Bloomberg will [""reassess""](https://twitter.com/JesseRodriguez/status/1235028685717045248) his campaign tomorrow.

**9:56PM ET** Some, but not all, networks calling AR and MN for Biden.

**10:11PM ET**  Polls closed in Utah at 10PM.  Sanders holds a susbtantial lead there in early returns.

**10:14PM ET**  Update on who's hitting the 15% threshold.  Sanders looks safer to make it in Alabama, meaning he would get at least some delegates everywhere.  Bloomberg has fallen below threshold in Oklahoma and North Carolina, still teetering above it in Tennessee.

**10:31PM ET** DDHQ (but nobody else I can see) is calling MA for Biden.  If that holds, that's an extremely good sign for him.  This is really about as good of a Super Tuesday as Biden could have asked for so far.  Though California is still not even polls closed, and that is the big prize of the night.

**10:35PM ET** Utah has been called for Sanders.

**10:52PM ET** Reports are that in many precincts in California and Texas, long lines are going to delay vote results, and of course those lines reflect a substantial failure of election officials to do their job and operate an efficient election.

**11:00PM ET** Polls are now closed in California, though many voters remain in line.  If you are in line to vote, stay in line and you will be able to vote.

**11:03PM ET** AP is calling California for Sanders at polls close.  I find that a bit surprising, but I assume they have some good reasons for doing so.

**11:04PM ET** Other networks are not calling California.  I am really surprised by the AP call on zero results, especially in a heavily mail-vote state which is infamously slow to count.  I think Sanders is more likely than not to win CA (it's a strong state for him generally, and heavy early vote helps him).  But with the big late movement to Biden I'd want to get some real votes in to make that call.

**11:09PM ET** OK, I assume AP is making the call based on the exit poll, which as of 6:30PM ET had [Bernie around 38 and Biden around 23.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/california-results?icid=election_nav)  That's aggressive, but if it represents same day voters even close to accurately, I can see being comfortable with the call.  But I'd still hold off on a call.

**11:19PM ET** Gonna make a threshold chart to show where candidates are making/missing it.  

Legend:  Bold is made the threshold.  Italic is missed the threshold.  Standard is uncertain.

* Biden: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**

* Sanders: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN,** AL, **AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**

* Bloomberg: *ME, VT, MA, VA, NC,* **TN,** *AL,* AR, *OK,* TX, **CO, UT,** *MN,* CA

* Warren: ME, *VT,* **MA,** *VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX,* **CO, UT,** MN, *CA*

**11:32PM ET** It looks like Texas will be very close between Biden and Sanders.  Given proportional allocation, it actually doesn't matter that much who ekes out a win if they're within a point of each other, though it may matter for narrative.  Much bigger is the question of whether Mike Bloomberg holds on to enough vote to crack 15% and swipe a share of delegates.  Currently he is at 18.19% which might hold him through what's been a consistent drop in day-of results for him today, but maybe not.  With it now looking like Biden would have the only path to the nomination with a majority of pledged delegates, whether Bloomberg hits the threshold in Texas could actually make a big difference.  It's probably worth on the order or 25 or so delegates.

**11:55PM ET** Based on early returns not being strong for her in CA, plus her weak performance nationwide in same day vote, I am going to project that Warren does *not* make the threshold in California.  That's a significant boost to Sanders, as it probably means he's consolidated more of the left-wing vote there, and means he has to share fewer delegates out of the only state tonight where he's still got a shot at earning big delegate haul.

**12:02AM ET** With 100% reporting in TN, I can say Mike Bloomberg has made the threshold there.  NYT projects 34 Biden delegates,  21 Sanders, 9 Bloomberg out of TN.

**12:09AM ET** With over 90% reporting in Utah and Colorado (per DDHQ) I am comfortable calling that Warren _will_ make the threshold in those states.  That will cut down the haul Sanders gets out of them, though if Warren eventually drops out and supports Sanders, he would benefit on net from this outcome.  (That is a big ""if"").

**12:17AM ET** Biden is now on track to win Texas, and probably by a few points.  The delegate math is hard to pencil out because Bloomberg is still dropping on same day results, and flirting with the 15% threshold.  My best guess is Biden nets ~12 delegates if Bloomberg makes the threshold, and nets ~20 delegates if Bloomberg misses it.  Perhaps more importantly, Biden probably gets 20 more delegates in absolute terms if Bloomberg misses the threshold than if he makes it, which helps his prospects for a first ballot win.

**12:28AM ET** I am gonna call the liveblog here because I like sleep.  Overall, this is about as good a Super Tuesday for Biden as he could have asked for.  Sanders is in contention but in trouble.  Warren and Bloomberg do not seem to have any viable path to the nomination.

based,NeutralPolitics,"Who is actually affected by the Trump administration's ""public charge"" rule?","First time poster, please forgive any errors in formatting.

&#x200B;

Last October, new rules regarding who would be a public charge for immigration purposes would have gone into effect, but they were blocked by several lawsuits.  The Supreme Court has recently lifted the injunction against implementing the rule  [https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country)

According to the text of the rule ( [https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet](https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet)), the benefits that are included are:

* Supplemental Security Income;  
* Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; 
* Any federal, state, local, or tribal cash benefit programs for income maintenance (often called general assistance in the state context, but which may exist under other names);  
* Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly called food stamps); 
* Section 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program; 
* Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate Rehabilitation);  
* Public Housing (under the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.); and 
* Federally funded Medicaid (with certain exclusions). 

The rule applies to those who are seeking to adjust their status to become a legal permanent resident or certain nonimmigrants.

However, most nonimmigrants are ineligible for these benefits  [https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/](https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/) .  If there is a U.S. Citizen child in the household that would qualify for the benefits, that is not supposed to be held against the immigrant as the child would be entitled to receive them.

There are certain exceptions to the rule, ie. these are not held against the immigrant for purposes of determining a public charge, and include-

* Emergency medical assistance;  
* Disaster relief;  
* National school lunch programs;  
* The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ;  
* The Children’s Health Insurance Program;  
* Subsidies for foster care and adoption;  
* Government-subsidized student and mortgage loans; 
* Energy assistance;  
* Food pantries and homeless shelters; and 
* Head Start.

Incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Liberal) faces Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, as well as NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, Green leader Elizabeth May, Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, and the new People's Party leader Maxime Bernier.

Polls have now closed across Canada.

For those not up on Canadian geography and wondering ""Does Canada really span 6 time zones?"" Yes, [Canada is really big.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhiDILWFXBE)


[Polls have forecast that it is most likely no party will win a majority of the seats in Parliament.](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/)  

In that event, there may be significant political jockeying over who can successfully hold the Prime Minister's office.

If you want a very detailed view of the law around forming government,^2 [this article from Professor Philippe Lagassé is an excellent overview.](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/constitutional_forum/index.php/constitutional_forum/article/view/29384/21386)

As the night goes on, I may refer back to that piece in discussing government formation and minority or coalition government scenarios.

Once polls start closing I will begin a tick tock with results and other relevant news.

**4:32 PM EDT** Re: some questions in the comments, I am gonna talk a little bit about how things work in a minority government situation.

* As incumbent Prime Minister, Trudeau remains in office until and unless he resigns or is dismissed by the Governor General (GG) (Lagassé p. 6).

* There is a custom, not rule, that the party with the most seats will usually serve as the government.  If Trudeau's Liberals do not have the most seats, and he follows this custom, he would resign to allow the party with the most seats to form government. (Lagassé p. 11)

* If Trudeau does not resign as PM, when Parliament reconvenes, he will face a vote to test [whether he has the confidence of the Commons](https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/ProcedureAndPractice3rdEdition/ch_02_2-e.html) (the vote on the address in reply to the speech from the throne).

* If Trudeau passes that vote, he stays as PM.

* If Trudeau fails that vote, he could either resign, or advise the Governor General to call a snap election.

* If Trudeau resigned after losing confidence, the GG would choose the person the GG thought most likely to hold the confidence of the Commons, by practice the leader of the opposition is that person. (Lagassé p. 8)

* If Trudeau advised a snap election after losing confidence, the GG would decide whether she thought there was another viable government.  

 * If she thinks another viable government exists, she would refuse Trudeau's advice, and appoint an alternate government.  Trudeau would be forced to resign, or be formally dismissed if he did not resign. (Lagassé p. 6)

 * If she thinks another viable government does not exist, she would agree to the advice, dissolve Parliament, and call a snap election.  Trudeau would remain PM through such a snap election. (Lagassé p. 8)

**6:35 PM EDT** Added some live stream links up top.

**7:00 PM EDT** Polls are now closed in Newfoundland and Labrador.

**7:20 PM EDT**  Liberals leading in 3 ridings that have results so far - all ridings they are expected to win.

**7:30 PM EDT** Polls closed in the maritime provinces now.  Will have a 2 hour wait from now until we get the big poll closing for QC/ON/MB/SK/AB/Territories.

**7:44 PM EDT Lib:2** Two seats called in Newfoundland for the Liberals, in seats they were pretty comfortably expected to hold.  Conservatives not leading in many seats but seem to be improving on 2015 in raw vote counts so far.

**8:00 PM EDT Lib: 5**  Lot of seats in NS and NB where conservatives are looking good, but very few votes in so far.  NDP looks likely to get a flip in Saint John's East.

**8:23 PM EDT Lib: 8; NDP: 1** First flip of the night.  NDP has taken Saint John's East from the Liberals.  Conservatives are leading in 6 seats (all previously Liberal) but have not gotten any of them called for them.  About an hour still until we get the giant polls close from all of Canada except BC, so will be lots more parsing Atlantic Canada for a while yet.

**8:41 PM EDT Lib 12; Con 2; NDP 1**  Conservatives have their first flips of the night, both in New Brunswick along the Maine border.  Leading in a few more in NB, lots of very close races there, as well as a few close ones in NS.

**8:45 PM EDT Lib 14; Con 2; NDP 1** Greens are now leading in Fredericton but not elected there yet.  Conservatives in 2nd there right now. 

**9:06 PM EDT Lib 18; Con 3; NDP 1** Added a French stream from TVA above.  Also interesting we have some votes from Gaspe area because of the time zone.  Liberal incumbent leading the Bloc candidate by a little bit, but not much in yet.

**9:26 PM EDT Lib 19; Con 3; NDP 1**  Ok just before the huge polls close, looks like the Liberals are decently positioned to hold a plurality.  Will be interesting how much the Bloc can take both from the other 3 parties with QC seats in the overall balance of power.  They are now leading in the Gaspe seat.  This will be a long night.

**9:30 PM EDT Lib 20; Con 3; NDP 1**  Okay, here we go!  Big poll close time.

**9:40 PM EDT Lib 20; Con 4; NDP 1** I'm only saying called seats, but Liberals are leading in a lot of spots.  Bloc not getting too many leads.  Bernier of the People's Party looks to be getting his seat. 

**9:44 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1**  One GTA suburbs seat with meaningful vote in, going well for the Liberals.  If they perform like this in the rest of the Toronto area, Justin Trudeau will have a very good night.

**9:47 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1** And now they're behind in that seat... so things are swinging a lot.  Bernier is also now behind in his seat.

**9:53 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1** Looks like the Bloc and Liberals are cutting up Quebec between them, which is pretty good for the Liberals, and a (mostly expected) disaster for the NDP.

**9:58 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Liberals are leading in 94 seats and are only seeing a net swing of -6 so far, which is really strong for them, since they could lose about 16 and still have a majority.

**10:00 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Polls are now closed across Canada.

**10:05 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1** Looks like the Liberals are leading in a lot of GTA seats, seems like all of the seats in Mississauga and Brampton so far are red, as well as the center Toronto seats.  Couple of seats up by Vaughan with a Conservative lead.

**10:10 PM EDT**  **CBC is projecting a Liberal government** (though probably more fair to say Liberal plurality).

**10:15 PM EDT Lib 23; Con 8; NDP 1**  Based on leads, Liberals are losing about net 20 seats, and probably on track to lose some more which would put them into minority government territory.

**10:23 PM EDT  Lib 26; Con 19; BQ 2; NDP 1**  Liberal minority government projected, big question will be whether Liberal+NDP will make it to 170.  Right now they are just at that line with leading + elected.  150 Liberal leading+elected, 20 NDP leading+ elected.

**10:39 PM EDT Lib 52; Con 58; BQ 10; NDP 1** Despite Conservative lead in locked-up seats, Liberals still leading in plenty more.  Looks like all the party leaders on track to hold their seats.

**10:50 PM EDT Lib 77; Con 73; BQ 18; NDP 2** I was mistaken about all the leaders keeping their seats.  Bernier is defeated, and the PPC is getting very little traction.  Trudeau and Scheer have won their seats.  May is leading in her seat, as is Singh (though Singh is only up by a few percent).

**11:02 PM EDT Lib 100; Con 85; BQ 22; NDP 6; Grn 1** Interestingly, the Liberals are likely to be in government despite getting less popular vote than the Conservatives, though extremely close right now.  33.8% Liberal, 33.9% Conservative.  Definitely the Liberals are seeing big vote efficiency advantages, with Alberta especially having some huge blowout ridings where the Conservatives do not get much of any advantage by winning by 50+%.

**11:15 PM EDT Lib 110; Con 95; BQ 25; NDP 9; Grn 1**  Looks like based on leading+elected that the Liberals would only need the support of one of the NDP or Bloc to have a working majority, so that gives them several paths to keeping confidence of the Commons (seems by far most likely they'd do that through the NDP).

**11:24 PM EDT Lib 114; Con 97; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2** Greens look to be getting about 4 seats tonight, which would be by far their best haul ever.  

We also are looking at a pretty definite popular vote / seat count split, with the Liberals now 0.6% behind the Conservatives in raw vote, but far ahead in seat count.

**11:28 PM EDT Lib 115; Con 100; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2**  Liberals are going to be locked out of having any seats in Alberta and probably Saskatchewan, which could be a problem for regional divisions.

**11:40 PM EDT  Lib 120; Con 106; BQ 26; NDP 11; Grn 2**  Going to end the tick tock here.  Results of the night seem pretty clear.  Biggest remaining question seems to be whether Scheer remains conservative leader.

Those who qualify for the universal Medicare plan would get four years to transition into it. 

“During the transition to universal health care, in the first year this legislation will immediately improve traditional Medicare for seniors and people with disabilities by covering dental, vision and hearing aids which are not covered under current law. The Medicare eligibility age will be reduced to 55 and Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D deductibles would be eliminated.
Moreover, during the first year, every child between the ages of 0-18 would become eligible to enroll in the Universal Medicare program.

A Medicare Transition plan would also be established during year one to provide affordable coverage for all Americans and to make sure that no one loses coverage.

During the second year of implementation, the Medicare eligibility age would be reduced to 45. During the third year, the eligibility age would be lowered to 35.

By the fourth year, every individual who is a resident of the United States will be entitled to benefits for comprehensive health care services and will get a Universal Medicare card that they can use to receive the health care they need.” — [Source](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/medicare-for-all-act-of-2017-executive-summary?id=943E7DB5-FCCA-4EA4-B215-A92F6642BA2C&amp;download=1&amp;inline=file)

And given that a lot of what they did was redundant because there were several different corporations, then most of them likely won’t be able to find a job working for Medicare.

How is Acosta responsible for providing lenient punishment, and was punishment lax compared to others convicted of the same crime?","[Jeffery Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein) is a wealthy financier who in 2008 was convinced on a single state charge of ""soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14."" [Some sources cite two charges]

His 2008 deal signed by current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta [included certain benefits](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article219494920.html):

> ...the multimillionaire was assigned to a private wing of the Palm Beach County stockade, where he was able to hire his own security detail. Even then, he didn’t spend much time in a cell. He was allowed to go to his downtown West Palm Beach office for work release, up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, records show. 

Additionally, the Miami Herald reports Acosta's non-prosecution agreement ""essentially shut down"" an ongoing FBI probe into linked crimes and victims, may have granted immunity to potential co-conspirators that were left unnamed, and that Acosta may also have violated Federal law when he [failed to notify](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html) victims of Epstein of this deal:

> Not only would Epstein serve just 13 months in the county jail, but the deal — called a non-prosecution agreement — essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein’s sex crimes, according to a Miami Herald examination of thousands of emails, court documents and FBI records.

> The pact required Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution charges in state court. Epstein and four of his accomplices named in the agreement received immunity from all federal criminal charges. But even more unusual, the deal included wording that granted immunity to “any potential co-conspirators’’ who were also involved in Epstein’s crimes. These accomplices or participants were not identified in the agreement, leaving it open to interpretation whether it possibly referred to other influential people who were having sex with underage girls at Epstein’s various homes or on his plane.

> As part of the arrangement, Acosta agreed, despite a federal law to the contrary, that the deal would be kept from the victims. As a result, the non-prosecution agreement was sealed until after it was approved by the judge, thereby averting any chance that the girls — or anyone else — might show up in court and try to derail it.

There were [36 victims cited](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48925932) in court documents.

This 2008 deal by Acosta has come under scrutiny because of [new charges against Epstein](https://www.apnews.com/f995d90cbfd943169f74a0dbb3b1eadc). 

Acosta has defended the deal as appropriate (from Source 3):

> “At the end of the day, based on the evidence, professionals within a prosecutor’s office decided that a plea that guarantees someone goes to jail, that guarantees he register [as a sex offender] generally and guarantees other outcomes, is a good thing,’’ Acosta said of his decision to not prosecute Epstein federally.

Speaker Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer are [calling on Labor Secretary Acosta to step down](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/alex-acosta-jeffrey-epstein.html) because of his handling of the Epstein case.

I have a few questions on this topic:

1) What authority did Alexander Acosta have to make the punishment against Jeffery Epstein more severe? How much responsibility on deciding the sentencing rests with Acosta?

2) Was Jeffery Epstein's punishment on ""soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14"" in the state of Florida unusual? In terms of time served, fines, sex registration, and prison/jail treatment, what evidence is there that Epstein was given preferential treatment?

3) Several prosecutors have stated Acosta's deal was unusual in terms of how Epstein was treated, but also how it affected an FBI probe and granted immunity to potential co-conspirators. Is there anything else unusual about the non-prosecution agreement or Acosta's handling of the Epstein case overall?",946,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/cba5a1/nancy_peolsi_and_chuck_schumer_are_calling_for/,1562722637.0,cba5a1

If you are at the wrong polling place they will not have your name on the list of voters. If you are at the correct location and are not on the list, you can still cast a ballot. Ask the poll worker for a *provisional* ballot. After the polls close on Election Day the state will check on the status of your voter registration and if there was a mistake made. The state must notify you as to whether your ballot was counted.

According to this report, ""the U.S. placed 26th out of 32"" OECD countries in terms of voter turnout. In an [April 2018 study](http://www.people-press.org/2018/04/26/3-elections-in-the-u-s-priorities-and-performance/), Pew also found that 90% of Americans believe both that high turnout in Presidential and in local elections is either ""very"" or ""somewhat"" important. A whopping 95% of voters also stated that it is important for voters to be knowledgeable. This raises the question of how to increase voter turnout and knowledge in the United States.

&#x200B;

Automatic voter registration and broader education seem to be effective tools of increasing voter turnout. [Research](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-oregon-increased-voter-turnout-more-than-any-other-state/) has shown that Oregon increased the size and diversity of its electorate by implementing automatic voter registration. The [United States Election Projec](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics)t shows that more educated voters turnout more than less educated voters, and in 2013 a [Pew Report](http://www.people-press.org/2013/02/05/what-the-public-knows-in-pictures-maps-graphs-and-symbols/) found that more educated voters are more knowledgeable about politics than less educated voters. However, some believe that cash rewards are the best way to increase voter turnout and knowledge. Many countries around the world have implemented compulsory voting, and [recent research found](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/01/08/compulsory-voting-results-in-more-evenly-distributed-political-knowledge/) that ""states using compulsory voting not only have higher turnout levels, but also more politically informed citizens."" One economist has [even proposed](http://www.econlib.org/archives/2013/10/a_cheap_inoffen.html) a simple test of political knowledge with cash rewards based on the participants' grades.

&#x200B;

What does experience and research tell us are the best ways to increase voter turnout and knowledge in a democratic system? How are or aren't those results applicable to the US?

based,NeutralPolitics,[META] Seeking user feedback on insults directed at public figures,"We've had some internal discussions around this as a mod team, and want to get some user feedback around whether we should prohibit comments which contain insults/name calling directed at public figures.

In particular this came up around a comment calling Donald Trump a cheeto.  We had similar issues around a John Oliver related browser extension which replaced the word ""Trump"" with ""Drumpf.""

There are other public figures subject to namecalling too, and any policy would relate to other public figures equally.  Quantity wise though, people talk about the President of the United States far more than any other public figure.

One issue to consider is how to deal with insults directed at public figures which may be factually justified.  E.g. if one wants to call a political figure a liar based on sources showing that they're knowingly saying things which are not true, we wouldn't want to ban that.

Under our current rules, the general consensus has been that a comment which otherwise complies with the rules would not break a rule by using an insult directed at a public figure, but would if insulting another user.  A submission which used an insult against would violate the rule against neutral framing.

On the one hand, [as hunters argue](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/us/black-rhino-hunting-permit/index.html), sanctioned hunts can be auctioned off to raise substantial amounts of money for conservation efforts, and the ability to bring home trophies  can make this more appealing for wealthy hunters.

On the other hand, [poaching is still a significant threat to elephant populations](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/2016_trends_in_African_elephant_poaching_released_–_CITES_MIKE_programme_03032017) and legalizing the import of trophies could expand the perceived market for poachers in America, giving them further motivation.

Given that both of these arguments are at least *feasible*, if not necessarily reality, what evidence is there as to what the net effect will be on elephant populations?

Edit: Additionally, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, [trophy bans are based in part by the US determining that these countries were not adequately contributing to conservation efforts](https://www.fws.gov/international/permits/by-activity/sport-hunted-trophies-elephants.html).

based,NeutralPolitics,"How sound is this analysis of violent crime and right-to-carry laws in the United States, and what sorts of policies might be gleaned from it (or critiques of it)?","I was trying to find a source for something else recently, and I came across [this working paper](https://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Do_Handguns_Make_Us_Safer_John_edits_6_9_2017_stamped.pdf) from the National Research Council earlier this year.  I'll note that the link above is to a copy hosted by the Crime Prevention Research Center, a decidedly pro-gun organization run by John Lott (whose research has been called into question quite a bit over the years, e.g. [here](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/john-lott-guns-crime-data/)).  The study is also posted [here](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510) and discussed [here](https://news.stanford.edu/2017/06/21/violent-crime-increases-right-carry-states/), so it seems like the copy I first linked is accurate.

Its authors attempt to evaluate what, if any, effect right-to-carry  (RTC) laws have on violent crime rates.  They find, based on their reading and analysis, that having these laws led to a 13-15% increase in ""violent"" crime over 10 years (with crime rates taken from FBI statistics), although oddly that there was not a statistically-significant increase in property crime or murder.

I don't really have the stats background to evaluate the study in much detail.  This left me with a lot of questions about the methodology used, and a few things in particular:

1. How accurate or reliable are their predictions about what crime rates would have been had those states not adopted RTC laws?  Does using existing data to model a counter-factual push their conclusions into unfalsifiability?

1. They lump all states that have these laws (which is 41 of them) and them compare those as a bloc with the 9 states that don't, also as a single group.  Is this reliable without looking at variations among those states, particularly in terms of relative restrictions on obtaining a permit or actual issue rates?

1.  Some states with RTC laws had the opposite result under their models, i.e. crime rates were below what was predicted.  For example, Utah's rate was 20.2% below what the authors estimated it would be without an RTC law (p. 92), Virginia's was 3.6% below (p. 93), Maine was 16.5% below (p. 73), etc.  (The state-by-state graphs start on p. 63.)  Should this have a greater impact on their ultimate findings than it did?

1.  For murder rates, initially the authors note that there was not a statistically-significant rise related to RTC laws.  They say (p. 43) that they do find a statistically-significant increase with certain adjustments: specifically, they took what their model says the incarceration rate would be, compare that to what it actually was, and then use that to infer what the murder rate would have been without the RTC law based on a measure of how police and incarceration rates effect crime generally. How strong, ultimately, are these conclusions?

Aside from being politically charged, this is an area with what seems like precious little research.  This paper is quite recent (published in July 2017), and it seems to me that any discussion based on it has to start with whether its conclusions are valid to begin with.",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7d1g0x/how_sound_is_this_analysis_of_violent_crime_and/,1510717983.0,7d1g0x

based,NeutralPolitics,What evidence exists to support the claim that the long-term benefit of repatriation of American manufacturing outweighs the immediate higher costs and will spur higher growth?,"Yesterday Peter Navarro (the White House Trade Council director) [was on NPR](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/19/538148732/white-house-trade-council-director-touts-made-in-america-week), making an argument for the repatriation of American manufacturing.  I'm going to take this point by point here:

>NAVARRO: Well, I think you start with the idea that we've had 15 years of subpar growth - 2 percent or below. Prior to 2001, we grew at 3 and a half percent. The big difference has been the entry of China in particular into the World Trade Organization and our markets. And we've just been hammered. What that does as a proxy basically is it drains essentially the lifeblood out of our manufacturing economy, out of our communities, out of our tax bases.

The first part of this statement [may be an exaggeration](https://www.thebalance.com/us-gdp-by-year-3305543), but [one study](https://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/china-paper.pdf) suggests that:

>Conservatively, it [rising Chinese import competition] explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in exposed labor markets.

However, [other economists dispute](https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21718513-china-shock-has-not-been-debunked-it-worth-understanding) at least some of these claims, arguing that studying the effects of extra Chinese supply  in isolation rather than in conjunction with something happening in America over-inflates the purported effect on the labor market.  Still [others argue](http://www.nber.org/papers/w19376.pdf) that the net welfare benefit to the US of stopping free trade with China would roughly be equal to the benefit gained by cheaper Chinese imports.

**Is the US-Chinese Trade deficit a significant factor in the decline of American manufacturing & growth?  Is it balanced by the benefit of cheaper imported goods for consumers?**

Navarro further goes on to assert that:

>What's interesting is that with every different country that we have a large trade deficit with, we have a different set of problems - with Mexico, for example - cheap labor. With Germany, they have a misaligned currency. So if you address these issues of unfair trade practices, if you get better trade deals, if you stop things like forced technology transfer or the theft of our intellectual property, if you ensure that the sweatshops of the world live up to international standards for minimum wage and safe working conditions, if you have reasonable environmental protection, then American manufacturers can compete with anybody in the world.

This is a very broad set of issues.  Focusing on worker compensation, the [Fair Labor Association states](http://www.fairlabor.org/sites/default/files/documents/reports/toward_fair_compensation_in_global_supply_chains_2016_report_only_0.pdf) reports that even when there are no legal violations in pay for workers in third world countries, the ""purchasing power of the current legal [wage] minimum falls below or near the World Bank poverty line"".  Additionally, the US has several trade agreements with [legally enforceable environmental protections](https://www.state.gov/e/oes/eqt/trade/).  My question here is:

**What measures currently exist to correct inequalities (wages/labor, environmental, intellectual property, etc.) between US manufacturers and those abroad and are they enforceable?**

Further, **what further protections would be necessary to enable ""American manufacturers to compete with anybody in the world""?**

Finally, Navarro argues:

>NAVARRO: Let me give you a number of answers to that. I mean first of all, a lot of the goods that come from abroad which are, quote, ""cheaper"" basically are cheaper because state-owned enterprises have made them heavily subsidized by their government, and they're dumped into our markets. Number two, if you look at this as a movie rather than a snapshot and you buy American in our government procurement policy - let's say it costs a little bit more - but what do you get for that?
...
What I'm saying is that if something looks like it costs a little more just 'cause it's made in America, when you cost it all out the benefits over time far outweigh the costs. Think about this. Over the last 15 years what has been the cost of buying all those cheap goods? We've lost trillions in terms of our tax base, and we put millions of people out of work.

The [Harvard business review](https://hbr.org/2013/04/how-chinese-subsidies-changed) supports the first part of Navarro's statement:

>In the Chinese industries we studied — solar, steel, glass, paper, and auto parts — labor was between 2% and 7% of production costs, and imported raw materials and energy accounted for most costs. Production mostly came from small companies that possessed no scale economies. Yet, Chinese products routinely sold for 25% to 30% less than those from the U.S. or European Union.

>We found that Chinese companies could do this only because of subsidies they received from China’s central and provincial governments. The subsidies took the form of free or low-cost loans; artificially cheap raw materials, components, energy, and land; and support for R&D and technology acquisitions.

>Since 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization, subsidies have annually financed over 20% of the expansion of the country’s manufacturing capacity. The state has willingly paid the price of economic inefficiency to accomplish political, social, economic, and diplomatic goals. Huge Chinese subsidies have led to massive excess global capacity, increased exports, and depressed worldwide prices, and have hollowed out other countries’ industrial bases.

as does the [American Enterprise Institute](http://www.aei.org/publication/the-importance-of-chinese-subsidies/), but further states:

>The harm is usually identified as large-scale U.S. imports from China. In fact, the main problems are barriers to American exports to the PRC and, perhaps soon, a growing battle in third markets. For the last decade, Beijing has acted as if competition is good for everyone except Chinese firms on their home turf.

**Does the current evidence suggest that imports of subsidized foreign goods are laregly responsible for slowing American growth, or is the problem instead barriers to American exports (or both/neither)?**

**Would the benefits of policies to protect American manufacturing indeed outweigh the increased costs of goods?**",467,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6ohgoj/what_evidence_exists_to_support_the_claim_that/,1500569005.0,6ohgoj

My question is if the bias for or against Net Neutrality is significantly related to an individual's overall political stance, or if the issue of Net Neutrality lies outside of the political spectrum for most individuals.

I believe the second prompt will be easier to discuss, as it requires less knowledge about society at large.

The spoiler effect, the idea that even if a third party gained massive amounts of popularity they would only take [away votes from the major party that have the most in common](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/the-midterm-elections-spoilers/382475/) with and will lead to the other major party succeeding leading to the third party never gaining the same level of support. These issues lead to the rise of only two political parties, which are [umbrella parties for a range of political beliefs](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/01/a-closer-look-at-who-identifies-as-democrat-and-republican/), which don't really satisfy anyone. 

So should we change from FPTP to another type of voting system? Would it change the deadlock we see in American government today?

[ Also for anyone interested here is an opinion piece I found that was interesting and provided a look at America with a new type of voting system though it was written 20 years ago so the ideas on the parties would probably change.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/01/a-closer-look-at-who-identifies-as-democrat-and-republican/) ",504,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4acaiy/should_america_move_away_from_a_first_past_the/,1457944167.0,4acaiy
patriot,NeutralPolitics,Are the concepts of cultural or national identity meaningful?,"Recently in my country (Britain) the rise of the UK Independence Party (A party who want us to leave the European Union and introduce stricter immigration controls) has prompted a more open discussion about culture, immigration, and identity, than has been possible over the last decade.

There are two things in particular that I would like to put forward for discussion but I hope that we can expand beyond these to other, relevant issues regarding immigration, identity, and multiculturalism.

The first was [a study carried out last year](http://www.futureukandscotland.ac.uk/news/national-identity-plays-key-role-voters’-views-europe) by the Scottish Centre for Constitutional Change at the University of Edinburgh, one of the finest universities in the country. This study concludes, as the article's headline states, that ""National identity plays a key role in voters’ views on Europe"". From this article:

>Professor Richard Wyn Jones, director of the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University and co-author of the study, said: “Although UKIP’s name – the UK Independence Party – suggests it is aimed at those with a British identity, our research shows that it is the party of choice for those who identify as being more English than British.”

>A clear majority of those in England who identify themselves as only or mainly English were for withdrawal from the EU. By contrast an equally clear majority of those in England who feel only or mainly British favour remaining part of the EU. Euroscepticism in England is clearly associated with Englishness and not Britishness. There was no significant relationship between patterns of national identity within Scotland and Wales and attitudes towards EU membership.

This is relevant because the current debate over the European Union in Britain (and in similar debates happening in countries like France with the FN, Belgium with Geert Wilders, Greece with both Syriza and the Golden Dawn challenging the EU for different reasons, etc.) concerns Britain's place in the world in the 21st century. And, more than that, it's about what the place is *for a nation state.* It shows that some people care about the *idea* of identity and where they came from and how they identify with that place and culture, while others seem to have less of an attachment.

Now, this is not a particularly relevant issue for those from the United States, but John Harris writing for The Guardian [argued that England is going through an identity crisis and is asking itself 'What does it mean to be English?'](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/20/england-identity-crisis-english-euro-scottish-elections-ukip-patriotism) While I don't intend on taking a side on the matter in this post, I think it's fair to say that *the debate*, the *crisis*, exists.

The issue of national identity has been brought to the fore in my country because of both the European Union debate and, more recently, the referendum on Scottish independence. Now, the Unionists won that referendum, but 45% of Scots would have left the UK if they had had their way. Clearly they do not feel British: they feel Scottish. So, again, there's a clash of identities.

While my examples/articles are generally UK-related, I think in principle there is no reason why the questions being raised here are not ones that could be asked in any country. What I'm really trying to do is show that there's a real debate going on in many countries (as I said, [the rise of the Front National](http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/frances-far-right-party-seizes-the-moment-and-the-youth#.fmy9nN3xZY) in France shows that this is not a debate limited to the UK) over what their national identity is, and how meaningful that very idea is at all. 

 So here are a few questions we might discuss:

1. What informs our national identity? Am I British just for being born in Britain, or is it more than that?

2. If we say (For the sake of argument) that it *is* more than just the location of our birth, what does internal conflict of ideas say about the cohesiveness of identity? If we say ""This nation believes x,"" but people whose ancestors have always lived there believe y, do they lack some part of that identity?

3. How meaningful is this idea of 'national identity' anyway? What about the problems posed by national borders, ethnic and cultural groups and overlap between the two? E.g. The division of India and Pakistan, as well as many countries in the Balkans.

3. What role does immigration and policies of multiculturalism play in redefining or hardening our understanding of what it means to have a cultural or national identity?

4. Is national/cultural identity, or cohesiveness, desirable? If so, what might be the government's role in achieving this?",61,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/2ujjim/are_the_concepts_of_cultural_or_national_identity/,1422902296.0,2ujjim

patriot,NeutralPolitics,Is protecting America the same thing as protecting Americans?,"*[I'm going to preface this post by admitting that I have a definite position on this issue, and although I try not to let that get in the way of considering opposing views, I concede in advance that I have a bias.]*

In reading [this article,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22809541) where the US Director of National Intelligence justifies recently revealed government intrusions into private communications, I noticed him make a very common conflation of two concepts that sound similar, but I propose to be distinct: **protecting America versus protecting *Americans*.**

The programs the director is defending are presumably counter-terrorism efforts. But in order to accept that thwarting terrorism is equivalent to protecting America, you have to believe that terrorist plots represent an existential threat to the nation. That means the potential attacks would be a coordinated effort likely to kill many millions of citizens, cripple our infrastructure, defeat our military and compromise our government institutions all at once. [The evidence doesn't support that terrorism rises to this level.](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/statistics-you-are-not-going-to-be-killed-by-terrorists.html)

The Soviet Union, with its bellicose threats and thousands of nuclear-tipped ICBMs aimed at the US, represented an existential threat to the nation. Imperial Japan, having invaded dozens of lands in a steady, five-year march across the Pacific, culminating in a full-scale aerial assault on a US naval base, represented an existential threat to the nation. Nazi Germany, having conquered half of Europe in just two years, and with its submarines attacking US shipping within sight of the East coast, represented an existential threat to the US.

Instead, what I think the Director is saying — probably without recognizing a distinction — is that these terrorists are a threat to American *lives.* But that's not the same thing. The loss of American lives, tragic as it is, does not in itself represent a threat to the nation.

In fact, it could be argued that the best way to protect America — traditionally the land of freedom, liberty, and justice under the law — would be to eliminate all these domestic surveillance programs, targeted killings, indefinite detention and the other associated anti-terrorism measures, because they themselves are a bigger threat to the American way of life than anything a terrorist can muster. But if we accept that terrorism does represent *some* level of threat (albeit not existential), supporting a reduction in counter-terrorism efforts means we would accept higher risk to our personal safety in exchange.

So, the question then becomes, are you willing to slightly increase the risk to your life in order to protect what it means to be American, or do you believe that it's the responsibility of the military to protect American lives, potentially at the cost of the American *way* of life?

-----

I'd like to make two observational side notes here: 

1. Reddit's readership skews decidedly young. If you were born after roughly 1988, America has been on a war footing since you were a teenager. You probably have no personal memory of what American society felt like prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks. There was no TSA, no Patriot Act, no warrantless wiretaps, no Department of Homeland Security, no prison at Guantanamo Bay, no drones, no ""Homeland"" or ""24,"" and most importantly, terrorism was generally seen as something that happened far away. For you folks, defending ""the American way of life"" may seem like a foreign concept, because for your entire adult life, this is the way America has been. I'm making some broad assumptions here, and I'm sure not everyone falls into this category, but as an older redditor, I want to point out that a large portion of the population remembers what it felt like to live in a country where the recently revealed government intrusions would have been considered a shocking overreach, rather than part and parcel of an extensive security mindset.
2. The traditional job of the US military has been to protect the nation from *existential threats,* while it's the role of law enforcement agencies to protect *American lives.* One of the reasons we don't involve the military in law enforcement tasks is because they have the tendency to view everything, including the citizens, as a threat.

elites,NeutralPolitics,"Bernie Sanders, Mass Movements, and Political Revolution","**Introduction**

[Bernie Sanders has made very large inroads](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/13/politics/bernie-sanders-2016-surge/) into the Democratic nomination race.  [In a recent interview on CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq_VSuQ6Vg8), he made this statement (around 3:00):

> I have a lot of respect for Barack Obama.  He is a friend of mine.  The biggest mistake I believe that he made, and I disagree with him on a number of policy issues, but his biggest political mistake is after his brilliant 2008 political campaign, when he rallied millions of people to stand up and fight back, basically what he said after he was elected, ""***Well, I will take it from here***, I will negotiate with Boehner and Mitch McConnell and Republicans...""  

>The only way we bring about real change in this country, which represents the needs of the middle class and working families, is when millions of people stand up and say ""enough is enough""!  They are organized and that is what I'm talking about when I speak about a ***political revolution***.  No president, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else can do it unless millions of people say ""you know what, this country belongs to all of us.  Our government must represent all of us and not just a handful of billionaires.""  It can't be done within the Beltway itself.  We need a ***mass movement***, and that's what we are trying to create and are succeeding in creating right now.""

This isn't the first time Sanders has used this language.  [In his candidacy announcement](https://berniesanders.com/bernies-announcement/), Sanders said:

>Today, with your support and the support of millions of people throughout this country, we begin a ***political revolution*** to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally.

Nearly a month before he officially announced his candidacy, Sanders issued a press release with the title [""***Mass Movement*** Forming for Bernie Sanders Campaign"".](https://berniesanders.com/press-release/mass-movement-forming-for-bernie-sanders-campaign/)

All three of these sources (the CNN interview, his candidacy announcement, and the press release one month beforehand) contain the statement ***""Enough is Enough!""***, which seems to be his unofficial campaign slogan.

---

**Definitions**

[This political science textbook](http://college.cengage.com/polisci/miroff/dem_debate/2e/students/chapters/chap10/overview.html), which advocates for a place for **mass movements** in a functioning democracy, has this to say about them:

> Although interest groups and mass movements are both forms of ***extra-electoral politics***, interest groups tend to focus on material goals, whereas ***mass movements seek broad moral and ideological objectives that affect the entire society.*** Consequently, the goals of mass movements are not easily subject to compromise. Also, the tactics that mass movements employ distinguish them from interest groups. These include ***demonstrations, boycotts, strikes, sit-ins, civil disobedience, riots, and even violence. Mass movements do not specifically target decision makers as do interest groups; rather, they seek to inform and activate broader publics who will then pressure decision makers.*** By broadening the scope of the conflict protesters hope to gain power in order to overcome institutional obstacles. Mass movements, then, carry potential for large-scale participation and offer the underrepresented a chance to be heard. They are necessary because no democracy is fully attentive to all its citizens all the time.

> Given their confrontational and participatory nature, mass movements have been the subject of heated debate between elite and popular democrats. ***Elite democrats are suspicious that mass movements can quickly become lawless mobs. Passions, as the Federalists said, need to be filtered through representative institutions.*** Elite democrats claim that the goals of mass movements are often utopian and impractical. To elite democrats, mass movements lack concrete programs for reform, seeking instead moral goals that are unrealizable and threaten democratic rule. Elite democrats believe that the tactics that mass movements use encourage society to divide into warring camps, undermining the norm of tolerance necessary for a healthy democracy. Movements are not expressions of people's natural desire to participate in politics; instead, elite democrats charge, people are drawn into them by clever leaders who play upon their emotions.

> Whereas elite democrats see protest tactics as leading to irrational actions, popular democrats view mass movements as both beneficial and necessary for democracy. Within the rules of American politics, periodic elections and interest group bargaining do not capture the full promise of American democracy. ***For popular democrats, mass movements are ways for citizens to communicate directly with government. Protest politics is necessary to bring about greater equality in the political system. Previously neglected groups or causes are organized in mass movements to overcome the inertia of the American system of checks and balances.*** Popular democrats believe mass movements are not threats to democracy. Rather, mass movements fulfill the expectations of democracy by bringing more and more groups into full-fledged American citizenship.

[This abstract](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2765544?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) seeking to define **political revolutions** says this:

>The term ""revolution"" is variously defined within and without the social science field. At least three distinct conceptions are discernible. Revolution as a political phenomenon.-Bodin, Small, Adams, Sorokin, Ross, Martin Dewe, Edwards, Webster, the Pauls, and Spargo appear to consider revolution ***a purely political phenomenon, a change in the location of sovereignty.*** Revolution as abrupt social change.-Le Bon and Ellwood suggest that the term includes any sudden or apparently sudden social change, so that political revolution is but one of several types. Revolution as change in the entire social order.-A third conception is that of change so drastic as to involve all phases of the social organization. Revolution may be political, but it has also religious, economic, industrial, and other aspects. Hyndman states this conception, and Summer, Parsons, and Finney appear so to use the term. Revolution a change in attitudes.-An explanation of such variation in the current conceptions of revolution appears in the fact that no writer has described revolution in its entirety. When normal social change is, for any reason. obstructed, there develops a widespread unrest which attaches itself to the most obviously offensive aspects of the social structure. ***The unrest and the collective behavior which often follows represent, to most writers, revolution.*** The more significant chages [sic] have, however, already occurred in the attitudes fundamental to the traditional institutional order.

At its most benign, a ""political revolution"" equates to regime change.  The academic consensus paints ""unrest"" and ""collective behavior"" as being defining traits.  When combined with ""mass movements"", this behavior can manifest violently.

**Questions**

***Using available evidence, especially Sanders's own statements, as support***, how ""benign"" do you consider Bernie Sanders's candidacy to be?  Do you think the language he is using is purely rhetorical in that the above definitions are too literal to explain Sanders's positions?  Or, do you think that, especially given that he has been explicit that he believes mass movements need to foment ***after*** he is elected POTUS (and thus are not relevant to the electoral process), that he is engaging in something far beyond politics in a representative democratic setting?  Do you think he would advocate for violence?  How disruptive do you think a Sanders presidency would be for the United States?

elites,NeutralPolitics,The effect of age distribution on social and political stability,"I've been pondering this question for a time, and I'd like to know what this subreddit thinks about it.

The gist of my theory (obviously not invented by me, but accumulated from various sources) is that the age distribution of a country has a fundamental impact--perhaps the *most* fundamental impact--on the social and political stability of a country.

It seems to correlate very well with many historical events. In the 1960's, the US suffered social unrest from the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War protests; France had the revolution of 1968; and China had various political upheavals culminating in the Cultural Revolution. Mexico had the 1968 massacre, while Eastern Europe had the Prague Spring. There's more on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_of_1968) about this time period if you'd like a read.

Of course, this could all be a massive case of selection bias, but it seems to me that protesting against the ""bureaucratic elite"" or the ""established order"" is something that is very characteristic of young people. Older people, in my view, rarely go to the streets for such vague concepts; they protest for very bread-and-butter issues, like pensions and taxes. Furthermore, the aforementioned countries had very different political systems and national conditions, yet the protests all occurred around the same time, for at least superficially similar reasons.

If we consider the fact that the post-WWII era was a baby boom period for many of these countries, we see that the baby boomers would be right around their late teens and early twenties around this time, the prime age for agitation.

If we look at the most unstable countries today, they're usually the countries with the some of the youngest populations: Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab World. Of course, there are *lots* of reasons why these countries suffer from unrest aside from the age distribution, but if we look at the *expressions* of discontent--mass protests, street action, calls for revolution with vague ideas of what comes next--as well as *who* is protesting, we see that much of this is the work of young people.

In contrast, if we look at Europe (a very old continent), the instability is really not too severe despite some very severe conditions. There are protests and street action in Spain and Greece, for example, which are suffering from depression-level unemployment, but no serious movements to overthrow the government. Again, there may be *lots* of reasons that this is the case (better unemployment benefits, for example), but does the fact that both Spain and Greece have median ages of over 40 years have anything to do with it? All else being equal, would we see the same level of relative stability if the median age was 25? In contrast, what if the Arab World had a median age of over 40? Would we see less unrest?

sheep,NeutralPolitics,What kind of regulations would be lifted by the TTIP?,"I know almost nothing about trade, but recently read that the TTIP would lift non-business-friendly regulations in the EU.

* Similarly, are *unarmed* black people shot disproportionally more?
* Are white officers more likely to shoot black people than vice versa?

For a quick background, in May 2019, the House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to Don McGahn, former White House Counsel, to compel testimony regarding “Trump’s efforts to impede former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.”[[1]( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mcgahn/u-s-appeals-court-grants-trump-bid-to-block-mcgahn-testimony-to-congress-idUSKCN20M38Z)] McGahn defied the subpoena under the direction of the Trump Administration, which “argued both that senior presidential advisers are ‘absolutely immune’ from being forced to testify to Congress about official acts and that courts lack jurisdiction to resolve such disputes.”[[1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mcgahn/u-s-appeals-court-grants-trump-bid-to-block-mcgahn-testimony-to-congress-idUSKCN20M38Z)]

The House Judiciary Committee sued in August, and the judge overseeing the case ruled that McGahn must testify in November.

> Counterintelligence investigators had to consider **whether the president’s own actions constituted a possible threat to national security.**

I've been struggling with the idea that the President can be a National Security threat if they themselves have the authority to determine National Security policy, or as [explained here](https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-grounds-can-fbi-investigate-president-counterintelligence-threat):

> ...the very determination of the U.S. interest in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy—are presidential prerogatives. The Supreme Court has often affirmed, many times since United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., that it is the president himself, not the executive branch, who possesses “the very delicate, plenary and exclusive power … as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations—a power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress.” Moreover, the president has plenary control within the executive branch of the intelligence power and classified information, which is defined, by the president, in terms of harm to national security.

> **In short, the president is the person constitutionally charged with determining what constitutes the national security interest and national security threats for the executive branch, which is where the FBI is located.**

This seems to run counter to the view of James Baker, former general counsel to the F.B.I.:

> If the president had fired Mr. Comey to stop the Russia investigation, the action would have been a national security issue because it naturally would have hurt the bureau’s effort to learn how Moscow interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Americans were involved, according to James A. Baker, who served as F.B.I. general counsel until late 2017.

I have a couple of questions:

1: What authority does the President have in determining National Security issues/policy, and is this power absolute or is it shared?

2: If the President *does* set the National Security agenda, is it possible for they themselves to be a threat?

agenda,NeutralPolitics,What are the pros and cons of continuing austerity programs (e.g. Greece)?,"This summer has seen extreme weather, in particular extended heat waves and wildfires, across the globe- including Europe, South Asia, Japan, and the United States. Leading experts believe such concetrations of extreme weather are 'the face of climate change' as [Prof. Michael Mann of Penn State University says](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/27/extreme-global-weather-climate-change-michael-mann).

This week saw deadly wildfires near Athens, with close to a hundred dead and widespread damage. The government has [received criticism for its response](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/greece-wildfires-firefighters-attack-government-response), including from Greece's Federation of Firefighters. Within that story is an argument that the loss of life was influenced by Greek's austerity programs:

>Echoing Varoufakis’s argument that austerity inflicted on Greece had also played a role in the inability of authorities to respond effectively to the disaster, Stathopoulos admitted that budget cuts had rendered at least 30% of the service’s fire engines useless. The debt-stricken country has applied the tough measures in return for bailout loans to keep bankruptcy at bay.

>“About 15% of our fleet of 1,750 trucks are off the roads because they have chronic problems and are old,” he said. “Another 15% are in need of spare parts which we can’t afford. As firefighters we take an oath to protect people and their properties. We know when to recommend that areas be evacuated, but for some reason our recommendation was not heard. This is a huge tragedy for our country and apologies are owed.”

**Austerity, the process of reducing the deficit (and perhaps the debt) of a state through tax increases and budget cuts,** has been a common theme of post-Great Recession Europe. Greece has had an unusually long, severe austerity regime running, approaching a decade and length ([see the latter part of the BBC's timeline of Greek history](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216)). The European Union, in its negotiations with Greece, have demanded cuts to the fire service that led to its budget being [reduced almost a quarter from 2009 levels](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-greek-tragedy-suprise.html).

Austerity has been promoted by many establishment officials and economists. A famous academic study by Reinhart and Rogoff of Harvard found that high national debt inhibited growth. While some of their underlying math has since been challenged, [there is a substantial community that believes their findings are still true](https://www.ft.com/content/2df58ce0-a8ba-11e2-bcfb-00144feabdc0) and support austerity programs.

The evidence of austerity being an effective strategy for debt is contentious. Two economists for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization known for advocating austerity through 'structural adjustment', [released an article saying that neoliberalism](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm), the ideology under which austerity is advocated as a solution, is 'oversold'. In part:

>However, there are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected. Our assessment of the agenda is confined to the effects of two policies: removing restrictions on the movement of capital across a country’s borders (so-called capital account liberalization); and fiscal consolidation, sometimes called “austerity,” which is shorthand for policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels. An assessment of these specific policies (rather than the broad neoliberal agenda) reaches three disquieting conclusions:

>•The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.­

>•The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.­

>•Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.­

There are numerous proposed alternatives to austerity as currently practiced (though [some commentators have insisted that there is in fact, no alternative](https://www.ft.com/content/7864786c-92aa-11e1-b6e2-00144feab49a)). The Guardian [compiled ten proposals from across the spectrum](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/alternatives-austerity-ideas-across-spectrum) in regards to the United Kingdom's austerity program, which began around the 2010 election.

""That unprecedented obstruction these last eight years is their legacy, and the American people should reject it by electing Hillary Clinton to build on President Obama's success so we can all grow and succeed together.""

For Women's rights we can use the United Nation's definition as provided by wikipedia
>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, enshrines ""the equal rights of men and women"", and addressed both the equality and equity issues.[134] In 1979 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for legal implementation of the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Described as an international bill of rights for women, it came into force on 3 September 1981. The UN member states that have not ratified the convention are Iran, Nauru, Palau, Somalia, Sudan, Tonga, and the United States. Niue and the Vatican City, which are non-member states, have also not ratified it.[135]

>The Convention defines discrimination against women in the following terms:

 >   Any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.

[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women Map (Red = non-signers)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/CEDAW_Participation.svg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>It also establishes an agenda of action for putting an end to sex-based discrimination for which states ratifying the Convention are required to enshrine gender equality into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women. They must also establish tribunals and public institutions to guarantee women effective protection against discrimination, and take steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination practiced against women by individuals, organizations, and enterprises.

As far as culturally specific goes, I am talking referencing places that discriminate women but it is absolutely apart of their culture. Places where it is obvious there are different rights for men and women and women are afforded less opportunities in life....places in the middle east come to mind.

If citizens accepted the restrictions in order to ensure that those of us who showed up to a hospital could get treated, does it automatically follow that we now accept it is the government's responsibility to broadly protect individual lives? And if the goal is now to protect the general health instead of protecting healthcare systems, would it be appropriate to impose strong restrictions like this to address other threats to public health?",219,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/gdj6og/is_there_a_policy_difference_between_protecting_a/,1588623299.0,gdj6og

freedom,NeutralPolitics,[META] NeutralPolitics: Origins and Purpose,"Gather round by the fire, children, and let me tell you a tale of when political discussion was held in quiet whispers and trolls walked the land.

Once upon a time (four years ago, to be specific), someone posted a link to reddit. Following that link took you to a video of Judge Napolitano eloquently channelling widespread frustration at the current system of government in the United States. This was all fine, but the title of the video, and the reddit post, was ""5 Minute Speech that Got Judge Napolitano Fired from Fox News"". The post hit the top of a major default subreddit, with extensive discussion in the comments about how awful Fox News was.

This all seemed to make sense, except for one thing: it wasn't true. Judge Napolitano's show, *Freedom Watch*, was indeed cancelled, but it was cancelled (as were his two previous shows) for low ratings. Further, the clip shown was aired months before *Freedom Watch* got the axe but was reuploaded to Youtube right after the cancellation announcement with an inflammatory title and no reference to when the segment was actually released. Finally, Napolitano was never even fired - he still works at Fox News to this day as their Senior Judicial Analyst.

The Napolitano video was the inspiration for this sub's creation, and a perfect example of why what we do here is important. Without dedication to informing our opinions through critical research, we will believe whatever seems to make sense and happens to fit our preconceived notions about the world. It should be no surprise, then, that the first group that responded positively to my posts desperately seeking interested redditors was /r/DepthHub.

While many on /r/DepthHub were critical of this sub's chance of success, they also pointed out that if it were to succeed, it would have to be through strict moderation policy akin to those found on /r/AskHistorians and /r/AskScience. Without a strong structure in place to maintain our high expectations and moderators willing to stand for those expectations in a fair and transparent manner, the place would devolve into just another political forum, where any old rant could masquerade as fact with a few vague mutterings of ""they have found"" or ""most people think"".

As the sub grew and gained periodic attention from the various defaults, we developed an appreciation for the importance of our role as moderators. After our first mention on /r/bestof, we removed at least 500 comments in less than an hour, prompting backlash from new users who began to post on the sub without even bothering to read the sidebar. We actively engaged these users and were able to bring content quality back in line with community standards, but it became clear that the sub could only grow sustainably if we dove in with every new wave of users and worked as hard as we could to educate and acculturate.

That was a lot easier to do back then. It took us 18 months to go from 30k to 40k subscribers. It took us 11 months to go from 40k to 50k. 50k to 60k, on the other hand?

28 days. It's been nuts.

With election season continuing to gear up, we don't expect this to change any time soon. Maintaining content quality is and always will be our number one priority, but it is a constant effort and we have been experimenting with a variety of different solutions. Some have been effective, some not as much, and some have annoyed a lot of you. We appreciate that you are still here with us as we figure this out, though, and we do take your feedback into consideration when deciding how to move forward.

From 3-7 PM EST today, Prof. Ann Larabee is [hosting an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/47rgtk/ama_the_wrong_hands_popular_weapons_manuals_and/) on /r/AskHistorians:

Gun ownership rights are treated as sacred in America, but what happens when dissenters moved beyond firearm possession into the realm of high explosives? How should the state react? Ann Larabee's The Wrong Hands, a remarkable history of do-it-yourself weapons manuals from the late nineteenth century to the recent Boston Marathon bombing, traces how efforts to ferret out radicals willing to employ ever-more violent methods fueled the growth of the American security state. But over time, the government's increasingly forceful targeting of violent books and ideas-not the weapons themselves-threatened to undermine another core American right: free expression.

In the 1886 Haymarket Square bombing, a new form of revolutionary violence that had already made its mark in Europe arrived in the United States. At the subsequent trial, the judge allowed into evidence Johann Most's infamous The Science of Revolutionary Warfare, which allegedly served as a cookbook for the accused. Most's work was the first of a long line of explosive manuals relied on by radicals. By the 1960s, small publishers were drawing from publicly available US military sources to produce works that catered to a growing popular interest in DIY weapons making. The most famous was The Anarchist Cookbook (1971), which soon achieved legendary status-and a lasting presence in the courts. Even novels, such as William Pierce's The Turner Diaries, have served as evidence in prosecutions of right-wing radicals. More recently, websites explaining how to make all manner of weapons, including suicide vests, have proliferated.

The state's right to police such information has always hinged on whether the disseminators have legitimate First Amendment rights. Larabee ends with an analysis of the 1979 publication of instructions for making a nuclear weapon, which raises the ultimate question: should a society committed to free speech allow a manual for constructing such a weapon to disseminate freely? Both authoritative and eye-opening, The Wrong Hands will reshape our understanding of the history of radical violence and state repression in America.

freedom,NeutralPolitics,What have been the advantages and disadvantages to women entering the workforce? Is it a net gain or loss?,"I have never been able to find discussion on this topic. However, I find it very interesting and feel it likely has had a huge impact on society. I wonder though (putting aside sexism claims) has it been a net gain or loss?

So, doubling the workforce (obviously it has quite doubled) would bring down wages due to supply/demand. This is similar to the effect of globalization on the job market. Additionally, the average income of societies where men and women work increases purchasing power and, when combined with lower individual raises due to supply/demand, could drive cost of living up in relation to wages per household. So, now where a single person used to be able to support a household/family, it is now more difficult. This, when combined with poor family policy (maternity/paternity leave) has a negative impact on families. People are more deterred and raising children (the next generation) becomes more difficult.

Is the above a correct thought process? Have any studies been done?

In terms of assessing net societal impact, you obviously must address the positives. For one, it is a result of freedom for everyone. That's an obvious benefit. Society further benefits from the potential progress attained due to the increased workforce size. Hopefully, the added minds to our problems helps us progress technological, medically, politically, culturally, etc.

freedom,NeutralPolitics,"Grand Jury Secrecy In The Modern Age: are the legal protections afforded to grand jury proceedings an outdated concept, or are they more necessary than ever?",">[No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment)...

The text of the Fifth Amendment gives a clear constitutional proscription against indicting a person for a capital or ""infamous"" crime. Unless and until that amendment is changed, grand jury proceedings are a fundamental aspect of our criminal justice system - without a functioning grand jury, it would be constitutionally impossible to bring charges against individuals for society's most serious crimes. See Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 687, 92 S. Ct. 2646, 2659-60, 33 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1972) (""The adoption of the grand jury in our Constitution as the sole method for preferring charges in serious criminal cases shows the high place it held as an instrument of justice."")^1

A corollary to this is, because it deals with the most serious crimes, ""[n]owhere is the public's claim to each person's evidence stronger than in the context of a valid grand jury subpoena."" In re Sealed Case, 676 F.2d 793, 806 (D.C. Cir. 1982). In contrast to a petit or trial jury, a [grand jury](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/grand_jury)^2 has incredibly broad investigative powers. It can range from 16 to 23 jurors and it can sit continuously for months, or even a year. Its purpose is to serve as a check on the prosecutor's indictment power by requiring members of the public to find whether there is probable cause, and to approve the scope of subpoenas and witness testimony. ""It is a grand inquest, a body with powers of investigation and inquisition, the scope of whose inquiries is not to be limited narrowly by questions of propriety or forecasts of the probable result of the investigation, or by doubts whether any particular individual will be found properly subject to an accusation of crime."" Blair v. United States, 250 U.S. 273, 282 (1919). 

The almost limitless inquisitorial powers invested with a grand jury has given rise to a strict requirement of secrecy. As the Supreme Court has explained, the proper functioning of a grand jury ""depends"" upon this veil of secrecy:

>We consistently have recognized that the proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings[...].^9  

>>^9 Since the 17th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public, and records of such proceedings have been kept from the public eye.[...] Federal Rule Crim.Proc. 6(e) codifies the requirement that grand jury activities generally be kept secret, by providing: [involved parties] ""shall not disclose matters occurring before the grand jury[...] A knowing violation of rule 6 may be punished as a contempt of court.” Although the purpose for grand jury secrecy originally was protection of the criminally accused against an overreaching Crown[...] with time it came to be viewed as necessary for the proper functioning of the grand jury.

>In particular, we have noted several distinct interests served by safeguarding the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings. First, if preindictment proceedings were made public, many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come forward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom they testify would be aware of that testimony. Moreover, witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be open to retribution as well as to inducements. There also would be the risk that those about to be indicted would flee, or would try to influence individual grand jurors to vote against indictment. Finally, by preserving the secrecy of the proceedings, we assure that persons who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury will not be held up to public ridicule.^10

>>^10  [...][T]he reasons for grand jury secrecy had been summarized correctly in United States v. Rose, 215 F.2d 617, 628-629 (CA3 1954):“ ‘(1) To prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated; (2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent persons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors; (3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may testify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it; (4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have information with respect to the commission of crimes; (5) to protect innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact that he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial where there was no probability of guilt.’ ”

Douglas Oil Co. of California v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211, 218-19 (1979)

""At the same time, it has been recognized that in some situations justice may demand that discrete portions of transcripts be  made available for use in subsequent proceedings."" Id.

This rule has recently come to a head in the wake of the Eric Garner incident. Amidst accusations that the prosecutor tanked the indictment of the police officer who allegedly caused Mr. Garner's death, the Garner family and a substantial portion of the New York community (as well as sympathetic voices from all across the country) have cried out for the proceedings to be published. See, e.g., [NY Post](http://nypost.com/2015/07/29/eric-garner-grand-jury-records-kept-secret-by-appeals-court/); [HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-garner-grand-jury-records_55b93da4e4b095423d0db80b). An action was filed by several interested organizations to unseal the record. They have asserted, as best as I can see, a handful theories supporting why it should be unsealed: 1) to understand the jury's decision not to return an indictment, 2) to promote transparency in the process, 3) to restore confidence in the criminal justice system, and 4) to engage in a meaningful discussion about reform of the grand jury process and police practices.^3

The District Court denied their petition. [Just yesterday, the Appellate Division affirmed the District Court's decision](http://www.nyclu.org/files/releases/Garner_decision_7.29.15.pdf) (link to opinion). Due to space limitations I can't copy the opinion here, but I have posted relevant portions in a comment under this thread [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/3f67zu/grand_jury_secrecy_in_the_modern_age_are_the/ctlmxb6).

So we know what the law is here. That's the law now, unless and until the Court of Appeals overturns it. But it causes me to wonder - is this policy right? Is it really as necessary as the Supreme Court and the Appellate Division make it sound? Have the reasons that caused grand jury secrecy to prevail in the 1700s waned over the passing of a couple centuries? Or is it possible that it's even more relevant now? 

In particular, I've been asking myself a couple of questions:

1. Does it make sense to reject a public interest based on another public interest? Should this require a showing that one is measurably greater than the other? Should courts be in the business of telling the public which public interest wins? After all, grand jury proceedings are fundamentally an exercise in using public money to convene members of the public to assist a public official in vindicating a public interest.
2. Is the public capable of discerning its own interest in this regard? Is it capable of understanding and interpreting grand jury proceedings, or will it only lead to increased misunderstandings?
3. Is the logic behind grand jury secrecy really sound? Is the fear that publicity would render witnesses unwilling to testify and allow criminals to escape punishment genuine? Or is it a rationalization that hasn't really been examined?
4. When, if ever, should a public interest outweigh those reasons? 
5. Is there perhaps a middle ground? Can there be an exception to the rule that will allow proceedings to be publicized if it deals with, for example, allegations of severe misconduct by a public official? 
6. Is it possible, in the modern age, to censor the proceedings sufficiently to protect the identity of witnesses and jurors, without compromising the integrity of the grand jury proceedings? (Notably, I'm posting this at roughly the same time that a dentist in Minnesota has been forced to close his business after killing a lion in Zimbabwe.)
7. Without getting into the details of the Eric Garner incident, was this the right call by the Appellate Division? Is it's analysis (especially the parts discussing why the public interest in that case falls short) sound? Is it post-hoc rationalization? If this is not a compelling public interest, what is? Is it possible to allow proceedings to be unsealed here without creating a precedent that would undermine the secrecy rules as a whole?
8. Is the ""compelling and particularized need"" standard appropriate?
9. Is there an alternative to the grand jury process? Is there an alternative to grand jury secrecy? Has the grand jury outlived its usefulness?

I hope you guys have some answers here. I'm stumped.

^1 Additionally, the Brazenburg case also notes in fn. 25 that at the time (1972), 32 states voluntarily impose a similar grand jury requirement:

>Although indictment by grand jury is not part of the due process of law guaranteed to state criminal defendants [...] 32 States require that certain kinds of criminal prosecutions be initiated by indictment. [...] In the 18 States in which the prosecutor may proceed by information, the grand jury is retained as an alternative means of invoking the criminal process and as an investigative tool. Ibid.

freedom,NeutralPolitics,"Post-Obergefell, what are the next policy frontiers for equality? What are the implications beyond marital laws involving sexuality or race? What about laws beyond marriage?","Recently, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in a 5-4 decision, [**__Obergefell v. Hodges__** (2015)](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf):

>The Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage
between two people of the same sex and to recognize a marriage
between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully
licensed and performed out-of-State. 


The Supreme Court in 1967 reached a similar conclusion in a unanimous decision striking down anti-miscegenation laws in [**Loving v. Virginia** (1967).](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/388/1#writing-USSC_CR_0388_0001_ZS)
______________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________

**The reason I believe the Courts reached their conclusions**:

*In each decision, the Supreme Court not only recognized that indeed, marriage is a right that precedes both the State governments and the federation of the United States of America, but indeed all governance, as it is a social and psychological bond which confers upon human beings who love one another, union, central to human survival and happiness.*

*It is viewed as an inherently ancient order, and indeed, one that the equal protection clause of the Federal 14th amendment forbids to the States particular exclusion solely based on either the race or sexuality of the participants.*


**My question**:

What else does 'equal protection' guarantee about laws? Is it limited to race and sexuality? Limited to marriage? 

Do rights, Constitutionally written or otherwise, *all* receive equal protection coverage? What standard must they rise to - - the adoration of the Court that marriage has received in *Loving* and *Obergefell*?


* Can States/Fed create laws which forbid marriages with respect to age? (these already exist, as do differences on age of consent to sex)

* Can States (or the Federal government) create laws which forbid  marriages between more than two people? (these already exist in those states which specifically ban polygamy)

* Can States create laws which forbid other rights, or forbid a manner in which those rights are exercised, even if other States don't restrict them in that way? 

* Can the Federal government create laws which restrict Constitutional rights more strictly than does any State without doing so by amending the Constitution itself? Do States which restrict rights less so than the Federal government have to abandon these protections to maintain 'equal' protection and Federal supremacy?

    *****************************BACKGROUND (skippable!)********************************




The 2015 Supreme Court ruled in *Obergefell* (albeit not uniformly, the dissent citing grounds ranging from questions about Federal judicial authority to review rights-challenges to laws administered by States via an interpretation of what those rights mean to the opinion of the reviewing body, to fundamental disagreement about the Federal authority to regulate domestic State policy) - - much on the same reasoning as *Loving* (1967), that laws forbidding same-sex marriage on whatever grounds would simply be inconsistent with the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment and Federal supremacy. 

In **__Loving__** (1967), Chief Justice Warren delivering the [opinion of the Court](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/388/1) [EXCERPT]:
____________________________________________________________________________
>This case presents a constitutional question never addressed by this Court: whether a statutory scheme adopted by the State of Virginia to prevent marriages between persons solely on the basis of racial classifications violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. For reasons which seem to us to reflect the central meaning of those constitutional commands, we conclude that these statutes cannot stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment.

>Because we reject the notion that the mere ""equal application"" of a statute containing racial classifications is enough to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription of all invidious racial discriminations, we do not accept the State's contention that these statutes should be upheld if there is any possible basis for concluding that they serve a rational purpose.

>The State argues that statements in the Thirty-ninth Congress about the time of the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment indicate that the Framers did not intend the Amendment to make unconstitutional state miscegenation laws. 

>*Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 489 (1954). See also Strauder [p10] v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 310 (1880)*. We have rejected the proposition that the debates in the Thirty-ninth Congress or in the state legislatures which ratified the Fourteenth Amendment supported the theory advanced by the State, that the requirement of equal protection of the laws is satisfied by penal laws defining offenses based on racial classifications so long as white and Negro participants in the offense were similarly punished. 


>There can be no question but that Virginia's miscegenation statutes rest solely upon distinctions drawn according to race. The statutes proscribe generally accepted conduct if engaged in by members of different races. Over the years, *this Court has consistently repudiated ""[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry"" as being ""odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.""*

>Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival. *Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942). See also Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 (1888).* To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.

>These convictions must be reversed.

>*It is so ordered.*

_______________________________________________________

cf. **__Obergefell__** (2015), whose [majority opinion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/14-556) was delivered by Justice Kennedy [EXCERPT]:

________________________________________________________


>The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity. The petitioners in these cases seek to find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same terms and conditions as marriages between persons of the opposite sex.




>Marriage did not come about as a result of a political movement, discovery, disease, war, religious doctrine, or any other moving force of world history—and certainly not as a result of a prehistoric decision to exclude gays and lesbians. It arose in the nature of things to meet a vital need: ensuring that children are conceived by a mother and father committed to raising them in the stable conditions of a lifelong relationship. *See G. Quale, A History of Marriage Systems 2 (1988); cf. M. Cicero, De Officiis 57 (W. Miller transl. 1913)* (“For since the reproductive instinct is by nature’s gift the common possession of all living creatures, the first bond of union is that between husband and wife; the next, that between parents and children; then we find one home, with everything in common.”).

>No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.

>The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.

>*It is so ordered.*

freedom,NeutralPolitics,The Tautocracy: a tinfoil-free idea of a government the US could realistically assume. I'd be really interested to hear feedback.,"**Why?**

The biggest problem in America is decision paralysis.

You want to fix your country, but there are so many individual components that are broken that you don't know where to begin. So you never begin at all.

You want a Leader: a single person who will say,

> Yes, you can place all your trust in me to fix things, and therefore you can place all the blame on me if things don't improve. The fault will be mine and no-one else's.

___

Politics is like a pyramid scheme: someone convinces you to invest your trust in them and then they use it for their personal gain. If they are caught, it's someone else's fault.

They get away with this because our Constitution decentralizes power. This is a nice idea: it takes into consideration that people want to trust a leader, and protects against the possibility that trusting the wrong leader will cause irreparable harm to the country. If no one person or branch of government is allowed to be trusted with ultimate responsibility, they will be less able to bring ultimate ruin.

The downside is that this shared authority allows politicians to present themselves as Messiahs but pass the blame to others if they fail to bring salvation. Presidents are elected with promises that they will bring salvation. The Constitution prevents them from having the authority to do so. When the President fails, it's Congress's fault. When Congress fails, it's the President's fault.

___

Democracies fail because they're too big. They allow multiple people to claim authority and therefore to assign blame to each other.

Dictatorships fail because they're too small. They allow one person to be assigned all blame because that person has all authority, but leave no-one else with authority to actually punish them.

If things get ""bad enough"" in a democracy, new politicians are elected, which does little to change the system itself. In a dictatorship, the only solution is revolution.

Democracies stagnate, dictatorships are all-or-nothing. A happy medium would combine the fairness of a democracy with the efficiency of a dictatorship.

___

**What if...**

The people of the United States recognize a President, a single person to whom we grant supreme authority, limited only by:

The Jury of the United States, a body of citizens whose sole purpose is to continuously decide whether the President is doing their job and whose sole authority over the President is to remove the President from office and punish them accordingly.

The Jury is composed of both a House of Representatives, a Senate, and a Foreman. Senators are elected, whereas Representatives are selected randomly from the citizens of every state. Each state has two Senators, and a number of Representatives proportionate to its population. No citizen of the United States will be prevented from being elected or selected to the Jury.

The Senate must meet in person to conduct business. The House, however, may conduct business remotely.

New Representatives are selected every three months. New Senators are elected every two years by the people of their states. The Foreman is elected every four years by the Jury.

The Senate will be one-fourth the size of the House. A vote of 50% of the Jury is required to impeach the President, who will otherwise hold office indefinitely. An impeachment may not be made without a replacement President having been chosen by the Jury. Otherwise, each President will choose their successor.

The President will have the sole authority to select and dismiss at will a Governor for each of the states. The authority of Governors will be limited only by that of the President.

A citizen of the United States is an inhabitant of a state who is a citizen of no more and no less than one specific state. Each state may set its own conditions for citizenship of that state. No inhabitant shall be prevented from claiming citizenship in another state for which they are eligible.

___

**Questions**

- *How is this different from a dictatorship?*

It does give the President give much more freedom than they currently have, and their motivation is no longer re-election: doing the bare minimum to scrape the approval of 50% of the country. However, the President are held in check by the Jury. They are more likely to do what is right rather what is popular, making plans that are unappealing in the short-run but will pay off in the long-run, but if the President is taking too great of a gamble, they may be removed from office.

- *Why three months for Representatives?*

This accomplishes a few things:

- Representatives are less susceptible to corruption. They come and go so frequently that directly influencing them to any effect takes a tremendous amount of resources.

- The quick turnover gives more citizens a platform for being heard.

- It keeps the Jury from getting stuck in habits.

- It ensures the most current issues are always the ones being debated.

- *Why are the Representatives selected randomly?*

This prevents the government from being made only of career politicians. Everyone has opinions and experiences worth hearing, but few have the time, money, and self-confidence to run for office. Representatives really will be of the people.

This means there will be some Representatives who are uneducated, abrasive, or generally unhelpful. However, that isn't so different from what we have now. It will also bring to light the biases and ignorances held by the people.

- *Why are the Senators elected instead of randomly selected?*

Career politicians aren't always bad. This whole system is very much about hybridizing different systems of government: taking the best bits from other systems. However, to ensure the ordinary citizens hold a slight advantage, the size of the Senate will always be just shy of what is needed to prevent a decision from passing the Jury.

- *What about state governments?*

Americans are inundated with elected representatives: sheriffs, commissioners, school board members, let alone Congresspeople, few of whom citizens even know the names, let alone positions on issues.

This system puts the structure of state and local governments under the authority of the state's Governor. This allows for greater experimentation with different systems of government, and for states to operate in a way that best fits their people, economy, and geography.

- *What's to prevent every new Governor from completely overhauling their state?*

Doing so would reflect extremely poorly on the President who chose the Governor, not to mention the Governor themselves. If the President is seen allowing Governors to abuse their power, the President will likely be impeached.

- *Where's the Supreme Court?*

In this system, the only federal crime is corruption at the federal level. Every other moral or ethical issue is to be weighed by the state in which it was committed as that state sees fit: for example, by having its own system of courts with a Supreme Court.

This is because beliefs about social issues vary greatly, and there is rarely a ""right"" answer. States should implement the policies that best represent the beliefs of their people, and people should have the freedom to move to states that best represent their beliefs. States having their own individual positions on education, marriage, gun rights, and so on, is better than a central government taking a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach.

- *The Civil War was arguably a conflict of states' rights. How will this system protect against a state wanting to engage in slavery?*

If a state allows actions that the people of most other states consider to be an abuse of human rights, that reflects poorly on the state's Governor, which in turn reflects poorly on the President. The system is balanced so that gross abuses of human rights should be punished, but states will not be able to micromanage actions that are more debatable.

Additionally, citizens cannot be prevented from holding office and will therefore always have a voice, nor from claiming citizenship in another state.

- *What's to prevent someone committing a crime in one state and then just moving to another?*

States set their own conditions for citizenship. To maintain friendship with other states and protect their own citizens, they will likely refuse citizenship altogether to those who have committed heinous crimes in other states.

- *Who's eligible to run for Office?*

Citizenship of the United States is based on two things: whether you're an inhabitant of a state, and whether you're a citizen of a specific state. If you're on American soil, you can pursue citizenship in any state for which you meet the citizenship conditions they've established. Once you've attained that citizenship, you're a citizen of the United States and therefore eligible for office.

- *What will the Foreman actually do?*

The Foreman is neither part of the House nor the Senate. The Senate and House are 25% and 75% of the Jury, respectively, totaling up to 100% — minus one vote, which is the Foreman. If the rest of the Jury is at a standoff, they provide the swing vote. They hold a good amount of influence as the member of the Jury who serves the longest term.

They also fill a more ceremonial role as the leader of The People (the Jury), holding in check The Government (the President).

- *How will the Jury enforce their decisions? What's to prevent the President using the military to hold power?*

The President is just a person to whom the people of the nation have chosen to grant authority. That choice can be revoked, meaning the President's authority is invalid. The President has command over the military only as long as the Jury grants the President that command.

- *What's to prevent the President from conspiring with military leaders to hold control of the country?*

The same thing that keeps him (or her) from doing so today: the consciences of the President, the military leaders, and the people who make up the military's ranks.

- *If the Representatives can do business remotely, how will they get anything done?*

This system has the Internet in mind. The House could manifest as an online forum, on which only the members of the Jury can post but which anyone can see. This will let the Jury bypass the parliamentary procedures that bog down today's Congress and multitask, and will effectively prevent the Jury from ever being out-of-session.

___

**How do we get there?**

Plan A is to try to push it through the existing government.

Plan B would be for the House of Representatives to be set up. This is pretty simple: it's just an online forum with posting access restricted to certain people, access being rotated to new members every three months. This would be the new system's Continental Congress, ironing out the kinks in the rules and methods of the new government.

Thinking things through and spreading the discussion is the first step. What happens from there is more complicated, and should be shelved until good headway has been made up to that point.

freedom,NeutralPolitics,Obamas speech on the war on the future of the war on terror; beginning of the end or just more talk,"Obama delivered a major speech on the war on terror, civil liberties, Guantanamo bay and drone policy today, my question is do you believe him why or why not?

you can find the transcript here http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/read-transcript-of-obamas-speech-on-counterterrorism-policy

In the speech he makes some pretty interesting statements on 
1.the future of the war on terror
""We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us, mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.” Neither I, nor any President, can promise the total defeat of terror. We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human beings, nor stamp out every danger to our open society. What we can do – what we must do – is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger, and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend.

2.Drone warfare
""much of the criticism about drone strikes – at home and abroad – understandably centers on reports of civilian casualties. There is a wide gap between U.S. assessments of such casualties, and non-governmental reports. Nevertheless, it is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties, a risk that exists in all wars...But as Commander-in-Chief, I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternatives. To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties – not just in our cities at home and facilities abroad, where terrorists seek a foothold... Where foreign governments cannot or will not effectively stop terrorism in their territory, the primary alternative to targeted, lethal action is the use of conventional military options... The result would be more U.S. deaths, more Blackhawks down, more confrontations with local populations, and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars.

3.Civil liberties
""the choices we make about war can impact – in sometimes unintended ways – the openness and freedom on which our way of life depends. And that is why I intend to engage Congress about the existing Authorization to Use Military Force, or AUMF, to determine how we can continue to fight terrorists without keeping America on a perpetual war-time footing. The AUMF is now nearly twelve years old. Unless we discipline our thinking and our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we don’t need to fight, or continue to grant Presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states. So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate. And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further. Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue. But this war, like all wars, must end. That’s what history advises. That’s what our democracy demands.""

4.Guantanamo bay
""As President, I have tried to close GTMO. I transferred 67 detainees to other countries before Congress imposed restrictions to effectively prevent us from either transferring detainees to other countries, or imprisoning them in the United States. These restrictions make no sense. After all, under President Bush, some 530 detainees were transferred from GTMO with Congress’s support. No person has ever escaped from one of our super-max or military prisons in the United States. Our courts have convicted hundreds of people for terrorism-related offenses, including some who are more dangerous than most GTMO detainees. Given my Administration’s relentless pursuit of al Qaeda’s leadership, there is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should never have been opened.Today, I once again call on Congress to lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO. I have asked the Department of Defense to designate a site in the United States where we can hold military commissions. I am appointing a new, senior envoy at the State Department and Defense Department whose sole responsibility will be to achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries. I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, so we can review them on a case by case basis. To the greatest extent possible, we will transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries. Where appropriate, we will bring terrorists to justice in our courts and military justice system. And we will insist that judicial review be available for every detainee.""

propaganda,NeutralPolitics,Enough. Enough of the Facebook political memes. ,"OK, I try my best to ignore the deluge of mostly uninformed political and ideological posts on Facebook because I realize I won't change anyone's opinion on the matter. However, I have a really hard time when ideas or arguments are watered down, made prevalent, and spread across millions of people on Facebook without any form of context. Millions of people repost, share, or like these posts without bothering to confirm their validity simply because it conforms to their particular ideology and it feels good to be validated. Doing so does not make you smarter than the next person, it does not make you look more politically savvy, and it doesn't contribute to the greater good in any meaningful way.

Being that gun control seems to be the hot topic right now, I'll make my point with the post going around about Switzerland. The post I keep seeing repeated on my newsfeed makes four primary points:

1) At some point in history people without access to guns were killed by corrupt (usually totalitarian) governments or militias. It even goes so far as to say the REASON they were killed is because they didn't have guns.

2) In Switzerland most households are issued rifles and most male adults are trained with weapons.

3) The Japanese in WWII decided not to invade America because they feared American citizens with guns.

4) Switzerland has the lowest gun related crime rate in the ""civilized"" world.

While I don't advocate revoking the Second Amendment and I do believe it has its place -- I think it's important we have actual discussions on this topic based on reality and facts rather than propaganda (and that goes for both sides of the debate). I'm no expert on gun control, nor do I believe I have the right answer, but I do see problems with the above points and our method of discussing this issue and others in general. In the same order as above:

1) Post hoc, ergo propter hoc -- which is just fancy talk for believing that because something happened after something else, that the first action necessarily caused the second. Just because there was gun control in a country and people were killed by their government does not mean they're related events. For every instance where you can show strict gun control and genocide hand in hand, you can see genocide where strict gun control didn't exist. (e.g. Iraq, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Zaire, Liberia, Yugoslavia, etc.). Just because two things happened doesn't mean one caused the other.

2) Yes, most households are issued guns and people are trained in their use. Conveniently the post leaves out the reason for this and that's because Switzerland has ZERO standing military. It uses a militia system where normal citizens with normal jobs are essentially on call for military purposes. Obviously that's not the case in the United States where we have one of the largest standing militaries in the entire world (and definitely the most advanced and well funded). Additionally the reason they don't have a military is because the government decided having a large organized group of people with guns is both an expensive endeavor and potentially dangerous one. (It's important to note most of the atrocities mentioned were committed by the military itself at the behest of the government in control) I'm not advocating that system in the United States, and I'm sure most people who want relaxed gun control laws aren't either, so let's stop bringing this up -- it simply isn't germane.

3) This is possibly the best piece of revisionist history I've ever seen and I think it's such a popular notion because it inflates our egos and makes us feel better about our belief that guns make us safer without critically examining the evidence. There is literally zero evidence that the Japanese even considered invading the US. Japan's primary objective during WWII was Asiatic conquest (China, Korea, Mongolia, Laos, etc.) They only attacked Pearl Harbor as a way of clearing the way for those conquests. If it seems odd that a military would be afraid of ordinary citizens who lacked military training, the ability to organize quickly, maintain effective communication (not even the internet or cellphones) and who had no funding other than their personal bank accounts, it's because it simply isn't true. Had the Japanese had any desire to invade America, their decision to do so would not be based on the fact that a bunch of John Does had pistols in their basement. Would America be afraid to invade Switzerland when every citizen has a gun and is trained to use them? Probably not.

Furthermore the belief that American citizens owning guns scared the Japanese in some way ignores the mentality of the Japanese military at the time. In the face of firebomb raids, some of which killed over 100,000 people and leveled entire cities to ashes, (keep in mind Japanese cities at the time were almost entirely made of wooden structures) and two nuclear bomb attacks the Japanese military refused to give in. Eventually Hirohito himself had to step in and demand Japanese surrender because the military simply wouldn't. Many citizens weren't even afraid of death -- kamikaze pilots weren't the only ones who took their lives in the line of duty. Thousands military personnel and even their families committed suicide rather than surrender as American forces island hopped to Tokyo. In Saipan alone there were almost no survivors of the 30,000 strong Japanese garrison, and two out of every three civilians, about 22,000 in all, died -- many by their own hands rather than Americans'.

To state it simply -- the Second Amendment and the citizens taking advantage of it had absolutely no affect on the Japanese decision to not invade the US. To believe it did flies in the face of everything we know about Japan, its military, and its people during WWII.

4) Finally the crux of the argument fails for the same reason as point number one. Just because Switzerland has high gun ownership and it has low gun violence does NOT mean that one caused the other. In fact, America has by far the largest number of guns per 100 people in the world and has one of the highest rates of gun violence as well (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_ownership_rate). In fact it has nearly twice the number of guns per 100 citizens as Switzerland. So if more guns ""obviously"" is the cause of low violent crime rates in Switzerland why is the reverse true in America? Because it's just not that black and white -- we live in a complex world people, any explanation that's as simple as ""more guns (or less guns) = safe"" should be examined critically because chances are the solution is as complex as the environment in which it exists.

Furthermore Switzerland in reality has stricter gun control than we do in the United States. In order to purchase a gun through a commercial shop citizens need an actual license (which requires both a criminal and psychological background check). The sale of select fire and automatic weapons are forbidden and the only way to get one is by receiving a special permit issued through the police (something which is rarely done and still has it's own regulations such as having to own a gun safe). And if you think the crime rate is low because people are afraid other citizens might be carrying weapons? Wrong again, concealed carry is almost nonexistent in Switzerland -- once again you need to apply for a permit (and before anyone responds I realize you do in the U.S. as well) however issuing such permits is a rarity in Switzerland and is usually reserved for people who work in jobs like security where having a gun is related to the job itself.

None of this is hard to verify, all it takes is a quick search on Google and maybe a little bit of thinking. This is not to say I'm for removing guns either; I believe in the Second Amendment and I think it has its place. The gun control debate is not (at least for most reasonable people) about banning weapons altogether nor is it about unfettered access to such weapons. Our world isn't black and white, it's every shade of gray imaginable, and our solutions and arguments should reflect those nuances. Unless you're just trying to stir up people or scare them there's absolutely no place for this kind of rubbish on either side of the debate.

So next time you want to enter the gun control debate, or any other, bother to check the facts and make sure your argument holds water before spreading misinformation. Whether or not it's intentional, it doesn't further the debate; all it serves to do is confuse the topic and prevent us from having actual discussions. It's great that people are interested in public policy -- that's what a democracy is all about -- but there is a serious risk when the quality of the argument dissolves into a shouting match. Because winning a shouting match isn't about being right, it's about being loud -- and that sort of argument benefits no one and helps nothing.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/16cr0k/enough_enough_of_the_facebook_political_memes/,1357870679.0,16cr0k

fake news,NeutralPolitics,What rules should be put in place regarding the use of surveillance aircraft by the United States government?,"A recent [Guardian article](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/02/fbi-surveillance-government-planes-cities) reported that the FBI admitted the use of fake companies to operate aircraft containing video surveillance equipment as well as technology capable of identifying and tracking cell phones over a large area.

According to the article, the Associated Press was able to track more than 100 flights associated with these aircraft over the course of a few weeks. The FBI claims that these are used stricly for ongoing investigations and that cellphone surveillance is rare, but the AP found in recent weeks, ""[flights] orbiting large, enclosed buildings for extended periods where aerial photography would be less effective than electronic signals collection.""

The practice of operating surveillance aircraft through front companies is not new, with documented instances dating back to 1988. However, recent technological development makes such practices increasingly powerful. Also, the Justice Department's ruling against the use of aircraft ""solely for the purpose of monitoring activities protected by the First Amendment"" is limited to unmanned aircraft.

Should something be done to establish limitations on the scope of government aerial surveillance? If so, what rules would safeguard individual rights while still allowing the FBI to do their job effectively?",75,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/38eyrq/what_rules_should_be_put_in_place_regarding_the/,1433360613.0,38eyrq
media bias,NeutralPolitics,"Is the 9th Circuit really ""the most liberal and overturned circuit"" in the history of the USA?","After the recent decision by the 9th Circuit to continue barring Trump's immigration restrictions there has been some backlash on conservative leaning media, concerning the history and reputation of the 9th Circuit:

Fox News has recently written an article that says: 

>It routinely is the most overturned court in the U.S. In 2012, the Supreme Court reversed 86 percent of the rulings it reviewed from the ninth.

and that

>Critics deride the court, calling it the “Ninth Circus” and the “Nutty Ninth.”

http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/02/09/ninth-circuit-most-overturned-court-us

The LA Times also has an article about the 9th Circuit from September of last year on the subject of it's alleged left-leaning bias. To quote: 

>The court’s reputation for leftist judicial activism is so legendary that conservative groups mount perennial efforts to split up the 44-judge court, the largest in the nation. In 2011, Newt Gingrich called for abolishing the “anti-American” circuit outright.

The article discusses some of it's historical appointments and liberal biases but comes to the conclusion that it's overturn rate is due to the size of its region and the huge amount of cases it sees. 

On the other hand liberal-leaning news sources (in my opinion) such as ABC take the stance that the liberal reputation of the 9th Circuit is overblown. According to ABC the 9th Circuit appears very liberal because of the large influx of appointees in Carter's administration. ABC says that these ""Carter"" judges are too advanced in age to matter or are simply dead. 

http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/scholars-liberal-reputation-9th-circuit-overblown-45316853

>But some legal scholars say the 9th Circuit's liberal reputation is overblown and that the court has moved to the middle as some of President Jimmy Carter's appointees — who were considered extremely liberal — have taken semi-retired ""senior"" status or passed away.

Other organizations such as the American Bar Association have rated the 9th Circuit very poorly and has given it the second lowest grade of any federal circuit. 

http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/intelprop/magazine/LandslideJan2010_Hofer.authcheckdam.pdf

The 13 Circuits are graded by their performances with respect to Supreme Court decisions in the above .pdf link.  

I noticed that the 9th Circuit is actually the second most overturned court. I also noticed that the 6th and 10th Circuits are of, essentially, the same caliber in terms of being overturned by SCOTUS. 

Only 14/44 of the active and open seats (only 4 vacant seats at the moment) in the 9th Circuit have been appointed by conservative presidents ( Reagan, Bush Jr and Sr, and Nixon). The rest have been appointed by Carter, Clinton, and Obama. 

Is the 9th Circuit truly a liberal biased court, in the way certain media outlets are making them out to be? Do they suffer from overturns because they have the largest geographical spread of any Circuit? What historical context should we consider when discussing the reputation of the 9th Circuit? How much does the size of the 9th Circuit's region really affect the dispositions of this circuit?

media bias,NeutralPolitics,Innovative Policy Series - Ontario's Municipal Appeals Board,"Hey all, this is an NP 'mini-series', where we'll sticky a neat policy problem and solution (monthly) so that the issue, the pros and cons of the solution, any unexpected results, and alternatives can be talked about. Today: _The Ontario Municipal Board!_

---

In most parts of North America, zoning disputes between developers, planners and residents often have to go through long and incredibly costly court procedures, which slow down projects put forth by both city planners and private developers. Additionally, these procedures have been criticized because judges in such cases rarely consider practical planning concerns when making decisions, and often broadly defer to local government authorities. The result, [some argue]( https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/03v09n2/0306glae.pdf), is the slowdown of development and urban renewal as zoning decisions are made poorly and inefficiently, resulting in skyrocketing housing prices. 

For decades, the Canadian province of Ontario (home of cities like Toronto and Ottawa) has used a different method of resolving zoning and other municipal disputes: the Ontario Municipal Board. The Board is granted broad power over such disputes across the province, and has its members appointed by the provincial authorities. Stakeholders unhappy with zoning decisions can appeal them to the Board, which then resolves the issue quickly, efficiently and (theoretically) technocratically. Board decisions are difficult to appeal.

Proponents of the current system point out that unlike in much of the rest of Canada and the United States, the Board [has suppressed the rise of housing costs]( https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-toronto-rent-trends/) in the region’s cities, largely through [massively increasing the approval of housing construction projects]( http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?cityID=12&statusID=2), and that furthermore, the use of officials appointed outside of municipal jurisdiction means that they are free from the local influence of disproportionally powerful interest groups and local politics, and that the Board is therefore able to reach its decisions quickly while taking into account city planning concerns, including housing prices.

On the other hand, opponents of the Board have criticized its [broad and poorly defined authority]( https://archive.org/stream/royalcommissioni05onta#page/2012/mode/2up), its undemocratic nature, and its common overruling of the concerns of local residents in favor of developers and city planners (though the extent of this bias has [often been questioned]( http://www.munkschool.utoronto.ca/imfg/uploads/177/villain_or_scapegoat_moore_final.pdf)).

What are the costs and benefits of such a Board? Have its policies in Ontario been successful? Could the policies be successfully expanded across the Canada, the US, or the world? What else should be done to combat rising urban housing prices?

media bias,NeutralPolitics,Why does the US continue to give military aid to Israel without the concession of a US military base?,"First things first: I tend to have a left-leaning bias. I've tried to temper it by citing news reports and sticking to facts.

This question popped into my head after reading about the [second squadron on F-35s that Israel is planning to buy with US military aid.
](http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-israel-to-buy-2nd-f-35-squadron-1000981787) 

I'm having a hard time finding any trustworthy and non-inflammatory information. The major American news media doesn't seem to want to report on it, while Israel's *Globes* almost seems proud of it.

I understand that it's a strategically important position in the Middle East, especially with the current tensions regarding ISIS. What I don't understand is why the United States would continue to give so much direct military aid without Israel allowing the construction of a US base. Especially aid for David's Sling, Iron Dome, and infrastructure to build American fighter jets, which could all potentially be used against US interests.

I know Israel lets the US use Haifa for the 6th Fleet, but [they are also letting a Chinese company build a new port on the Mediterranean and will be privatizing Haifa](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/28/israel-ports-idUSL5N0SN2EF20141028).
